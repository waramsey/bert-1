2410	0	a	This game is not worth it. Honestly, it will not capture your attention for long. ORION: Dino Horde is just another FPS that was quickly slapped together.
3447	1	a	A decent and simple game, basicly you just shoot dinos :D it's a lot of fun
5841	0	a	I played this game on a free weekend and still thought it was a waste of time. The game was just terribly set out, I have to run for 15 minutes to get to some random checkpoint and I wasn't sure why, the guns all feel similar, the dinosaurs don't even feel particularily fun to fight. You can get the game for less than 50p right now, and I'd say it still isn't worth it.
1158	1	a	I didn't exspect this game to be this good boy was i wrong! Buy this game now ,trust me on this one
4100	1	a	This game is brilliant! it's tons of fun! me and a few friends just got it for the hell of it to have a go and oh my god! it's one of the best games i've played it's addicting looks nice and funny as hell!  Trust me grab a few friends and try it out!  Don't let me play time say otherwise!
486	1	a	Quasi-Tower Defense meets Hack 'n' Slash in such a way thats incredibly fun. If you enjoy either genre to ANY degree, you're missing out if you don't get this game. It is amazing.
4809	1	a	great idea very simaler to alot of sandbox shooters/consturction games my pc had trouble handeling the screen rate
1203	1	a	Tower defense game mixed with first person shooter. Funny comments in game. Plays really well. Three difficulty levels provide great challenge.  [my ranking: 6.5/10]
3700	0	a	I'll give you 10â¬ if you delete the game from my library!!!
2604	1	a	I paid less than 75 American cents ($0.74) for this game today. And me and my friends just got over 3 hours of some of the most fun gameplay we've had in years.  At first, I thought, 'Hey, this movement is clunky', and then I remembered that this wasn't a $60.00 Battlefield X title. But it wasn't any worse than any FPS I grew up with like Wolfenstein, Half-Life, and... um... other stuff.  5 minutes in, all bets are off, and you're loving killing dinosaurs. 10 rounds of 'pull the trigger and shoot' and then you start to figure out an upgrade path for your weapons and skills. It's about 30 minutes of confusion, and then it clicks, and this game is fun as all get out.   The visuals are amazing. The levels are huge. The weapon selection is vast. The vehicles are ridiculous. Yes, vehicles. Not on-rails. Free vehicles like Battlefield.  Case in point: by the last two sessions tonight, the final map is an all-out dino rampage. Two of our three players figured out how to fly the gunships, keep them in the air, while providing air cover for a tank driving back to base. The slow moving tank was getting swarmed, and the gunships were raining missles down on the dinos attacking the tank. Meanwhile, the gunships were getting swarmed my pterydactyls. They had ground-cover from the bots though.   Seriously. It's not earth-shattering physics or revolutionary gameplay. But it's some of the most fun you can have goofing around with friends. It's an AMAZING game.  The maps are beautiful and huge. The layouts are really smartly done, And the progression for each level is smart too.  I wish there was a way to make the progress from levels 1-&gt;10 carry over to session 11-&gt;20, but you quickly realize that it's a 10-match world, and you scale appropriately. When the next round comes up, you start with nothing, but you're a little smarter. And you WILL play the next round, because its fun as hell.  Buy this. Buy the 4-pack and hand it out to people on your friends list.   I love this game at under a buck, but I'd have no probalem dropping $20 for this one.
1982	1	a	so I played this game for 1 hour and I bought it for a 96% discount, so it costed me only 0.20$, my 1st expression when I saw this was like, might as well offer the game for free with this discount :)  it`s original price is 5$, I have bought like 6 copies of these to send them as gifts.   -gameplay:- the game is pretty easy to play and very fun, but one most be sort of skilled with keyboard and mouse to play the game enjoyably, I don`t think it supports gamepad.  -graphics:- its one of the simplest 2d graphics I have seen but it`s crafted well and looks nice and smooth. I really love the simplicity factor but the menu layout could be better.   -story and puzzles:-  its about a robot ships being sent to out space in the future to discover planets in other galaxies. u simply orbit the planets with ur little rocket ship and hit deploy on various places on the planet to deploy the little cute catty sounded robot.  u face plenty of obsacles and the game appears to have many missions, u have to stack stuff, block things and slide things to reach your goal. nothing too complicated but it`s fun and rewarding.   conclusion:  coming from a hardcore, eye candy fps, strategy and racing gamer, this game may not be as appealing but after I played it I truely loved it. it`s definitly a kid game. but one must always keep the inside kiddo in us alive and happy :) I`m definitly gifting alot of copies to my young cousins since they would love it:)  I would say it's even worth 5$ full price and even better with 96% discount.
3645	0	a	Trash.
34	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
4869	1	a	they changed the name 3 times now.
2405	1	a	This game is awesome fun with friends, would recommend this game to anyone.
5558	0	a	UPDATE ON MY YEARLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME REVIEW   Shock in the gaming community as the developers of ORION once again caught Stealing assets from other games
5194	0	a	I honestly really like this game, its fun, fast paced and easy to get into.  Its actually really fun but the reason why I made this review a bad one, is that the community of this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage. I have died in the past because I got crushed by my own CAR! So you know what this tard does, he doesn't revive me, he grabs my car and drives away and leaves me. Mind you, this is not the only time this had happened. There have been many times where I sometimes got crushed by my own vehicles. Now I understand if you are against a T-Rex at point blank range and you can't revive me, but sometimes, there are like 4 people attacking the same damn dinosaur and while I'm dying at the back, they will ignore you and leave you to die and lose all your gear. Another problem is the vehicles. Let's say for example I go do the objective, and once I finish it, I get a helicopter or a jeep as a reward, but then some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ charges in while I'm killing dinosaurs, preparing to get into my car and this guy just takes it and drives away and leaves me a with a T-Rex while I'm heavily wounded.  So here is my overview of the review. The gameplay is awesome and really fun and the graphics are pretty good for a one euro game but the community is absolutely terrible, they will leave you even when they are in no harm at all, people who done nothing for the team will charge and steal all your vehicles.  5/10
1563	1	a	This is a well-made tower defense game. It does not add anything new to the genre but it is fun and well balanced.   There is no storyline but there is a vague World War 2 theme. There are dozens of levels to play, each with dozens of waves, with each wave taking 1-4 minutes to complete. As you complete levels you earn ugrades to spend on various kinds of turrets. This is casual entertainment at its finest.  My main criticism is that some of the levels, particularly the naval levels, take too long to complete. If your turrets just sank the first super-slow but super-tough battleship, then the next dozen such battleships will surely meet the same fate. Yes, you can speed up the action, but there is a problem with repetition.  But this is a minor gripe which is fully addressed in the next game of the series, iBomber Defense Pacific. This game is quite inexpensive and definitely worth checking out if you like tower defense games!
2280	1	a	there be dinosaurs; u shoot them more importantly, u could almost buy a candy bar, or get this game instead
5346	1	a	Gameplay is awesome but the game makers have an issue in programming skills or something cause game is really laggy and flying dinos just appear in sky and i dont have time to kill them if everything laggs and i am on extreme difficulty. PLEASE FIX GUYS GAME IDEA IS GOOD BUT UPGRADE THE GAME BY ITSELF CHANGE GAME CODE TO LESS LAGGY AND GIVE US MORE WORLDS AND BETTER OBJECTIVES!!!!!
5521	0	a	Horrible
2671	1	a	This game is insane... and fun!
4272	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
778	1	a	Great blend of FPS and tower defense with fast paced fragging and some good laughs. Two thumbs up!
2769	1	a	It ain't â¥â¥â¥â¥. I dont get the exceptionally low metacritic score as it's pretty much what is. I would give it a 6.5 at best at full price and an 8 for a dollar. Good silly survival co-op if you play with friends kinda reminds me of killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicles. It ain't no Killing Floor though.
5961	1	a	It's definitely worth 99 cents. Not many people play this game. I think every game I joined we had at least 2 bots on a five man team. It's fun for 99 cents, but after playing for a bit, I can definitely see why it is 99 cents. I don't know, give it a chance I guess. You might like it and you would add to the player base because it is lacking. I guess I will recommend this because it's not terrible, and you can't beat it for 99 cents.
2007	1	a	Such a good game I've been playing it for hours already. BEEP will never get old. I
6287	1	a	I bought this game back when it was complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ but now it is amazing... Good job devs!
1926	0	a	Can't change volume, can't change anything, there is no options at all. You can't alttab, because it'll just play the music all the same and be in the background.  The game it's ok.
4646	1	a	This is the best FPS I've played in a long time!
6208	1	a	Im Happy I Got The Four Pack.
4002	0	a	I do not recommend this because it's a buggy, unfun mess.
2469	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
5333	1	a	right now as it stands the game is really good. It is a knock off of halo, however it is done really well.   Pros: Its just like halo, there are a ton of things to do. Endless replayabiliity, I have 124 hours into it and looking forward to another 124 easily. The dlc for this game is auto updated for you and always free. also for the price its unbeatable.  Cons: It used to be buggy but not anymore. you do sometimes get stuck in cliffs if youre jumping around on them, however that is fixed by just using the teleporter.  I 100% recommend this game to anyone, not just halo fans. Its a fun way to spend 100+ hours and not get bored with it.
4502	0	a	I remember playing this game on launch. Multiplayer was unplayable, singleplayer was barely playable. Since then it has come a long way, now I can call it a game without feeling too bad about myself. BUT saying it's a game now, doesn't mean it's good. Weapons sound like peashooters, graphics are washed out and ugly (this is what happens when untallented person gets hold on an Unreal 3 engine) and the general gameplay is not very entertaining. But it is much more stable now and you no longer see raptors spinning in place, so that's a step up.  There's just one more thing that needs to be mentioned: the game has changed it's title multiple times, it came from Orion: Dino Beatdown to Orion: Dino Horde to Orion: Prelude. Why is that? To escape the bad reviews it's gotten in the past? To trick people into thinking it's a different game?
4102	1	a	Nice game
6387	1	a	So.... First impressions?  This game is trying so hard to be... Halo + Turok. I mean the feeling i get, jumping straight into this game, with absolutely NO campaign dialogue, 0 tutorial, and no story as to WHY these dinos are assaulting me is just the utter lack of 'Wheres the bloody plot?'  So Gameplay wise, the controls are very hectic, starting off with what feels like a cursor movement of 10/10 setting i feel like my first few seconds id snap the neck of my avatar if it were a real person. After getting used to the controls, it feels and reacts very naturally, like any common shooter would. Controls follow the typical Forward back, left right, crouch and shoot functions. I like the addition of the shortcut commands, and that helps in a pinch instead of typing out the messages individually and having the text pop up on the screen.  Graphics.... uhm... The dinosaurs are very blurry, the movements are very sketched together, and the overall texturing of the avatars is very blurry. The landscape however is beautiful! Especially tying in the natural sun glare with staring up at the sun, the rain and drops on your visor/hud are very wonderful effects. The fog and the steam also is a very well designed mechanic. Just overall landscape wise is beautiful.  Sounds. It seriously sounds like some of the audio is played by the Halo announcer himself. Enough said.  Overall, I played this game for about 20 minutes of my evening, and first reaction it has alot of potential. This is definately a game that could do something but in the Multiplayer state it is, it feels too narrow. There are already too many GREAT and AWESOME FPS games that incorperate a wonderful and seamless Campaign or backstory, that this game would easily fall into obscurity for sheer lack of the ability for it to overcome that knowledge. The Lack of the story and the utter confusion just being dropped into the bunker that first time is very unsettling to a gamer who is used to having at least a little bit of a 'this is the universe' kind of opener.
367	0	a	Spent about an hour with it. Read how good it was in the reviews but this got way too old way too fast. Bought it on a sale so it wasn't that big of a deal for a dollar. I've spent more on worse.
5342	1	a	it is buggy (the movents) but if you have friends with who you can play it it should be fun, not as in i am looking to play something by my own then i advise not buying this.
4980	0	a	All i can say is the game is too repetitive...
937	1	a	Very entertaining game with lots of traps/weapons strategies and abilities to kill poor innocent orcs. Also I like game style and humour. Additional weapons in DLC may help too. Try it!
4609	1	a	Needs mor of that japanese puss puss
3168	1	a	why is this game so cheap??? It's game about surviving hordes of dinossaurs. Not that good, but not that bad either, let's say is so so.
3272	1	a	very fun and addictive game with quite a few game modes. fans of dinosaurs and a halo mixture will likely enjoy this
2498	0	a	Played this game in a FREE weekend EVENT (THAT'S WHY my GAMEPLAY TIME IS SET to 0 Hours) The sale price is a trap !! Don't buy it unless it is less than 0.49$  The game is one of those that u play for like 2 hours then never coming back to the game again Primal carnage is way better than this game  What king of openworld gameplay that can take only up to 5 players ???????
4016	1	a	Fighting against hordes of dinosaurs? How much better does it get?!
3203	1	a	BEST CO-OP SHOOTING GAME This game is Halo 4 and Star Wars combined.  Nice graphics, very fun to play with friends. However a bit buggy.
1134	1	a	
4733	1	a	Very nice game for only 0.49 euro :D
2736	0	a	This game is still crap.
4407	1	a	I've played it once with a friend and actually had a fun time doing it. While it may be underwhelming on the surface, it is very fun if you're willing to relax and just play a game a bit without too much thought involved.
2904	1	a	I bought this game when it cost Â£1.99 during a steam sale. Since that moment I can honestly i have never regreted my choice. This now under Â£1 game should not cost that much and i await the moment they put the price up and award themselves for the hard work they have obviously put into this. Would happily play Â£10 for this game as it is worth it. To any others that are looking at the game BUY IT NOW before they do what they should and make it cost more. Easily better than games such as Call of Duty and battlefield, It just needs more players and a wider community which it deserves
261	1	a	It took me cce 8 hours to complete first run on standard (not low) difficulty. Game offers variety of traps to serve one's 'style' - are you a direct damage dealer, tricky tactician, do you like traps to do all the work or do you like being engaged in a fight? These and many more options are offered. The variety of monsters, their stregnth, number in comparison with your abilities, traps and magic is well balanced. There are points in game where player must be very flexible. When you finish game, you can start with all upgrades and traps unlocked from previous run and do campaign from scratch. There are tougher monsters coming in already at start. This is sad, because I would welcome ability to play new game already on highest. I am not going to play again. Not because I wouldnt enjoy it, but because I have no time and want to finish other games, too. In short - great chillout game.
3678	1	a	yes it very GOOD........ i was spend 5 hour per day for level up it very good than old
2894	1	a	Wow i can write a rewiev for a game i doesnt have(Yet)  10/10 Not IGN
3100	1	a	For the price yes. Even though I didn't buy it... I did try it out and it was pretty fun. Bunch of kids, screaming: 'I'm going to eat your dinosaur â¥â¥â¥!' made me laugh...  Any way... Did you know, customize charaters requires you to pay real money? It makes me think of Destiny... DLC after DLC after DLC = $ It not a bad game. For a old computer. My gaming computer seeks for something else though. Thanks for the trial though.
5355	0	a	Cancer
2137	1	a	This is the cheapest coffee, And it cant be finished, Didn't sleep for 2 days,yes 2 days straight. Dinosaurs + Jetpacks + Mechs+ FPS + TPS game. 12/10
1899	0	a	Looks like a flash-game from 2005.
5094	0	a	This game is really not that well developed. The graphics are very good but the game is not optimized well at all. I only get about 50-60 fps on max settings with a gtx 760. I can run more demanding games past 100 fps. Also not to mention th animations for the dino's are very cheap looking and in all I really wouldn't reccomend this game. The servers are not hosted by the game developers which means someone will be hosting the game through their internet so if they lag the whole game does and almost every game I joined everybodys ping was through the roof.
5184	0	a	Ewww...  While this Game may look like fun on first sight it has some serious flaws.  It runs on Unreal Engine 3 utilising Direct3D9 as it's API and is just on default not utilising Hardware Great which only gets strengthened by 3rdparty developers(T-REK 'Industries?') not having heard of Texture Porting and proper VRAM allocation , speaking of the game not even trying to really using those juicy amounts of Virtual Ram your Dedicated GPU has. yea those 4/8 GB lying idle while your frames Keep dipping is how a game is ment to be played.  Second Concern . As above already the game is already not doing too well regarding performance right out of the bat , want to hear a bigger joke. the choice of closed source PhysX as Physics Engine by a 3rdParty Company which already struggles with making peoples hardware work in their game.  Mediocre choice of Graphic options : Oh boy . yea as you launch it you'll find yourself in the Menu with . uhm pardon . A few Options to change. Such as Textures , 'FX Quality'.. the usual.  what it doesn't give you is anything you'd want .: Sound Quality? , cap your FPS at anything else than your monitors refresh rate , half of it or uncapped. set custom Qualitys for Anything included in any setting. Bloodsplatsize, WeatherFX threshold , decal quality , disable Weather FX , lightning , shadowmapsize and so on.   I think as far as this goes we're done with how well the game is ment to be played. pun intended.  Gameplaytime bois.  -Static weaponmodels. -Stiff Animations. -Imported Gametextures are lowresolution and high on performanceloss. -The Charactersounds seem to be recorded in a bathtub with the cheapest ebay mic and directly put into SV and rendered into 192kb/s. -Ai (to be fair even making a semi adequate one is really hard) is outright stupid , gets stuck in defaulted maps which i would ignore if not for the fact that they're made in a fixed loadout and not fully RNG and has weird hitboxes. -Maps are buggy , you can jump seemingly out of bounds , get stuck in random spots , reach spots where you're invisible to the ai , Flat Design , poor detail , and is one large map rendered on launch which explains the poor fps on some machines( Conquest). -Characters and lines are plain and boring , while fun at first you'll get bored of it after a few hours. and maybe annoyed by it after a while longer.  I do not recommend the purchase , it might be fun for an evening or two but it just fails to offer replayablity. in addition to that it runs like Crysis on a post Millenium PC. ( Having no PhysX hardware support that is.) 
3742	1	a	Want Call Of Duty with a prehistoric twist? Want Jurassic Park with Team Fortress 2? Then get this game: seriously, get it now! It's awesome, has a tonne of awesome weapons and unlocks, there are 10 playable dinosaurs, and the last major update is AWESOME!!! A definite 1000000/10.
1634	0	a	It has Charm, but thats all it has going for it, in my opinion. It seems to me like a watered down Mario, which I didn't believe was possible to this point. The Music is repetitive which puts you off and the Charm runs off after the first few levels. 
3797	0	a	Absolute Crap, no wonder it was on sale
4415	0	a	Not working with Linux (Ubuntu) ?
5803	0	a	fun, but could be alot better
2024	0	a	The biggest challenge are the controls, as they are pretty bad. I do recommend this game if you are about 6 year old, though.
4760	1	a	This game rox
1855	1	a	interesting physics. I'm a man of small words because as you may have seen in other game reviews, people write extremely long reviews and I just don't understand and people will definitely say that I am off topic which I am just to make this review really long just as a joke because I am talking about really long reviews for games and I can't even think what to say next which makes me sad because people will say that this review is too short so I wil end it here.
6455	1	a	It's one dollar......that is it.......
3121	1	a	Thsi gaem is fun if your a meme HA PRANKED!!! 4 heil hitlers outta 5 heil hitlers it was one helluva schnitzel
231	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
5078	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
1999	1	a	Yes... Yes and More Yes.. BEEP is a highly addictive game with elements from your favourite games from yesteryear. A brilliant example of creativity and superb game play. I was hooked from the first level and already will recommend this to everyone.
1069	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game that takes the point of view behind the actor to be apart of the mayhem. With the rise in popularity in such games in the console market, Orcs Must Die! is a nice addition that brings some new gameplay mechanics to the genre to keep it fresh. Itâs fierce, fast paced, and thereâs nothing better than killing orcs. Man, orcs are stupid.   http://iamericm.com/2014/04/orcs-must-die-indie-game-review/ 
4344	1	a	Good game!! worth Money!! (1$)
3375	1	a	You wake up, drenched in sweat. 'That same dream again?' Asks your wife, you glance back and your wife is now an oviraptor. You scream and nothing but bullets come out of your gaping mouth, the words appear on your wall, written in blood. 'ORION: Dino Horde'. You scream the words 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUY THIS GAME' (5/5)
6032	1	a	This game needs better video settings for low-end pcs aswell as better guns to start of with instead of pistols...
3141	1	a	Way more fun than I thought it was going to be. Playing this with some friends is a total blast. I see myself playing this for a very long time and I won't regret a damn thing.
555	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a critically acclaimed mix between acion adventure and tower defense. The game has some beautiful artwork, a vast amount of weapons and traps, and most importantly a band of lovable over the top characters. Although it is a large amount of fun to play I will say that not once on my playthrough did I think 'Wow I've never seen anything like this before' and that ends up being a fatal flaw of the game, however that does not make it a bad game. If you're in the mood for a lovable and charismatic adventure similar in spirit to a game like Borderlands then look no further. I would give Orcs Must Die a solid 7/10
4648	1	a	IT LAGS LIKE CRAZY BUT THE CONCEPT IS REALY COOL SO PLAY THE GAME AND SUPPORT THE DEVS
2145	1	a	The best get stuck in a rock simulator.
1138	1	a	So much fun. Wish I could have more orcs and more money.

4696	0	a	the trailer made this game look like it was going to be a spinoff of ARK: Survival Evolved... but it turned out to be an arena game. At least it was only 50 cents! 
636	1	a	Mega funny game to burn hours of time into, highly reccommended!
2491	0	a	this game is a waste of time dont even bother to be honest there are better free to plays
2674	1	a	The first game I play where the butt of a gun hurts more than the gun itself.
3149	1	a	Stabbed a pterodactyl  10/10
4076	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
1510	0	a	My video review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HolQMp6q6A8 
6201	1	a	Don't let the mediocre graphics and dated Unreal Engine put you off of this game; with a few beers and some friends, this game is actually pretty fun! A cross between Turok and Halo, giggle your way through multiplayer survival mode as you lay waste to hordes of Raptors, Triceratops, T-Rexes and other baddies with an arsenal of machine gunes, pistols, flamethrowers, and tanks! Replayability may be lacking, so try and pick this one up for sub $2.00 prices.
3739	0	a	Peter the Pterodactyl killed my friend
4300	1	a	It's like playing Left 4 Dead but with dinosaurs that are also mentally challenged. Also you're mentally challenged. And the big dinosaurs are especially mentally challenged and op 8.75623/5 stars
5777	1	a	Grinding on a T-Rex back while shootaring other mighty dinos in da face with my epic 'kill-all-these-mighty-dinos-gun', awesome stuff!  would recommend, 2/1!
2528	1	a	As a jurrasic park survivor, it's really touching to get the oppurtunity to get back at those pesky dinos for almost klling me and my family. For any one like me who had to go through that tragic events of jurrasic park it is a must have.

5638	0	a	paid for this game now its free nothing special for what i paid nothing at all while every one els gets it free devs suck lol
4091	1	a	More fun than porridge. Also dinosaurs.
6197	1	a	oh this one is fun!! DIE DINO SKUM!!!!!
187	1	a	It's the sorely needed missing link between Tecmo's Deception and mainstream appeal. No satan worshipping, though :/
3995	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs. This fulfills my childhood Jurassic Park fantasies. 12/10
5495	0	a	Couldn't play properly don't have the pc best pc but should run well however it is so Laggy I can't tell what is going on going to try and get a refund not what I expected
3508	1	a	This game doesn't deserve as bad a meta-score as it has been given. I can honestly say, I was happy to purchase five copies. And everyone I know who took a chance and bought this game on a whim have all been excitedly surprised and have maybe even had as much fun as I have. The survival (which is all I can speak for) game-mode is really satisfying and definitely scratches that itch the original 'Zombies' console shooter infected me with. As far as I'm concerned, all the other game modes are just extra fun icing on a really yummy dino-blasted cake. If you were expecting Halo6Doom128 with the super epic plot twist bulletquicktime minigames...please resume playing the other shooters. But if you wanna try somethin' a little different and you enjoy shooter games that have 'vending machines' and waves of enemies to eliminate give Orion:Dino Horde a try, you'll probably really have fun with it if you give it a real chance.
2391	1	a	Its a buggy, awful mess with little polish, but a lot of heart put in to it. But its amazing. At first you laugh at the badness of it, but it becomes irrelivant as you find yourself having fun at killing large amounts of dino's in this crazy chaotic FPS.  Its an awful fun game, I recommend you get the 4pack and play it with friends for some stupid fun.
5095	1	a	Wow 'Worst Game Ever' to 'Wow i love this game!' I totaly love this it is amazing!
4728	1	a	Pay .99USD and then 2 weeks latter its free
2646	1	a	This game is actually really cool, like I spent $1 on it like 'pfft whatever, can't really lose at that price' and it turned out to be remarkably fun. I'm not sure what this game did or what state it was in on release but it's certainly much better now, has a huge Planetside 2 feel to it on a smaller scale but with freaking dinosaurs!  Planetpart, Jurrasicside, take your pick.
1262	1	a	This game is great!!!
403	1	a	Fun trap/tower defense type game Fast paced, easy controls, funny and engaging story line, without feeling too heavy. A great game to sit down and waste time playing and having fun, without having to make those long term commitments, and planning out your future needs for characters etc.
643	1	a	Really enjoyed it. Incredibly addcitive. Its nice to see that the ex-ensemble guys are still doing good work. If you like third person action or tower defense you should pick it up. its only 15 bucks. totally worth the buy.
1305	1	a	The same as Shank 1: cubic tons of blood, cartoon characters, more violence than in the Venezuelan newspaper, short but with enough replay value, etc. Virtually nothing was improved, and feels more like an expansion, but if you liked the first one, I did, go for it
4943	1	a	Pretty fun game if you like facing off against waves of enemies.
3643	1	a	Imagine if someone made a fantastic game that was a fusion of Jurassic Park, Halo, and Planetside 2.   This is not that game.  This will never be that game. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥. That being said, it's very fun with friends.
3232	1	a	First review so bear with me guys. ;_; So, I was gifted this from a friend and we decided to play together for a little while during one evening. Needless to say, I had a blast from the short amount of time that I played it. Once I have some more free time at a later date, I will definitely play this game again! I loved playing with other people in an attempt to wreck some dinosaurs and stuff... Aaaand to get wrecked by the dinosaurs themselves at times. Worth the buy for sure.
3034	1	a	Great Game, Countless Hours of fun, only game i could fight a giant crocodile with a mech :)
2363	1	a	this game is so good. i have a great time using the battlefield 4 guns. the graphics are better then real life view. there is a few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ places like riding the T-Rex.  i enjoyed the most to replace the guns! once in a life time experience
2692	1	a	I have been playing this game for a couple of hours now and I've got to say, this is probably one of the best dinosaur survival games that I have ever seen! The gameplay is so smooth and the graphics are amazing! The action in this game is unreal and you're always up to the task of finishing the objective. The only thing that bugs me are the pterodactyl's, they're always flying at you picking off your health, but the only way to stop them is with a shotgun! I recommend this game for everyone to play if you like a dinosaur survival, open-world, action, and multiplayer/solo experience!
2020	1	a	great game
5655	0	a	Yes and No. After of 1 hour you will get bored 5/10 if you want buy
3597	0	a	I cannot put into words how painfully bad this game is.
6316	1	a	Pretty fun and well worth the price. 
3467	0	a	Junk.  Laggy, boring, ugly and (as should be obvious) very few people play.  This game has been out for 2 years, gotten several updates, and is still unbalanced and glitchy.  If you paid a buck for this, you got ripped off.  If someone gave you a copy for free, slap that person for having anything to do with this and get a real game.  Edit:  You know what? I'm not even done. I'm going to rant a bit more.  I gave this game extra time, hoping something, ANYTHING would get better. My time was wasted.  Most of the guns feel the same, aka single or burst fire, and very very weak. Depending on lag, a raptor may take up to 2 - 3 pistol clips to kill, and half to a full rifle clip to kill. The poison spitters, in addition to being able to hit you almost anywhere, shooting nonstop and leaving toxic puddles everywhere, seem to have maybe 25% to 50% of a boss dinos health (aka ridiculously hard to kill, especially early game, on easy, and considering how many spawn).  The average credits per dino is about 100, and the guns/upgrades start at about 1500 (for weak pistols) up to around 5000 for the better upgrades and guns.  And when you die? You lose it ALL.  There is a lives system that's actually more like the pickup system in Borderlands, but if you get locked in a corner where your team can't reach you and you can't get a kill (which happens quite a bit), all those extra lives basically mean nothing.  And while you do get some credits for damage done to a dino, it's going to be more like 20-30 credits if you have teammates helping.  There's not very much to say about the sound, as aside from the occasional roar, there is the non-stop, annoying TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP of you putting dozens of rounds into a single dinosaur, over, and over and over.  Oh and hey, there's a leveling system, where you do get very very minor buffs in exchange for long hours of slow grinding. 10% damage boost for my super weak pistols? Yes please! Each class has levels of it's own with almost exactly identical skills as other classes, to give you that wonderful feeling of starting from scratch for trying different characters?? Woot!  Ok, Now I'm done.
5262	0	a	i got it for free and its saying i need to buy it even if you got it free
3867	0	a	This game sucks in short. It has improved sence the last free trial but this game only live between sales on steam. The loby is broken and in total disrepair, the dino AI is crap and, the objectives are hard to find. At best this is a early bata game but not a finished product or worth $00.99.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct92YOQE3Ks 
4230	0	a	horrible game does not work do not buy it is so horrible don't buy it don't pay for it
3104	1	a	worth your money 
4801	1	a	So this game is kinda like Turok. Like it's a dinosaur hunter  But it's also a defend the base, upgrade your weapons, ect. thing. Anyway. So we had a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tank. Like full on Halo Scorpion. Like this thing was heavy. Missiles and turret and â¥â¥â¥â¥. And I was a medic so I could also heal us. And I was likewell dinos, I've got the invincible tank of death. GO MATT (my driver)! And then out of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nowhere a giant â¥â¥â¥ crocodile dinosaur pops out and we're kiting it and then a Stegosaurus rams us into him and then he hits us back into it while it's ramming us and we literally just ALL (dinos and us) fly into the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing air while spinning as the dinos hump us to death and we explode in a firework of tankitude. Laughing so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard I can't even. What the hell.  It won't win any awards and realistically speaking it's not out of beta or anything but man. Worth the $1.
1919	0	a	-no exit menu  -levels repetitive -do not buy this game  -its cheap but not worth it
653	1	a	BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
2382	1	a	You like halo?!?! You like dinorsaurs?? Than this is the game for you!!!
5447	0	a	if you review this game saying '39 cents lmao' you definitely should consider suicide because nobody above the age of twelve finds the meme funny
3455	1	a	0/10 would not buy again
6177	1	a	This is the worst game on earth but it's still the most fun you can probably have in a multiplayer game. This is not a AAA title, you get what you pay for. A 99 cent game, what's not to like?
1385	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
647	1	a	Fun in that it becomes addictive, and you get satisfaction out of getting your fix.
736	1	a	fun and hard (sometimes) and addicting game, that i can't stop playing. my type of humor too.
1560	0	a	iBomber Defense is a fun game if you really like tower defense games and if you're bored.  On the downside is that it is rather bland - I don't really have a problem with the low amount of turrets, enemies and maps (although there are quite a few maps). It's mostly how the two campaigns are very much alike, and how the quickplay is exactly like the part of the campaign you've already played. The enemies come at exact same times and in the same order, making it rather boring, and thus with a low replayability.  The music gets annoying after a while, but it's mostly the 'boom'-sounds without any other background sound that make it very obvious that this game could very easily be improved.   I would think it's worth buying for a very low price, but don't expect too much of it.
3823	1	a	This review is mainly for the multiplayer campaign, but wow. A tri-class Halo mixed with waves of dinosaurs! You must defend the generator that allows you to buy new perks and weapons. As you complete each level in the game, you push forward to capture new ground; rallying points containing vehicles of different types. Here are a few highlights:  - The pterodactyls pick you up and drop you. If you haven't invested in a parachute, you fall to your death.  - You may drive a tank, a hoverplane, or multiple other vehicles as you capture new rallying points.  - You may be targeted and charged by a triceratops.  - You may be eaten by a T-Rex, a 'Spinosaurus, ' or perhaps a seuch...sucha...oversized crocodile...  - Choose to wield pistols, a main weapon, a secondary weapon, or melee. Or just use a vehicle!  Overall, I dig this game, particularly with a good group of friends.  It bugs out on 32-bit systems. Deal with it by playing in windowed mode. Why wouldn't you do that in the first place? Either way, 8/10 for the time I (and many others) spent dealing with bugs.
3637	0	a	The graphics are pretty good, and there are some cool weather effects. I also like the voice acting. Other than that, it's not very good. All you do is activate a generator and defend it against dinosaurs. Why are the dinosaurs attacking the generator anyway? This game is basically a lesser Borderlands/Halo with a Jurassic setting. I did have some fun playing it with my friend, but I can't see myself going back to it.
4983	0	a	I died of a brain tumor playing this game. Support my ghost by not playing this game.
4330	0	a	This game would be amazing if I could actually start it up. All my friends love the game, they bought it for me... I can't even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play it. Fix your game please. I did everything this is the 5th hour I've tried to get this thing working. Please fix it. Steam support doesnt help me at all, someone please help me.
1357	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
6333	1	a	You can meet T-Rex
2699	1	a	You kill dinosours with guns 8 out of 10
4556	1	a	I LIKE IT BUT IT REQUIRES A VERY GOOD COMPUTER TO PLAY..
1885	0	a	why..... just why
5003	1	a	This game lacks polish, support and a good PvP multiplayer. However, i think it has very strong coop/singleplayer gamemodes, most notably Survival and Conquest. These two modes (even with all the mentioned issues) are entertaining enough to keep me playing. There are vehicles, epic guns and battles on big maps with changing weather and time of day. The difficulty can vary from really easy to extremely hard, so there will always be a challenge. The game has so much potential, yet it is wasted by the developers, but I still like it.  The game provides a great PvE experience. I recommend the game for people who prefer PvE and don't mind minor bugs. 8/10
4767	1	a	Good Waist of time, and money...
4156	0	a	Runs poorly for the size of the maps and the graphics.
4145	0	a	This game is like the last guy to be killed by Kony before everyone stopped giving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about him. Forgotten....
3520	0	a	6/10
2712	0	a	Cool concept, Poorly executed.
2295	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was ninety nine cents.
3751	0	a	This game is so confusingly bad, I honestly cannot tell if it's intended to be shovelware or simply a product of poor production.
541	1	a	Awesome tower defence game. lots of fun and very original.
2928	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game for every dinosaur lover, star wars fan, jurassic park fan or a Halo fan. I recommend it to everyone of those people from the list above! My rating for this game is 10/10. Keep up the good work!
3817	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs
6147	0	a	Very laggy, wasn't able to do anything. I had just the game open and it glitched and lagged so bad. I felt like I was on DSL again. The graphics are nice, but it isn't worth the lag. I give it a one out of 5 stars, graphics are nice. Only good thing about tha game to be honest.
1380	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
6128	1	a	Truely, with a dollar, you can't buy many things. A candy bar at most, but this game is truly worth a dollar if you got one, especially if you have some friends to play it with you.
6406	1	a	This is one of the best games i ever played 11/10
5007	1	a	ORION Dino Hord is a firstperson shooter/survivel game.You need to protect a genarotor while surviving you gest it hordes and hordes of dinosaurs. The way you look is like halo and you acn bye cooler armor to make your person look better. in all this game is a 7/10 and maby not worth evry peni but a good game!
571	1	a	A frighteningly addictive game with a real sense of humour, the DLC is a sharp learning curve but the whole game is masses of fun
3845	1	a	In many ways the spiritual successor to half-life 2 and most fun I've had in a game since fallout 3.  11/10 'it was decent'
233	1	a	It was alright
4375	1	a	its an amazing game for its price the grapics are good i would recomend anyone getting it
858	1	a	A nice little break from Skyrim
2560	1	a	Awesome game for the price!.
699	1	a	This is the perfect game to just start blasting away at every once in a while. Don't expect to get caught up in it for more than a few days, but while you do, it's great. Plain old orc-blasting ogre-hacking fun. Classic hack n' slash that's simply good at what it does.
1070	1	a	Hilarious game pretty much the best part is what the guy is saying. He keeps the mood light so I'm not gnashing my teeth on those hard levels. Buy if you're into FPTower defense things
2199	1	a	 I'd buy that for a Dollar!
155	1	a	How does a TD (tower defense) sound combined with a third person shooter? combine it with crazy enemies and you've got Orcs Must Die! This game and its second version have small differences like the enchanters(or whatever they called themselves) OMD2 is more polished and has multiplayer but isn't as good for 1 person so get this if you have no real friends(like me)   If you're interested look up some gameplay videos on youtube :D
4064	0	a	I tried this game on a free week. It always attracted me because of the nice screenshots and the coop mode, but because of the previous failure from this developer, I always retained myself from purchasing it. I'm also an indie lover, and I can bear with bugs and underdevelopment if the game is actually good and fun, and this one looked like one such case from the conflicting comments of the players.  The reality is this game is not actually fun, but funny. I laughed so much when I played it, because if you can do anything wrong when making a game, you'll find it here. Even the graphics, that looked like the only thing that was made good, looks so weird because of the bad animations (or lack of in some case).  The gameplay is a lagfest, even with a low ping, and amazingly it also affects animations, that will lag aswell, making it look like an old cartoon, when animations were made with just 3 drawings repeated forever.  Nothing is fun here. The shooting, the driving, the walking around for miles to catch up with teammates, the lag, the animations, the gameplay.  Seriously, this game has potential, but looks like a v0.2 of an ongoing free project made by an amateur team. And, for now, even at 91% off for 0.99 euro is not worth the time spent purchasing, downloading, configuring and playing it.  Go buy a bundle with those money. The worst it could happen is you'll get five bad games instead of just one.
644	1	a	Def a game I would recommend getting if you like RTS.
339	1	a	Okay, so how come it starts off easy, then suddenly a few levels in, BLAM, I can't get through it?? All the previous levels took me one go, then I get hit by a level I cannot pass. I am NOT going to YouTube for a solution. That is dumb. That is for Candy Crush Saga. Frustrating, and I should blame myself. But I won't, I blame the developers. Anyway, if you like tower defense games, this is one. But up close in 3D.
4820	1	a	Somehow a game so cheap can be so fun. 100/10 IGN
1235	1	a	Fun new take on TD games.
2964	1	a	I bought 4 pack of this game with 39 cents. I'd pay more for the fun me and my friends have. Excelent
861	1	a	Alright, I gotta admit, there's a perverse sort of classic Tom &amp; Jerry fun to be had with this game and I have had quite a bit of that fun with this game. Not the best 'action tower defense' game mind (it's dying for a co-op mode), but it's twists in the formula are lotsa fun.
1473	1	a	Love this game
2997	1	a	'This game feels like the hand of the lord has stroked my genitalia.'
5913	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun game, with friends or with the bots. Sure there are more problems with the game than I would wish, but for $0.99 there isn't anything to complain about.
3721	0	a	Constant problems with server connection, ingame user interface was poor/poor game play. Did not feel like a complete game
678	1	a	Gotta love mass genocide! Set the language to German to get the full experience.
4526	0	a	Play it only with friends.
4984	1	a	The Metascore is really bad, but the game is so amazing its like halo but with dinosaurs ! Who wouldn't want that?
6184	1	a	I bought this game when it was a dollar because I was poor. I would buy it again now even though I am still poor. I enjoy Rampage mode, because you can run around as a spinosaurus and chomp players and/or raptors. Plus in survival mode you can get the Cryoknife a weapon that alows you to slice your way through the hordes and hordes of dinos. I enjoy jumping onto the backs of large dinos and slicing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them. I only see one con, alot of the mapps appear to be the same map, just decorated differently with elevation changes. Overall it is very fun!
1796	1	a	I have to say, I am impressed. I bought this thinking 'cheap little platformer' and got a wee bit more than I bargained for. Those that know me know I do not give easy recomendations. But, for the couple of dollars I spent, I have well gottom my moneys worth so far. Decent artwork, fun content, lots of levels. And thus far, fairly good levels to boot. I'm not sayig Beep os the Mari... must not use trademarked name... of the robot world. but it's been a lot of fun thus far. I'll let you know if that changes. 8)
4464	0	a	  A masterpiece that revolutionises the gaming industry. Truly a spectacle to behold. The best game in my library without a doubt. Worth every cent.
4185	0	a	This is the worst game ever created all things considered. If a free Android game is bad, you don't really care because your expectations were so low to begin with. When a Dino game is this bad, it can be considered to be near the top of the list of worst games of all time. With the budget and the supposed good reviews this game received, David Prassel should be sued with a major class action lawsuit of everyone conned into buying this game. The graphics are terrible, the dinos were mindless, and the multiplayer is idiotic. There is no strategy, the maps are way too open and large for nerds to play. With the jetpacks your game becomes broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  9.9/10 ~ IGN legit reviewer
932	1	a	It's strangely addicting to set up diabolical traps for hundreds of orcs to meet their collective doom.
3183	1	a	Couldn't resist for less than a dollar. Downloaded. Logged on to server. Shot a tiny dinosaur in the face with my pistol. Picked up and carried into the atmosphere by a pterodactyl. Plummeted to my death. 10/10 would forget parachute again
3552	1	a	the trexes are almost impossible to kill 
668	1	a	This game's a blast. Overall, it's more of a 'management' type of game rather than ur basic hack-n-slash. Bonus are the little funny comments from the orcs whenever they start attacking. Even for an old game, it's still fun.
1716	1	a	Wall E meets super mario!! Game is amazing and for 0.19 cents you will def get your moneys worth!  Pros Scenery  Physics  puzzles soundtracks/ effects difficualty  Checkpoints  Cons
4825	1	a	Essentially, this game feels like Halo with dinosaurs and funny hats. And it's great!  Even by the time of writing this, I've not played much of it but I've already found it fun to play in. For the money you pay, the game is more than worth it. It's suprisingly solid for such a cheap game - the graphics are good, it has inclement weather and day-night cycles, there are pretty large maps, the AI work decently. It can also be pretty challenging in solo mode, plus it has multiplayer and co-op, so it can be fun for groups to play as well.  It's a well made game, albeit with a few bugs, but for the price you pay, why the hell not?  12/10 would dinosaur
189	1	a	Do yourself a favour and get the frickin game!!!!!
219	1	a	It was alright
5199	1	a	This game is really cheap will be one of the greatest/funniest experiences for you if you have a friend with you on call, and just play for fun, the mechanics are ridiculously funny when you're in a good mood.  Play this game with a friend, preferably on call, that makes this the most fun.
414	1	a	Great game. Bought on steam sale so it was certainly a bargain. The keyboard can be rebound using a custom cfg - search online for directions.
2696	1	a	Pretty dank, fun time waster
6341	1	a	You get to punch a T-rex in the face. A T-REX. IN THE FACE. That's like all my childhood desires rolled into one ridiculously enjoyable, electronic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5336	0	a	A buggy mess of a halo ripoff that dosen't understand what it wants to be
6481	1	a	good game, good game ... for $1 ... It's not broken as old videos show and it was fun to play it for 15 minutes, gna play it later
6382	1	a	Not even one minute played 11/10
1761	1	a	Awesome game, is a cool and nice game, I love it.
2614	1	a	played when it was free weekend i remeber it was fun im actuly planing on buying it this summer
6436	1	a	This is Halo vehicles, base defense, RPG elements per game (augments and upgrades), Counterstrike (buy weapons every round), battlefield (revive teammates), all in a fast Unreal Tournament engine. Essentially, take the best aspects of any FPS you've ever played, and you've got this.  I don't personally care about the dinosaurs, I'd be fine with some kind of imagined alien. However, the dino aspect fits the setting, which is well done, and it is moe than a little hilarious. I love it!
3267	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
3955	1	a	Amazing amount of fun for the steam sale price, why did this game get only a 36 on MC?
4162	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
4394	1	a	This game is VERY FUN! I would highly recommend it! 8/10
2350	1	a	It's Halo with Dinosaurs
4996	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
6066	0	a	it looks like it could be a fun game but the dino controls are kinda really bad
5574	1	a	It's gud
4341	1	a	Perfect
2632	1	a	Its a fun game but man could the frames be better
795	1	a	Great tower defense style of game with a large variety of traps to get you through the levels. Having a third person character to aid your traps adds to the fun.
6054	1	a	Really dumb fun akin to Killing Floor with a dinosaur flavor. Actually a very rewarding experience with friends.
6373	1	a	it is one of the best games ever
2346	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
5492	0	a	this game gave me both testicular and breast cancer.
1227	1	a	ÐÐ»Ð°ÑÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÑÑÐ°.   Awesome tower defense game. Strict but fun balance. Lots of traps weapons and spells. Highly recommend it.
268	1	a	I am an avid FPS gamer, and despite my tendency to skimp on other genres, I have to say, this game is excellent! Great for killing time. Lots of colours and goofy traps.   It doesn't however feature a coop mode, but fortunately that was introduced in OMD2.  A solid package all around :)
2390	1	a	It's like Halo, but with dinosaurs
4216	0	a	waste of time and money.
6356	1	a	Bloody amazing game for 99 cents or less. It is an indie dino-shooter which is lots of fun and is sure to last! By the way, melee is OP!
1724	1	a	I didn't expect to like this game. The graphics looked too simplistic, and I mistook it for a half-baked effort. It isn't.  If you've ever liked platform games that ask you to stop and think up your movement beforehand rather than have lightning reflexes, you are probably going to like this game. It is a light-hearted puzzle platformer,  There is not much frustration to be had, at least up until the part I've reached so far. You casually bounce around platforms, collecting thingies and shooting badies. When they either kill you, or you fall to your death, you respawn on one of the rather frequent checkpoints. You have infinite lives as far as I can discern, so no pressure there either.  I've said that on the review of another game too: I'm in a phase in my life that sometimes I just need to squeeze a stress ball to unwind from my day, I need my off time to be relaxing, not stressful. Taking gaming way too seriously is in the past for me. This game suits me just fine. It's one of the anti-stress squeeze balls of gaming. If this sounds like something you'd like, give it a try.
1169	1	a	FANTASTIC, simple, tower defense game. Upgrading your tools/traps leads you to replay levels and dominate the levels more efficiently to get better ratings for more upgrades. It's an addicting formula with a great sense of humor mixed with gratuitous violence. If only there were more levels out there..
842	1	a	Orcs, Orcs, Orcs and did I mention there are orcs ? This game is all about orcs! You are the last defender of the magic in your world, but you are kinda stupid and not very good at your job! So jump right into the action and kill orcs, orcs and orcs (sometimes a few oger)
1347	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10
4327	0	a	Screaming 'Team mate down!' is more fun than actually playing this game. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ in short. Dino chasing you? â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cloak. Bam. You're invincible. There's nothing fun about it. The slow motion is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the dino ai is atrocious. I'm glad I only installed this for free week. There's also some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 'spooky christmas' map or some â¥â¥â¥â¥. There's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ghosts and robo reindeers with lasers. Only buy it if you won't miss a dollar and have friends that have a sense of humour. Like no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke it's hilarious how bad this game is.
5182	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.
5241	0	a	Itisbad but fun sometimes
2506	1	a	Orion: dino horde is great for those cold winter days when you need to light a wood stove with your computer. 10/10
5694	0	a	this game is absolute trash i bought it on sale for 49 cents and i feel it wasnt even worth that save your money guys dont buy this theres ftp games better than this
4736	0	a	One playthrough of 4 minutes and I've already been annoyed by buggy â¥â¥â¥ bots, buggy â¥â¥â¥ enemys and poor excuses for maps. I can handle the severely outdated graphics from a half life 1 engine but god damn this isn't fun.   Halloween Map titled 'Hell' is poorly recycled, with ear â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sound effects and music in the startingbase. The map consisted of poorly reused flaming pumpkins littered everywhere. The only game changing feature being a incredibly unfair and seriously stupid looking pumpkin boss. This boss however made the game really frustrated by downing our poorly organised squad in the matter of seconds. Reminder that this all happened barely 4 minutes into our experience of the game and im already sick of this game.  Bad game 3/10
5190	0	a	Wasnt expecting waves of dinosaurs but more of a dinosaur survival game. Not a bad game just not what I wanted or expected.
4766	1	a	Fun for a few hours with your friends, and is incredibly cheap, so I'd buy it just to play for one afternoon
3710	0	a	Buy Primal Carnage instead.
4114	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
3707	0	a	I would like to start my review, with the utmost important point i'm trying to make here:  It's not worth your money, not even one euro ! Aah do not let yourself get fooled by their enticing videos in which the metascore is told to be a lie,  for this metascore is very much correct.   Let me now continue with disecting this horrible game, as one would do with a dead frog (very respectlessy and relentess). This is best chewed-out, overhyped (i dare say if you only glare once, on the videos provided in the store), piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can buy with money.  The models are truly horrible, quake live has more detailed models, than this game. The dinosuars are really stiff and inanimate, they appear the be dead before you shoot them. Never in my life have i seen such pixelate artwork being used in a game, for instance the loadout screen in which you select what class you want to play, it's so pixalated i would dare to say it's resolution is 256*256 and no more. Also the matchmaking system is realy buggy to say the least, also in the 20 minutes or less that i 've tried this game i couldn't play with my friend since this game wouldn't allow us, the lobby screen is so underdeveloped it's laughable.  But hey if you want some braindead dino killing action without even taking the slightest notice of the actaul game and the playability of it, this game may be very much for you.  Probably all these things added up makes the price 1 euro and no more, money spent on a bread is better spent money. If you are thinking to buy this game you might aswell donate one euro (or whatever currency you may use) to a charity.  Please do so for the sake of humanity.  After paying for this game, i felt so much shame that i was disgusting and thus as a result of it i automatically was inclined to donate a euro to a charity. as if it were to pay of for the sin that i had commited by buying this.  Do not bego the same mistake as i did. For your humanity ! 
3400	1	a	This has to be one of my favourite games ever. yeah its a bit buggy so who cares. the graphics are not the greatest so what. the game is difficult who cares. You get to mow down the cast of jurassic park. i could make a whole list on why i would recommend this game but i don't really have to play the game and youll see why i think this is a great game
2757	1	a	It's okay, considering that I can buy a Coke for more than I bought this game for.
4013	1	a	Shooting Dino's and â¥â¥â¥â¥. Hell why not.
6269	1	a	Worth every penny! Because it's only 99 cents. Get it. It is a fun time-wasting game with interesting mechanics.
974	1	a	It is like dungeon defenders if you played it, but yuo are alone, there is more fun and there isn't the multiplayer.  7/10
6161	1	a	I don't own this game so I am giving it a thumbs up for letting me review it without having bought it.
3041	1	a	i wish i had this game 
93	1	a	It's like solitaire, except... Oh. Wait. No. Yeah. It's like solitaire. Wait forever for the cards you need to appear to finish one of multiple straight flushes you set up to win the game.
5432	0	a	Not even worth the download on a free week. They somehow cloned Halo with dinosaurs but yet still managed to make it suck somehow.  It's almost not even possible to do and yet somehow Spiral managed to screw up the marriage of Halo and Dinosaurs even worse than the way 800 North screwed up Nazi's and Dinosaurs.(Dino-D-Day)  So now begs the question......will Dinosaurs ever kick â¥â¥â¥ in video games ever again?
2077	1	a	You can fight a T-Rex in a mech. That's all you should need to know, unless you live a small, sad existence.  (like the sort of person who makes daily comments on the same Steam review)
5208	0	a	It's terrible :/
2746	1	a	A friend gifted me this game, i played it once. game crashed twice and lagged the hell out of my game. I swear I had like 4 FPS. I don't have a bad computer, and i rarely have a problem with this type of thing. Dinosour haelo is fun. 
4210	0	a	Awful textures from 1998, hideous color schemes, poor draw distance, ugly menus, the worst sound design and weakest musical score you will ever hear in a game. Ever. This game is bad and a major waste of your money.
344	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
2101	0	a	  Weapons seem pretty weak . I guess its not my cup of tea . The concept is good but it laggs for me most of the time.   Fast paced gameplay , and much spray and pray . however the lagg-spikes make it really hard for me to play :/
1800	1	a	I bought this game for my friend as a troll, when he kept asking me for GTA V. I bought it for myself to mock him, and I've come to actually enjoy this game. After that, I bought my friend GTA V, but we are still playing this game.
1862	1	a	Really entertaining!
781	1	a	Ostensibly a Tower Defense game, Orcs Must Die is a downright fantastic take on the genre. With an art style reminiscent of Torchlight and a light-hearted sense of humour revolving around all the myriad ways to kill Orcs, OMD is as fun to watch and listen to as it is to play. The game offers a lot of options, and it does a good job of making them all viable. You can be just as effective using traps to decimate Orcs as you can be wading in with Crossbow and Bladestaff. You can use traps to deal direct damage, or take advantage of physics and fling the Orcs around like ragdolls. You can also opt to be a weapon-wielder, lopping heads and shooting faces, or you can load up with spells and lay all kinds of elemental smackdown. Or any combination of the above.   Orcs Must Die is an aesthetically pleasing game that transcends its origins and does not disappoint in living up to its namesake. This game is excellent.
3101	1	a	I paid $.99 for this game and look how many hours I have on record. Need I say more?
458	1	a	Brilliant game - really addictive!!! :)
3061	1	a	This is a game that if a bigger budget was available, it would be amazing! As it stands, it is good. Fun Co-op or Single Player. Great weapons, good dinosaur combat and plenty of ways to customise your map variables (dinosaur health/damage, timers, vehicles, oddly funny extra dinosaur waves). I've been playing since Orion: Dino Horde and I enjoyed that game too. Sure it has bugs and some issues and not amazing visuals compared with $40 Million dollar games, yet it is surprising replayable and trying to get even more XP the next game by using Melee is great! Punch a T-Rex in the head! There are not that many 'Survival' levels which is what I mainly play but still good solid fun. And won't cost much at all! Recommended!
392	0	a	Tedious garbage. I could have eaten at Arby's and been laid up with food poisoning for a week, and still have had a better time than I have with the time and money I have invested in this. I don't want a refund, I wish I had never played it.
2192	1	a	Its good fun with a team of freinds and its only 1 euro.  Lots of different modes, maps and weapons and lets not forget the dinos, they are great.
1867	1	a	Wall-E on steroids
5223	1	a	Omg,i purchased the 4 pack ,truely a gud fricking game.the price tag is low,very fun and allot of gameplay to be had plus i got 3 other copies that i can give to my friends ,or trade with it for another game,the best bargain i have ever seen!
3858	1	a	This game ruined my life and love of video games 0/10 would play again.
2803	1	a	Its a fun game and totally worth $1 i say get it and just enjoy the fruits
2579	1	a	Good game, people naturally knew what needed to be done. Not a single word said and you got a driver with a gunner.
803	1	a	This game is incredibley fun if you love seting up your on personal sen's funhouse and killing orcs like its an average day at the office. So have fun commiting genicide.
13	1	a	Its almost worth $10 just for the kung fu music mixer on the title screen that you unlock as you beat the game. It is a bit lacking with the multiplayer down and it's disappointing the main menu still lists features as 'coming soon' after ten years. But still a pretty nice title for the price.
5375	1	a	I would tell you to play this game but in the end it doesnt even matter..... 5/10
1660	0	a	I don't get this game... seriously. Why isn't there a proper tutorial ? I get the idea of moving to higher levels, and the fact that the higher you get the more enemies appear. But what do the power-ups mean ? How do I change weapons ? Can I even change weapons ? What's the best tactic ? How do I change an enemy from the inside ? And so on and so forth. This would've been a better game if things like that were explained properly. Also, the stylish retro graphics do make up for some of the game, but it just isn't enough. Let's hope the developer fixes some of my complaints in the near future.  [Rating: 66/100]
3805	0	a	this is no game 
2501	0	a	It is rare I'm able to say this, but this is even overpriced at $1..
5996	0	a	This game is pretty boring and has bad graphics, If it hadnt have been free to test, I wouldnt have played it... Im glad i didnt buy it.
2523	1	a	Bad. Play it and see how bad it is. Bad.
1893	1	a	I just want card drops.
4799	1	a	I think it really is worth more than its cost. Good game
385	0	a	Definitely not one I'll play very often; but then I'm more about startegy &amp; tactics than brute force.
685	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played
5824	1	a	gotta pewpew those dinos
2263	1	a	When I first bought this game for 1 dollars.. I was like holy &amp;%^$ this is such rubbish game, not even worth for 1 dollar.. Never going play it again, I even wish it remove from my account.. Last night saw one big update and I thought it might my pc delete by mistake and download it again.. until i saw big news about developer change this game completely! My eyes pop out when I saw the big changes on graphic.. today i give a try.. WHAT A AMAZING GAME!!!!! Spiral Game Studios.. please read this review.. THANK U FOR LISTEN TO ALL FANS.. I going recommend this to all my friends and trying ask them to get this! 1 Dollar? I believe it shall be price more than 1 dollar because it brilliant! I just need you to fix chat log, make it more more clean and simple like others game in co-op please :)
1613	0	a	A game that would be more fun if it weren't a very blatant, very half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ iOS port (there are still 'pause' and 'jump' buttons on the interface, and the mouse does nothing for some reason, even in menus). Even the concept is funky as hell since framerate isn't steady, kind of a killer in a game where you sometimes need to 'tap' your jumps to make it to the next platform before meter runs out.  Maybe these things will be patched! Until then I recommend staying away.
4405	0	a	This game have good gameplay but you get bored preety fast and there are a few players.Don't recommand it.
4292	0	a	Characters run like they have sticks up their asses. Had no animation when firing weapons. No clue why dinosaurs are attacking energy generators. And I'm told this game has been greatly improved from what it originally was? Do yourself a favor and play something else.
3450	0	a	Not even worth the dollar I paid for it. The dinosaurs always charge straight in on you. You have 60 seconds to run halfwya across them map to restock and back again which is unecessarily short. Most of the time I have no idea what's going on or why.
1664	1	a	there are no skies in this game
531	1	a	I'm a little surprised about liking this game. Usually I'm not big on action type games, but I found myself enjoying the mix of action and strategy. Placing the traps correctly is a major part of the game, but wading into a bunch of orcs breaking thru your defenses is the icing on the cake.  I'm not far into the game yet and have found the dificulty to be hit or misss on the levels. Some seem really hard, but the next level is very easy. I can see myself finishing the game as long as the last few levels don't go over the top in difficulty.  Overall a game worth playing, especially if you catch it on sale.
1743	1	a	Excellent Platformer!!  Bought it on sale for less than 1 dollar, simple graphics but really fun  Can`t use a gamepad, only keyboard + mouse. anyway once you get use the control is excellent.  
3617	1	a	I can't stop playing this game, and neither can my friends. The game can be described as, 'Did we just play for 3 hours straight instead of studying for our final?'  'YES' 
6280	1	a	Well, this game has the look and feel of 1998. There are dinosaurs and guns...try it? Idk...
5584	0	a	Why can i write a Review for this game if i havent even played/bought it????????
4171	0	a	This game is literally cancer, whatever you do... don't even consider buying it! It first wants you to pay for it, and then pay for in game currency, just after you bought the game. Worst... P2W... game... ever!  Edit: they changed the name... again!
2602	1	a	its pretty fun for the price, nothing special but very enjoyable with friends, just buggy enough to give you a laugh without being frustrating, easy to pick up and very scalable in difficulty, from being a cakewalk at lower difficulties to being nigh impossible at higher ones  same price as a cheeseburger, you cant go wrong
2773	1	a	For $1 you would be insane not to enjoy this. After playing it, I would say it even deserves its $15 price tag. But they cant get my money back NO SIR E  But seriously, just try it with a friend. Multiplayer is a must.
1139	1	a	Orcs + Traps = Bloody Fun
1758	1	a	Great game. I'm skeptical about games with large discounts but this was worth the money and I reccomend this no matter what the cost
3236	1	a	Ay it's a good one.
6437	0	a	I tried to like it        but I really, really dont.
4685	0	a	What a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the third time.
1822	0	a	No diffrence between this and a flash game on the internet
6439	1	a	very good game i havnt had a challenge and felt like i could be over run in any second ever since i played natural selection 2 
4335	0	a	The game is okay. The developers are not.
6014	1	a	Go this when it was on sale for $0.99 and I like it. Not aa game I'll spend a long time playing but it's fun for a quick fix.
312	1	a	I've never had this much fun killing orcs!
480	1	a	If you like tower defeance games its for you protect you portal from the ugly cretures!
796	1	a	I highly reccomend if you're the sort that loves to 'turtle' playing RTS. The entire game is about making crunch points and traps so devious I giggled like a four-year-old mad genius. The dialogue is witty and goofy in a perfectly comic way, and I just love forcing them into narrow pathways and grimacing as bits of Orcs go flying everywhere.
1944	1	a	its a good game but not worth 5 bucks. buy it when its on sale for 20 cents.  10/10 would sell 4 strange weponds again
1055	1	a	This is a brutal TD, Hack n Slash game that blew my mind. Its so damn badass that you cant even imagine it! I bought it for 5 Euros (MediaMarket) plus all dlcs. It runs well and fast on my kind of old computer and its MUST BUY FOR ALL OF YOU TD, STRADEGY AND Hack n slash FANS  9.5/10
1511	0	a	PC port not so great, controls are sketchy and can be frustrating. Story is meh at best. Sad really, great premise, bad execution.
1218	1	a	This game is surprisingly clever, and a fantastic tower defense game.
2219	0	a	I got this game for free.... and I want my money back.
4535	1	a	The best game you can get for that price :)
5164	0	a	99 Cents huh? why not.... thats what i thought. ok this game might be good but my problem is that the game just doesnt work, i can have this on the lowest GFX and get 20 fps i can have this on the highset GFX and get 20 fps...do you know why? i dont. i can run games like bioshock and blackops 2 just fine bioshock at 60 on max gfx and blackops 2 at 40-50 fps med GFX. so why cant i run this game? i just want to know because this (to me) doesnt look better than blackops 2 or bioshock. and for that reason a solid NO will be in order. (its the steam summer sale go get a good game like system shock 2... i wish i had)
3506	1	a	This game doesn't deserve as bad a meta-score as it has been given. I can honestly say, I was happy to purchase five copies. And everyone I know who took a chance and bought this game on a whim have all been excitedly surprised and have maybe even had as much fun as I have. The survival (which is all I can speak for) game-mode is really satisfying and definitely scratches that itch the original 'Zombies' console shooter infected me with. As far as I'm concerned, all the other game modes are just extra fun icing on a really yummy dino-blasted cake. If you were expecting Halo6Doom128 with the super epic plot twist bulletquicktime minigames...please resume playing the other shooters. But if you wanna try somethin' a little different and you enjoy shooter games that have 'vending machines' and waves of enemies to eliminate give Orion:Dino Horde a try, you'll probably really have fun with it if you give it a real chance.
3608	0	a	free to play and didn't get anything for supporting the game, bought it for the original 15$ price tag, it was a complete waste of money
5	1	a	I can remember many drunken nights I spent enjoying the $#!+ out of this horribly demented 2d, paper-puppet, kung-fu parody, mushroom trip of a game.
4795	1	a	1$? Must be some cheap little game not worth the time. Right? No, not at ALL. This game is L4D, Killing Floor and all those other survival games with a bigger and better twist! You gain levels similar to KF but you fight not zombie, not mutants but DINOSAURS! Not just cookie cutter dinos either, each and every dino has its quirks, TRex will throw boulders at you and eat you whole. Trikes will charge you and slam the ground. Oh, and don't forget the fliers, they will pick you up and slam your face on the ground! Best 1$ I've ever spent and its gone thorugh a big upgrade since then. I would definitly throw the dollar at it, as it is literally the BEST bang for a buck.
5926	1	a	killed a tyranausaurus with a revolver 11/10
5396	1	a	Tank you so much for my refund
2695	1	a	This game is awesome co-op is done well,it reminds a lot on Halo and Borderlands  Everyone should try it  -There aren't much servers
2768	1	a	It is very funny but it is not worth 13,99â¬   But 0,99â¬ IT IS SO WORTH !  
2888	1	a	Best $0.99 I've spent on Steam 10/10 would quickscope a T-Rex again
3586	1	a	IDK if it worth $15 but what I DO know is this. As someone who hates online games, I have found my first Online Gaming Addiction. Since picking this up for a buck during one of the sales; I can't stop playing this game. I fricken LOVE it! The best way to describe it is Turok: Dinosaur Hunter... if It had wave survival/horde mode. You blast wave after wave of dinos &amp; completing objectives with insane weapons weapons and vehicles while earning money for upgrade &amp; more weapons. I know the game use to be a buggy pile of **** and the devs pulled some shady â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Metacritic early on by astroturfing its user score on Metacritic then relaunching it under a new name. That said, since then the Devs have worked their asses off fixing and improving the game and it shows. The devs may have ****ed up in the beginning but have since redeemed themselves IMO.
2829	1	a	This is a game that cost me $1. Simply the best dollar I've ever spent in my life.
74	1	a	This game was a pleasant surprise. Imagine if poker, puzzle quest, and clash of heroes were thrown into a big pot and mixed up. This would be one of the results you could get from that mixture.
1217	1	a	Amazing Bruce Campbell-esk main character? Check. Mindblowing trap combinations? Double check. Lots of Orcs? Like you have to ask...
5459	0	a	buyed this game to play with my friends in other country, but it is not possible to connect to oversea servers. and my freinds cant also not connect when i open a sever in europe. okay, it was just 1â¬â ....but a wasted â¬.
6415	1	a	Really fun game. Gameplay is a little repetetive after a while but there are lots of customisations available within the three classes, lots of weapons and upgrades within the game also.
4124	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
192	1	a	Orc's must die and Orc's must die 2 is an addictive, fast bpaced and incredibly fun game. It's easy to pick up the game play and the UI is intuitive and well made. The Graphics and color is Awesome !! The music really sets the mode and is really cool. I would recemend this game to anyone... ( 5 out of 5 stars) BO
353	1	a	8/10 - Kill a couple of Orcs, then kill more of them and repeat the cycle. Sounds boring? Tell me how it can sounds boring, because it sounds epic.
4302	1	a	STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10  The game has been updated to make it like 100 times better now.  My goodness, this game has evolved to something unbelievably good. I played it for a couple of hours three months back when I purchased the game. I didn't like it then. I uninstalled it and thought I would never play it again. Back then, the whole world looked blurred and murky. It deserved the $1.00 that it costs. But today, the evolution of this game is unbelievable. It is so so so beautiful. The gameplay is good. I just kept running randomly in my first game to appreciate the scenaries. Plus there is Steam Workshop supporty, I mean you really get a lot for the $1.00 you pay. My appeal to those that have not played this game in the past couple of months - visit the game once... you won't believe you had such a beautiful game lying in your library (probably hidden by now).  STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10
1471	1	a	A really good 2-D brawler. The 2-player 'survival mode' keeps me coming back for more.
5749	1	a	this game is soo cool i want it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
3515	0	a	THIS is a paid game..? Even for 99 cents, ist a waste money...
3542	1	a	I don't even own this game!
1062	1	a	Hate Orcs? Then this game is for you! A mixture of third person hero control, and tower placement. Hectic and insane, funny and cartoony. Orcs will hate this game.
3075	1	a	This game is one of the most captivating and enjoyable co-op games I have ever played , and what's even better is that it only costs $0.99. I would say that if you have $0.99 to spare, this is the best way to spend it. 
2763	1	a	Fun little game for very cheap at Â£1, worth buying while on sale!
6321	1	a	If your looking for a game to jiggle your Dinosaur about... This is the perfect game for you. Dedicated to those with the finest caves.
1768	1	a	awesome game my friend gave me it :D
370	0	a	That was a nice game but boring as hell. Sequel is much better.
3138	1	a	It is a serious amont of fun, join a game fly around blow up a T rex with a rocket turrent run over little dinosaurs in a car. USE A TANK !!!
71	1	a	Really fun and nice twist to the games of solitare and poker with the incorporation of a fantasy storyline.
2463	0	a	This has got to be just about the worst, overhyped games i've ever played. It's not hard, it's just stupid and boring. I would NEVER recommend this to anybody looking for a great game to play.... Go grab yourself a valve game, or a steam sale game instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
2248	1	a	The metascore is definitely something you should just ignore. The developers have really done a fantastic job and I hope that they will continue to do so. The gameplay (survival) can become boring since you're playing it over and over again but if you're playing it with your friends it can be extremely fun. With all the current features that it has e.g. gamemodes, weapons, vehicles etc. that will definitely expand in the future I recommend it.
3937	0	a	The survival gets extremely boring after 2 games of it. It ends up getting way too hard and without the weapons saving or loadouts saving its not worth the money.
2784	1	a	Lots of changes from the previous version... Keep up the good work. Looking forward to see another great updates
587	1	a	Tower defense game that's just straight up FUN.
5041	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1060	1	a	Loads of fun.
1208	1	a	What a refreshing taste of Castle Defence. If you are a Castle Defence fan, this will be an amazing experience. 5/5 for sure.
4460	0	a	Worse the 'Day One: Garry's Incident'. Although the price it one dollar, dont buy it.
2645	1	a	This game is well worth the money spent ($1), and even if it was 5 bucks i'd STILL buy it! Half descent graphics, and good game-play make this game a 7.5/10 in my opinion. I've paid alot more ($10-20) for games that weren't even HALF as good as this one! Enjoy it, and pass on the good word :)   Respectfully, Cronic
243	1	a	Really fun game, reminds me of the days of dungeon keeper and setting up traps for the invasion of the good guys, Well in orcs must die, you are the good guys, doing it the other way round, setting traps for the bad guys.   Great game to play, can't recommend enough.
2603	1	a	It's a game featuring cyber-soldiers with jet-packs, shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, cloaking devices, and a bunch of other weapons and gear against waves upon waves of dinosaurs. And it costs one dollar. There's no reason not to buy it and spend at least an hour or two messing around in this game. Also, rocket launchers and jet-packs are OP.
3778	1	a	Best Developers ever! Game can't fail, only developers can! 11/10, best game for only 0,5 - 1$
6009	1	a	It is what it says it is; You, Bullets, Robots, Dinos
2546	1	a	After being disappointed by a few other games claiming to offer a fun time kicking dinosaur butt, I was reluctant to buy this, even at the ridiculous sale price of 1.49. After a friend recommended it, I found to be a great shooter with a nice arcadey feel that not only features great human vs. dino combat, but also fulfilling human deathmatch modes. That being said, I strongly recommend this game to be played with friends. Help get this underrated FPS to where it deserves to be.
1121	1	a	Very fun tower defense / action mix! Even for people less enthusiastic about the genre. Very satisfying trap effects, simple but good graphics. Trap diversity ir rarely used though. You can use alot, but often a concentration of 2-3 are the best.
871	1	a	Good game, but short.
3559	1	a	This game has improved a lot. Honestly, it's worth the $15. I have played it at a friends house quite a lot, and on my own PC here. I stopped playing when ti first came out, because to be honest, it sucked.  It doesn't suck now. It is suprisingly fun.   I think if you're on the fence because of the old reviews, you should go to youtube and find some newer gameplay, or ask some people here about the state it is currently in. I reccomend it.
5609	0	a	I want my money BACK!!!!! -.-
2256	0	a	Despite having a relatively good computer, I found it really hard to play this game. Many of the reviews had good things to say, though, and I wish I was able to experience all that it is capable of.  Maybe I'll try again at another date!
739	1	a	Surprisingly fun and well put together tower defense game. In a similar fashion to Sanctum, you place traps in the path of your enemies to protect the gate from every wave of increasingly stronger Orcs. You can also use multiple spells and weapons at your disposal to help even the odds. Managed to get 15 hours on my first play through so lots of good gameplay there for the price!  TL;DR: Game is good n' â¥â¥â¥â¥. Go buy it.
1852	1	a	best fps game in world
5783	1	a	It's okay, but I got bored after a while :c One of those games where I wish I can give it a neutral recommendation.
5764	1	a	Worth every single penny, Great time waster, Awesome multiplayer fun, and the most amazing level and weapons system ive seen in a game so cheap!
1025	1	a	this is a fun game that incolces a lot of mayhen and highjinxes but can also challenge your skill.
2868	1	a	It's an okey FPS game. But it gets boring after a while.
825	1	a	This game is a great tower defence game, really cool design and nice graphics... absolute steal on the humble bundle I got it from.
4286	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
1287	1	a	Very good, polished and dissestressing
2833	1	a	This is the most fun you can have for $1.
3395	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2213	1	a	Few times in one's life do they get the opportunity to do the things that you can do in this game. I have been blessed with the oppurtunity to shoot dinosaurs in the crotch while driving mech suits and tanks.   Doesn't sound relaxing enough?   Perhaps you enjoy pushing your friends and dinosaur corpses through the blood and feces of a now endangered species with state of the art ragdoll physics?  And how can we forget about the CryEngine level graphics and in-depth storyline? I was hooked from the beginning of the 10 level massacre to the end. I became legitimately worried about the sanity and morality of the characters and even the dinosaurs. The game creates a player-glitchy NPC bond that can only be created on the incredibly diverse levels that the developers have created. Don't even get me started on the animations! They were 'Transformers' quality and left me in awe every time I looked at them in 3rd person mode.   Basically, this game gives you an oppurtunity to achieve your goals and conquer your greatest fears in one incredible experience.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26/10 would recommend to public ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Best game on Steam. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4678	1	a	It is the best story game i have ever seen . Play and you wont cry!!
5171	0	a	What a terrible game
1048	1	a	Very fun! Very cheap!
3792	1	a	Tl:dr although this game is only a dollar, it's still fundamentally broken and loses it's charm after a couple of hours   Longer version. Orion prelude is a game about killing Dino's in space. It's a cool idea but it gets boring quickly. The main gamemode 'Conquest' consists of killing Dinos defending your base and capturing more land. It's fun, but after around 5 hours the different weapons and skills make no difference. The other game modes are more of the same and are not a printed are conquest. Although the devs fixed the Dino A.I the CPUs are still broken. I don't recommend playing by yourself for more than a hour.  To wrap up the game is worth a dollar, go ahead and buy it but it's not worth more than around 5-10 hours
3947	1	a	Lagged quite a bit when i started but when i put the graphics down it became great and quite a fun game.

5015	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
6399	1	a	I shot a T-Rex in the face with a tank and then had a little Compy blow up my tank with it's baby jaws.  10/10 Clever Gurl     I have to say other than server lag this game is very addictive. It is dated looking sure but plays awesome. Cool guns and weaponized transport 'inspired' by the likes of Halo this game can be hard to stop playing unless you lose connection to the server. And it's only a dollar, I bet you use more than a dollars worth of TP a day.
491	1	a	Really nice Tower Defense Game, that let's you take a very active fighting role, if you want! Don't make the mistake of thinking: 'meh, another TD game'!
241	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredible new take on tower defense and full of action packed strategy!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTYqMiAfe7w 
2014	1	a	So Cool game!!!!! Very cool game! i like alote!
5971	0	a	Also just 3 â¬ in the summer sale were too much for this game....
4714	1	a	i cant play it seid i had to donlode what i had 
2172	1	a	Fun game, lots of problems, get it on sale or whenever they give it to you for free which is almost god damn every month. So, that's a thing.
947	1	a	If you are a fan of tower defense, third person shooting, headshots, and Orcs then this is a must buy. Also look into the sequel.
3021	1	a	Really good for the price. Actually really fun.
1925	0	a	So u this robot who ... yeah
3656	1	a	ALL CAPS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  GOD DAMN  LISTEN TO ME.    THIS IS THE BEST VALUE THAT YOU CAN GET ON STEAM.
5235	0	a	Here is my constructive opinion :  Don't buy it.  Thanks.
2244	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BEST GAME YEAAA 10/10 A MASTERPIECE
3480	0	a	A game of the year contender for 1492. A great pile of dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game. I love the lag and how poorly optimized this is. I got for the price of free. My 'special' friend gave it to me. The multiplayer is just as great* i was a laggy T-Rex munching on wannabe Spartans from Halo. Of course the object of this game is to survive the world's laggiest envirments and cute Dino puppys. Overall this game is the aborted child of Jurassic Park and Halo. Its a gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 jk i h8 this game and id rather masturb8 to german dungeon porn. A book of the year and a gr8 contender for the Grammys. In the end this game gets 0/0 would not rate again.   * Great=Bad Kids if you buy this game full price play russian roulete with a RPG. I am not liable for any injuries from activities i have suggested in this review.

3673	0	a	The good part of this game is that i only waisted 50 cents 10/10 would buy again
4584	1	a	It's not great but you can get a dollar's worth of fun out of it easily.
5878	1	a	Orion: Prelude is an FPS dinosaur-based game. It feels like it takes place in the future.  The gameplay is designed well, and there is a large variety of maps to play on. The dinosaurs are spot-on, and the objectives make the game a lot more fun. There is a multiplayer function, but it sometimes won't work. This game has tons of potential. Especially for a game that costs $0.99. It is easily worth the one dollar.  Pros: Great gameplay Well designed guns, maps and enemies Helpful upgrades Challenging objectives Large variety  Cons: Multiplayer may get a bit shaky. For me, atleast.  Overall: 9.4/10
3702	0	a	Buy? No.  And that suggestion is after all the praise quotes from the current trailer about the game being improved and deserving a second chance.  Dino Horde is a sequel/successor to Orion: Dino Beatdown with was universally terrible. It is a first person horde shooter much like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, a between round weapon and augment store, and vehicle mechanics from a poor man's Halo. I felt a little disgusted after shooting my first weapon, which had a tinny sound effect and no recoil. Oddly enough, the recoil does come up sometimes. The guns just have this weak and unfinished feel. Dino waves are sent to you at lightning speed and most half-decent teams can wipe them out pretty quickly as they are sent in a couple packs that's easy to spray and pray at. When you're new, you might miss the opportunity to kill enemies or at least get a hit on them so you can get some assist credit. What makes the waves system even more terrible is the pacing. While you do have a variety of enemies, with some being faster than others, fighting them still often ends up being mass killing the Raptor-types, then finishing off the stragglers of larger, bullet sponge dino's and 'godd**ned bats' trope pterodactyls. Killing Floor has a better variety and pacing of enemies, as the speed of different mobs are more noticible and require proper prioritizing and handling by your group depending on the map you're playing.  Ammo is all handled by an ammo pack at the weapon store, so better hope you killed/assisted enough dinos and be able to make it back to the stores far away in the base after the game told you to go to the other side of the map for an outpost. I can accept the texture, model and animation quality for a cheap indie title. I think the texture quality is pretty good in comparison to Killing floor, and the animation is perhaps finicky in some cases, but the dinosaurs generally look life-like. Sound assets are pretty terrible as guns sound weak, majority of the voice acting sounds ham-fisted and terrible, save for maybe the announcer and the female scout, and the same one or two tracks repeat through the entirety of the game - menus, gameplay and all. Vehicles are extra handy in later waves, but can be a pain to drive, and lead to you demise if you get stuck and a Triceratops rams the ride, making it explode. The land hovercraft kept wobbling on the ground and I had annoyances managing the tank. Regardless, the game ended up feeling shallow very quickly - the fun factor wasn't there and I didn't see any reason to stay and level up.  I think the vast majority of the player base are probably younger types who got this on sale/as a gift and may not have much else to play. I'd hate to have played this before all the 'improvements'. There are plenty of better alternatives like Warframe, Payday series, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effecct 3, even Call of Duty Co-ops and Transformers Cybertron co-ops.  That being said, this game seem to have carved it's own niche, as there were a decent amount of active servers to join (like 20 or more), though that could be due to the recent .99 sale. That's probably telling alot about the quality and value of the game if it is going for 93% off when it's not a big Steam seasonal sale. I think kids and teens with more time and less money are willing to deal with this game (in fact, I probably would have been ok with it in my childhood), but adults like myself and most people on my friends list only have limited time and shouldn't waste it on this when there are better alternatives.  Don't buy it.The premise of Dino Horde FPS sounds cool, but you can get a similar and more entertaining as well as solid experience from Killing Floor. Once I got my opinion of the game, I only stayed longer to get my card drops....which I probably shouldn't have because they're pretty worthless.
4673	0	a	Its pretty terrible. Not even worth .99 cents.
2144	1	a	Cheap game but very enjoyable. though graphics is outdated for me its gameplay is nice. But kinda boring playing alone.And If you go online Few players are there and sometimes no one.  But this game really worth its price .. so i recommend this for every gamers out there.  NOTE: if you dont know the name of some dinosaurs you'll know it emmidiatly when you play this game, and not just their name but also their cute faces.
4294	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
2109	1	a	I got lens flare from looking up at the sky.      At night. 10/10
5462	0	a	Devs should've stopped 3 years ago. They were right, this game was terrible. Not worth $0.50.
4660	1	a	DO NOT BUY. I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR 99 CENTS AND ITS NOT WORTH IT
1199	1	a	Fun game if you have nothing to do, haven't touched in a while though ^_^
1018	1	a	This game is surprisinglly addictive. Far superior to Sanctum in my opinion. This game is definately a sleeper hit of this year.
2117	1	a	At just under 2 hours played -  - Running over raptors with vehicle = Yes - Lightsaber dinos to death = Yes - Jetpacking over entire map = Yes - Eaten by T-Rex = Yes  Halo with dinosaurs at 39p!!!!
6069	1	a	This ga,e is alright. If it is still on sale for under 4 dollars than I would say it is worth it. Otherwise DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH A TEN FOOT POLE, IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
6059	0	a	I bought this game when it was $0.99 and I want every cent back. It's borderline unplayable. I don't understand why this game has any positive reviews. I'm pretty sure my review will be deleted shortly. If you can see this, don't buy this unholy mess of a game.
3366	1	a	for 99 cents yeah.
6129	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a knife. Never bring a T-Rex to a knifefight 9/10 would knife again.
4198	0	a	I used to play it with my bro but now the addded an update which for us ruined our fun i loved how you could be the dinosuar but now its not the same,thank you
3909	1	a	if it was crap first, they fixed it now. Reminds me of a mix between Section 8: Prejudice and Killing Floor. stupid not to get it at one eurodollarz
3544	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is an interesting, multi-player game. Although the concept of Dino Carnage With Friends has already come into play, Orion Dino Horde does it well, with science fiction laser weapons, the ability to play as a dinosaur, special objectives, and three special classes, all with a useful mechanic to help win a game. However, I found lag an issue on a computer like mine, 500 mb hard drive, 4 gb RAM, and lowest quality on the game, but i still had 20 fps. If you have a good computer, its a good game, but otherwise invest in something else. I still recommend it though. 7/10

3711	0	a	No i feel like I wasted 99 cents so yea its pretty bad
3076	1	a	They should rename the game to 'Orion: Dino Hoe'  Because that's how i felt when i was playing the game.
838	1	a	I was genuinely surprised by this game. I like killing Orcs, (thank you Warhammer: Space Marine) so I decided to pick this up. It is simply a great game. The dialogue knows its place, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely solid. A great balance between combat and defensive strategy. The maps ramp in difficulty quite nicely, and the creators were smart to add enemies that will mess with tactics that worked a few maps ago. Forcing the player to really think about each map is something that shows good game design and I really admire it. If you like tower defense games and are looking for something a bit different, definitely check this out.
1236	1	a	An utterly fun game, Orcs Must Die! combines FPS with placing down traps. Probably not a new idea, but that doesn't in any way, shape, or form detract from the enjoyability, so let's get into some pros and cons.  Pros -It has some story elements (a big thing with me). This game could have gone without story altogether and still been fun, but the developers decided to spice it up! I mean, sure it's a pretty basic story, but, considering the game genre, I'll consider it a pro. -Responsive and intuitive controls that are easy to learn and get the hang of. -Normal (Warmage) difficulty getting boring? Try Nightmare difficulty for the challenge you crave. -Great music and graphics. -Great replayability across most levels (I say most because the first level, even on Nightmare, will get easy pretty quick). -Funny commentary from the characters. -DLC adds new weapons, traps, and levels.  Cons -No multiplayer. If you're not into that then this point is moot. -Only one character and set of weapons/traps. -DLC costs money. Might be a con to some. I wasn't personally bothered by it, but, then again, I probably got it on sale 'cause I'm cheap like that.  So, yeah, that's all I got. So go get it. It's worth its full price, but if you want to get it on sale, that's understandable. Anyways, it's a great game I would recommend to just about everyone.
899	1	a	This game is incredible!! Tower defense + realtime action + comedic humor = HOURS of great mindless entertainment. Highly recommend this to anyone!!
6390	0	a	I couldn't believe how bad this was. Worst game I've played all year. As much as I like getting to test games I wouldn't otherwise buy... This wouldn't even be worth downloading for free.
4652	1	a	very nice game still better than battlefield 3 :D
3764	1	a	The survival/horde gamemode of this game gets a bit repetetive after the first area has been cleared, and becomes very easy, since all the waves are as the first ones...
2751	1	a	You made it 0,99â¬ instead of a greedy 20â¬? Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. The first non-greedy game company in existance.
3117	1	a	A somewhat rickety dinosaur first person shooter, it makes for some very short periods of intense fun. It's definitely a game that you will want to play with friends, but have fun dealing with weird connection bugs. Overall, definitely worth $0.99.
2608	1	a	Game is fun for a few minutes and on a sale cost much as a phone app so get it

5713	0	a	My thread was deleted because I hurt the Steam Community's feelings but here's my review saying that the Steam Community voting this as a discount from 75 cents to 49 cents makes it the dumbest community on the internet:  The Steam Community voting this as a discount from 75 cents to 49 cents makes it the dumbest community on the internet. And I don't care what you have to say. Your opinion, unless it agrees with mine, is invalid based on the fact that you voted for a game to be 26 cents less. A game no one plays.
2278	1	a	This is the most 99 cent game I've ever played
4368	1	a	A lot of people rip on this game, but it really is a fun game. For me, I don't have a lot of free time, and this is an easy game to pick up and play in short bursts. Only have 15 min? Enough time to fire up and play Rampage for a bit. Have a few hours? Conquest mode will take that.  With that said, some of the complaints are true. Early on bugs were pretty frustrating, but offset by a lot of free add-on content. None of that is really much of an issue anymore - the worst bugs are worked out, but there are still some (minor) issues.  The online community isn't large, but what is there is pretty welcoming for a casual gamer like myself. Typically the online games are set to the easier modes (which are a little too easy). It is a little annoying that it's hard to find people willing to play on harder modes...  Overall, the game is fun, and for the price that it is, It's worth an add to your Steam library.
4668	1	a	Worth it
2917	1	a	Good for a 99c price
3647	1	a	I bought this back when it was orion dino beat down, i bought four copies and i still have two,the game? its well worth your time if its free ,but the money I spent? Well worth it, I love this game honestly ,my computer has a hard time with it but my pc has a potato graphics card.   In conclusion,should you get it? yes,of course it always been good,even when dubbed 'worst game of ever' It was good,even the community is good so just play it already you â¥â¥â¥
2525	1	a	Dino Horde. I really think this game is great. Fast paced, balanced achivement/ credit earning (changes based on difficulty setting) Really helps to play as a team, and feel free to guide new players in to helping the team's overall progress.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. Very replayable in the current release.  I would value this game around 15 - 20 USD all day long.   I am having trouble browsing/finding game matches/ servers. Usually about 10-15 come up, but I have trouble connecting to most of them. Often time I find myself in a Lobby, and It appears the host is AFK. Would also love to see projectile/paths added. Other than that is very fun. Give it a try!!
2083	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and knocked me off the triceratops I was attempting to ride for an achievement 10/10.  But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was ninety-nine cents!
2920	1	a	Really good game. This game has been driven into failure because of it's previous title ORION: Dino Beatdown, but Dino Horde is different, and it is a whole new, exiting and amazing overall game. Completely worth my 15 bucks.
616	1	a	It has great replayability You have to constantly re-think best strategy to pass the level and to maximize the number of skulls It has several improvements on magic, devices as you level up Story is fun and is refreshing to hear the funny comments with those voices. It doesnt stuck me to the computer hour after hour,because passing each level is so rewarding that  I can play one level and have all the fun that I need for a long time in which I can work , talk with my family and other everyday thing  It a simply superb game , dont count the hours you can waste on it but all the satisfaction you will have with it
2578	1	a	When this was released may 2014 it was junk!,now i love this game! with 60+ updates this game is not like the old one!,I recommend buying it its only 0,79$,Better than COD i can say, a mashup with hallo and jurassic park :)
107	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
3580	1	a	F.U.N    Orion: Dino Horde is Halo &amp; tribes together with Dinosaurs   Its FUN GET it and join Dolla &amp; me in some dino killing!
6068	0	a	Microtransactions and a pricetag, it's fun, but not my cup of tea.
4807	1	a	This game is so MLG PRO. People that dislike this game are all n00bs, because the game has de best Graffix ever. Its all about trickscoping the Dinosaurs with Snipar rifles.
3103	1	a	Dion is a motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2483	1	a	A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends
5240	0	a	Wasted a dollar 10/10
6368	1	a	Is this game perfect? No. It has its flaws and bugs but is a very fun little game to have in your library. For a regular price of 0.99$ and also goes (goes?) on sale occaisionally this is a fun game
2365	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!  9/2 Would not â¥â¥â¥â¥.  play it
5839	1	a	The game is bland, and not too interesting, though it has nice graphics. Would I recommend it to people? Well, it's cheap! Especially if you get it on sale. At the time of this writing, it was only 49 cents. That's less that the cost of a candy bar...Yea, it's worth that! Regular price? I wouldn't bother with it.
1170	1	a	when you like RPG titles,you must buy this game 10/10(i never see game like this)
122	1	a	This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:  1. How in the hell does the skull system work...??? 2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...??? 3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???  Here are the short versions to those answers:  1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious 'target time' that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select 'statistics' from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.  2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.  3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.  If you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:  1. Wind Bracers 2. Archers 3. Tar pits 4. Barricades 6. Ice amulet 7. Steel Weaver -&gt; Death Augmenter  You'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.  You'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.  Are fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.  It's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.  I'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.
1467	1	a	Shank 2 is a beat em up sequel of Shank from the developer Klei who makes Mark of The Ninja. like Mark of The Ninja, Shank 2 has a really good animations and presentation. the humor, cutscenes and the gameplay really makes this game so enjoyable to play. the combinations of melee attacks, heavy attacks and range weapons are really good that it makes the players free to experiment with a combo that works best in certain situation. Shank 2 is a fast-paced game but it also has some slow motions that works well, it makes the players rest a little from its fast-paced world and come back again. Shank 2 successfully blends beat em up with strategy because if you play just to keep attacking, you'll end up dead. Shank 2 is a really hard game which forces the players to plan a quick strategy for successfull attacks. Shank 2's story is a combination of violence and humor. some times it's really violent and some times it's funny but Shank successfully combine both aspects to be a good game. unfortunately, Shank 2 has a very short length of Story Campaign and it doesn't really do well in telling the characters and what's happening in its world. nevertheless Shank 2 is an enjoyable game with very good gameplay, good animations and presentations. it just doesn't really have longer length and story. 7.5/10
2302	1	a	Best game I ever bought
1960	1	a	Came for BEEP Saw BEEP Played as BEEP Killed with BEEP Had fun as BEEP  10/10 Would BEEP again
4233	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
4486	1	a	Just great !!!!
3981	1	a	Laughed at friend buying this game thought it looked â¥â¥â¥â¥. got given copy spent the next 2 hours epically fighting Trex's. A terex through a boulder at my face. 11/10 would take a boulder to the face again.
1149	1	a	+ Great story ! + Awesome art and characters ! + Great weapons and traps ! + hours of story  + The only tower of defence game i like &lt; trust me thats an achivement !  ------- IF YOU GRAB THIS BE SURE TO GET GOTY OR ALL DLC --------- without them its just a little less fun but all those are worth your money !
4917	1	a	This idea should be picked up by a more capable developer, updated with better graphics and gameplay tweaks and could become like L4D with dinos
782	1	a	At the beginning of each level the characters have some lines. On one of the last levels I was rolling. Just a funny â¥â¥â¥ line.   Fun game to play.
4515	0	a	I thought I'd give this a shot since it was so cheap but honestly I could not enjoy this game in any way, shape or form. This is just my opinion and who knows, maybe you'll like it more.
4361	1	a	I got the option to make a review for a game I never played    The trailer looks cool,might pick it up
4875	1	a	This is a very interesting game. I've only played it for a little, but I think it could be interesting. However, right now it seems a little rote. Perhaps the more I get into it, the more I will like it.
2377	1	a	Don't trust the Metacritic score. This game is absolutly amazeballs.
127	1	a	This game actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Stragtigically placing all the wonderfully wicked traps to kill as many Orcs as possible before they get to the point where you have to fend them off is a great challange. Picking your traps is fun considering there are many to choose from. traps are also upgradable which is definatley a nice touch. Would I recommend this game, yes to anyone. So why not go on over and get your copy now and while you are there grab Orcs must die 2 and the DLC....I did!
200	1	a	Fun game full of orcy destruction.
3176	1	a	really love this game, my friend bought it for me and we always play it together, so much fun its really awesome. kudos to the developers
779	1	a	A great mix of Tower Defence and Shooter .
4748	1	a	I Saw My Frined Riding a Cockroach-Like Vehicles... While I do 1080 With Helicopter.  'Best 1080-Heli Simulator Ever' - 11/10 IGN
3765	1	a	cool game
2354	1	a	better than ARK
4265	0	a	Prelude to what? Oh god, what am I playing?!
3795	1	a	not as bad as i thort it was going to be well worth 99p definatly reminds me of halo and turok :) good game for online playing :)
955	1	a	Quite nice TPP tower defense game. A bit like Dungeon Defenders but less spammy, and no local multi.
4070	0	a	I bought this games and its F2P now? Do i get a free in game bonus?
1285	1	a	Nothing will give you the shooting satisfaction of this game. The graphics are beutiful. Lots of explotions and different weapons.
1823	1	a	Old but gold.
5835	1	a	the game is a fast fun shotting game where you run around and shoot dinosaurs its really fun if you got a group to play with ii was the best 1 dollar i ever spent on a game that was so good i have spent more money on games that are worse belive me i injoyed this one
1719	1	a	Simple yet fun.  This game is prollly intended for a 5-8 year old. Dangit, apperently I'm too young to drink....
946	1	a	Loved. Every. Moment.
3769	1	a	Dinossaurs, Jetpacks, and Rocket Launchers. Enought said.
4495	1	a	Some of the most fun I have had in any FPS besides the half life series.  It's worth 5 times the pricetag.  You get dual pistols, flamethrowers, jetpacks, and mechs, and you fight FRICKING dinosaurs, with beautiful gameplay, this is one of the best co-op FPS's ever made.
4803	1	a	If you ignore the politics over game assets then this is a fun game!
4248	0	a	I paid for this game and now it is free to play !! WTF ?   Game is not that bad btw...
299	1	a	this is very fun and unique, played through it many times and it encourages you to go back and perfect the game. Reminds me of plants vs zombies in its addictiveness.
5855	0	a	Game is buggy, crashed and DCes during games. One crash caused me to lose my progress. Would not recomend.
6123	0	a	why the f does it not run right f***** douches i s[ent 15$ on it
6055	1	a	This game is downright off the wall silly. you want a wave based survival game, you got it, you want a futuristic shooter, you got it, you want vehicles, you get 6 or 7 different types, you want multiplayer, bring 4 friends with you into survival. you want pvp, do it up. this game has it all, including shenanigans. honestly i really enjoyed it and will play more. 2.6 hours in the past 40 hours of owning it, and thats just cause ive had business to attend to off of steam
3732	0	a	its decent, have potential but the fact that you can just hide on something up high and never get hit makes it too easy :l
2582	1	a	a cheap good game....now thats is unique.
3632	1	a	Great game
4558	1	a	Buy this game , if you want to waste your money.
3883	1	a	+1
2182	1	a	What the hell Bren, this is actually fun.
5990	1	a	fun multiplayer and great with friends
6267	1	a	Who wouldn't want to shoot a dino's head off for a dolla?
881	1	a	This is a SUPER fun game to play!
6458	1	a	Definitely worth the 99 cents for a fun multiplayer dinosaur-hunting game.
4666	1	a	I dont know .... like 7/10 -2 becouse the gameplay -1 becouse i waned to be DINOSAURS VS ROBOTS or something not BOTS DINOSAURS i want like in Dino d day .
3582	1	a	Just One Word...... AWESOME!!!
859	1	a	The best rgp 3ird person Tower defance I hav eevery played well the only one I have played but still worth it the sequal is comming out soon also worth it the only bad thing is you will get tired half why through need commitment
4158	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
3783	1	a	Okay, a few months ago, this review would've ended up being pretty negative to say the least. But I must admit, these guys don't give up and keep updating and improving the game - to a degree, where it has not much to do with the initially released bugfest you might have laughed at or being so mad of, that you've refunded your money on Steam. Right now, the game is at a point, where it is stable, runs (finally) fluid, has a decent gunplay and most importantly: it's fun. Yes, with jetpacks and dinosaurs and mechs and that stuff, it is rather cheesy, but it doesn't take itself too serious, which feels kinda refreshing. They've also polished the look and added quite some content. I think, this one deserves a second chance. When there is a free weekend or a sale, go check it out.
3294	1	a	Fists are more effective than guns on dinosaurs, who knew? 11/10
4459	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
2702	1	a	This game costs 80p A 500g tin of chopped tomatoes also costs 80p  This game has dinosaurs  Chopped tomatoes do not  Logic = Buy this game 10/10 - if this game were a tomato, it would be the best tomato  In all honesty it's hilarious and a load of fun with friends Absolutely priceless, best 80p ever spent
6253	1	a	its...ok  has some technical difficulties but ovl its decent, for sure worth the price just for few hours
5970	1	a	Its has dinosaurs and Nice VEHICLES what else can you ask for a game!!
2340	1	a	Was not expecting this to be much of a game halo vs jurassic park was my first impression oh how wrong i was its a challenge its funny and iwould suggest everyone gives it a try. survival mode multi player awesome times grab a can grab your mates and get to killing everything that moves :)
828	1	a	A very good game,nice visuals,great soundtrack!
3351	1	a	Fun, dumb game dont take it too seriously :)
544	1	a	I'm a big Bloon Tower Defense player, so I thought that I had the end all of tower defense games on my iphone already. Oh how wrong I was. This is a great tower defense game, with a nice bit of hack-and-slash thrown in. I'm about halfway through the first act ( I think) and while some towers I have now seem to serve no purpose, and although I keep picking them when I first get them (eg steam trap without a combo for it) I'm sure later in the game they'll have a great combo (certain trap seem to be designed to be put together).  The only thing I wish is that I could choose from any trap/weapon whenever I want, instead of picking and choosing a certain amount at the start of a round. It's just something I'm used to from playing Bloons, but I've gotten over it already. Thats part of the challenge.  I'd give this a 8/10
3973	1	a	This is the best game I have ever played.  Half-Life 4, forged in the greatest altar of the High Heavens, made from Gabe Newell's sweet, sweet, tears, could never compare.  Needless to say, this game gets me Tyrannosaurus-E-REKT.
574	1	a	Bought for achievement in Orcs Must Die! 2, but now i think its much better for single player. It is a shame there is no co-op version for this game, but i still reccomend it!
1772	1	a	Nice BEEP... Game BEEP...
88	0	a	Ho hum. Incomplete - a prologue to a vaporware game. The card graphics are simply ordinary playing cards, the story is slight to the point of invisibility and totally linear. The gameplay is mildly amusing, maybe a fraction above playing MS Solitaire, but not complex enough to reward paying it much attention. Worth a dollar or two purely as a solitaire game, but certainly not worth paying even close to full price for.
4812	1	a	a sick game
4561	1	a	Such a fantastic game for such a low price! Really like the concept of the game and the gameplay is ridiculously fun :)) I could run around and stab dinosaurs in the face all day! :D
819	1	a	Not quite tower defense, not quite action game, but it is definitely awesome. It's fast-paced, quite replayable, very humorous, pretty challenging. Music's pretty cool as well. I love this game to pieces... with traps.
4578	0	a	Even free it's not worth it. Don't waste your time.
5255	0	a	1. Bought the game. 2. Played 5-10 min. 3. Refunded the game :)
4682	1	a	10/10 would have rocks thrown at me by T-Rexs again
428	1	a	Slice, dice, crush, smash, fling, shatter, stab and shoot all the orcs you can. How much better can it get?
188	1	a	I'll keep this short and sweet. This game was a great mash-up between strategy and tower defense. Only took me about 4 hours to beat the whole game. Would have been nice to have some multiplayer/co-op, but for that I'm am looking forward to the sequel. Grab it when it's on sale and spend an afternoon or weekend enjoying this game. Excellent replay value as well.
5153	0	a	This game was a glitchy busted mod that is masked as full game. I would avoid it
5227	0	a	Im removing this from my account, check steam support to do that. No refund was possible, besides therea a reason its a dollar game. Don't buy this.  Also awful company, they steal other peoples work.
3886	1	a	Oh Dino Horde. I love this game, one of my reasons to join steam. It has a few flaws, what game does not, but in the end it is a very fun title that will give you a lot of happiness and will let you loose, as much loose as you can be while charged by HORDES (title does not lie) of prehistoric Reptiles that try to either get you or crash the Generator you have to protect. This game is built on team wok, so it is going to be based on what people you play with either you going to have a lots of gunblazing fun or running back and forth fixing your generator while being munched on by some compy, because other players have left to do whatever. Beside that, the only other thing that can spoil your play time is an occasional lag (hopefully they have fixed that since the last time I have played). So yeah, if you would buy this game, it would be great. No seriously, it is 0.99 right now, and it has Guns, Dinosaurs and awesome vehicles, go get it.
3089	1	a	This is a fun little team based shooter which involves you, the player, gunning down... well, dinosaurs. Hundreds of 'em, in droves. If you ever get tired of shooting at dinosaurs, then there's a whole host of different modes to choose from, including several styles of PvP. You can even turn the tables and play as a dinosaur yourself. The developers are very prompt about keeping this game up to date and adding new content, and have already released a huge update in the short time I've been playing it. Good work guys!  Pros: - Caters to a range of different playstyles. You can play in first and third person, solo or in a group. - Customisable characters provide a huge range of options. - A range of vehicles to choose from. Ever felt like blasting hordes of raptors with a tank? - Constantly updated with new maps, game modes and big fixes.  Cons: - Currently a little buggy, though mostly minor stuff like sounds not playing properly and dinosaurs getting stuck. - The music can be repetitive - While the game  can  be played alone, it's noticeably built with multiplayer in mind. Most game modes are considerably more fun with friends.  TL;DR: This game is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Why not give it a try?
5344	1	a	epic thats all i can use to describe it 
427	1	a	Great fun and a nice combination of strategicly planing your defense and bashing away orcs in direct combat.
5329	1	a	Its a fun and cheap game, bought it for my friends
4077	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
4089	1	a	Reasons to play! 1. Super fun  2. Completely free!  3. Supportive and open developer  4. Character progression and customization 5. Different classes for different play-styles and class roles 6. Dinosaurs (Duh!) 7. Jetpacks, mechs, helicopters, tanks, hovercraft, jeeps etc. 8. Lasers Swords and good sword play! 9. PvP and coop, and PVPVE too (players protect bases in teams and can sick dinosaurs on other teams) and gamemodes where you can be the dinos too 10. You can surf on the hood of your buddies jeep/hovercraft/tank/helicopter  Reasons to not play :[ 1. You hate fun?
1044	1	a	A fun fast-paced tower defense
822	1	a	This is a pretty awesome game, don't let the Orcs invade your Castle
2855	1	a	at $0.99 I have already enjoyed this game tremendously for what I spent. Only have 2hrs in at the moment, but those were a couple of really fun hours for me and my buddies. This game has some terrible reviews, but I think it has come a long way since those reviews. Bottom line, this is a good game for its price, and a GREAT game for its current sale price.
5895	1	a	played one game, got picked up by a birdosaur 10/10
2831	0	a	Play this if you hate yourself... and dinosaurs!
792	1	a	When i first played Orcs Must Die i thought what is with all the hype. Recently i've been playing more and more of it, and finally understanding what all the hype is about. Great game for relaxing and just killing things. Turn on some music, and have a great time killing orcs.
2520	1	a	By far the best game for 1 EUR I ever played till now. DINOSAURS! You ARE SHOOTING DINOSAURS :D:D:D Add a Level and Loot-System = Perfect.
5047	0	a	Trash. but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was 99 cents
3352	1	a	You can run dinosaurs over with a tank 10/10 
5463	0	a	Pings were so high!
6246	1	a	Made my day a few times, bought it on sale with friends, worth it!
5982	1	a	i wish i hade this game but my mom wont buy me â¥â¥â¥â¥  
1778	1	a	The game is simple, move around, pick stuff up, shoot enemies, and do some platforming. Can entertain for a while.
6163	0	a	Game costs a dollar for a reason. Crashed as soon as I joined a server.
4908	1	a	10/10  best game ever  because DINOSAURs
4026	1	a	Played one game of survival...................... WHY IS THIS GAME ONLY 49 CENTS TAKE MY MONEY TAKE ALL MY MONEY! I have only gotten a chance to play the survival mode and what I saw was well worth the 49 cents and then some, I loved watching the T-Rex tear my teammates to shreds..... 10/10 would let them get eaten again
2462	1	a	Sometimes I want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ a dinosaur but be careful that you dont get dinosaur STD e.g dino genital herpes, Dino aids and dino gonorrhea and GTD but i love seeing that dinosaur riding my â¥â¥â¥â¥ and me cumming in its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but it is fun.
1598	1	a	Another fun tower defense game. Much more fun than I expected.
628	1	a	Just bought this game on sale for $3.74, and it was worth it. I've only played 10 minutes to get a christmas achievement, and I want to play more. Headshots are so easy, and killing orcs is pretty fun!
5083	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
1866	1	a	Beep is a Steamified flashgame.   It's hard, but not to hard and worth the 1$.  Why do I say this? Well, what's 1$ to support a developer that creates a game for young and old.  I really enjoyed playing the game, hence I created a video out of it:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ3-cVjPZFo   If you are looking for a fun, stylish, easy to control, Space robot game than this is it for you and your kids.
2300	1	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun its unreal. There is a survival horde mode and PvP. A solid 10 hours of fun AT LEAST
5158	0	a	The Metascore is misleading? This game got a user score of 3.9, yeah, misleading; sure;)
3325	1	a	I think this game was a smash hit a real 2/10 effort. whoever made this game did a great job with the following: putting dinosaurs in their game. i found myself on the edge of my seat as the T-rex's would throw boulders at me and charge at a break neck pace, and with a great storyline you cant go wrong. you will find after a solid playthrough along with the only other 1 person in the world that plays this game will enlighten you on how to fight dinosaurs with ridiculously strong weapns with zero recoil. i rate this game a 4 out of 5 out of 10. I hope to never play this game again within my lifetime. if someone held a gun to my head and told me to play this game, I'd choose death.
6310	1	a	Great game everone likes it.For $0.99 it has as much value as a game that is for $60.00. Must have must play.Rating 8.9/10.
1992	1	a	BEEP is a nice puzzle-adventure mix. At first I was deterred by the combination of simple graphics and the realistic physics simulation, but after a couple of minutes I got used to it.  In the game you have to jump through the levels, solve puzzles, collect stuff and shoot some (few) baddies.
3791	0	a	Not worth it, not even for free.
5807	1	a	It's a good game for how cheap it is and if you have a bunch of friends playing it can be a laugh. However it would be nice if the devs implemented some gun sounds xD
5892	1	a	I like this game. Especially when i play it with my friends. Maybe they can add weapon attachment customization system.
4004	1	a	ORION: Prelude has changed me forever. It has made me a different person.
3290	1	a	Great game for the price, lots of fun!
4067	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
4227	0	a	its awful, simply awful
4173	1	a	Negative review about a game for 0.79â¬ should be a crime ...
4816	0	a	should be a free game
6326	1	a	this is the best game i have ever played. it is perfect.
6442	1	a	such dino  much blood  so good
3971	0	a	Very poorly made game. Logic is cringeworthy but it has it's moments. Would reccomend ONLY on cheap sales.
4393	1	a	it is rilly fun
2531	1	a	NIce game for 0,27 $ ! Love to killl Dino with Friend !
911	1	a	While writing this review, I have not yet beaten this game. In fact, I'm pretty sure I still have ways to go. However, after quite a bit of anticipation, I'm glad to say that this game is worth its weight. Its a unique spin to a genre that is getting more popular and offers a ton of variety. Without having to due any calculation whatsoever in terms of placing down this or that, I simply go with what I prefer. There is plenty of choice and strategy.    The flow of the game goes quite well with its style of humor and aesthetics. It reminds me a bit of Heretic/Hexen in terms of weaponry/magic and the music strikes a resembling similarity to Warcraft 2.   My only complaint is the lack of multiplayer. While a great game on its own, having the ability to play with someone else would make it much much more entertaining. However, one can only hope that it will be future content... otherwise I'll just get Dungeon Defenders when it is released.  5/5 Rating
5364	1	a	Great Game But The 1 Thing Thats wrong is that the dino are way to fast but its a fun game highly recomned
6290	1	a	So, bought this game after reading an article about it (forget where). Picked up a 4-pack for my wife and a couple buddies, figured if nothing else it'd be worth the three whole bucks I paid for it.  So far, I've only got 5hrs on record this week, and I've been pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is pretty solid from what I've played so far (mostly survival and the one where you have multiple bases to defend). I look forward to doing some PvP stuff with my buddies to test that out.  From what I've seen so far - the graphics, sounds, etc are all pretty decently done. I've noticed only a few grahpical errors (such as when first bringing up a new gun that I purchased, it took a second for the model to fully load in), but otherwise I haven't really noticed any game breaking bugs.   If you're on the fence on this at all, I'd highly recommend picking it up - especially at $0.99. It's a solid little sci-fi dino-hunting that will give at least a few hours of play time, if not more.
3877	0	a	The trailer is right: don't believe the Metacritic review. 36/100? I don't understand where they got all those points from..  If you enjoy things like: Loadout customization where your Primary Weapon choices are: 'Connection Error' and six other blank slots Bleeding ears after the T-Rex roars 20x louder than the rest of the game Crash on alt-tab Graphics from the 16th Century A wide variety of 3 classes that all spawn you with some kind of generic block thing Running 3000m to start the game  Then I would recommend this game for you, you stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5954	1	a	Great game :) Don't expected an indie multiplayer/coop shooter to be that good :)
2621	1	a	This is basically the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with fewer bugs and dinosaurs instead of aliens. Definitely worth the purchase, I spent less than five bucks so I can shoot dinosaurs in the face with three friends. Worth every penny.
4214	1	a	Im not a graphics guy so I dont care but, the graphics were meh.  But besides it being rushed, and not really telling you what to do, its a fun game!
4873	1	a	good except I CANT CHANGE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CONTROLS PROPERLY. â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FIX IT. IM TRYING TO CHANGE SCORE BOARD TO SELECT BUT IT CHANGES JUMP TO SELECT
372	0	a	repetitive and boring
5253	1	a	I've been having so much fun playing Dino Horde that I forgot to eat and died!
4290	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
3782	1	a	Let's not be roundabout. This game is fun.   Killing Floor + Halo + Jurassic Park = WORTH
1996	1	a	Lovely little game, worth the few cents, excellent classic gameplay.
3750	0	a	guns need better sound effects, open world is nice but leaves much to be desired, there is no cover to hide behind or in or building to shoot from roof tops or towers, no cities or city ruins to run a muck through... just a couple guns, open area to run around and dinos to shoot that spawn in waves. i would say it's 'back to the drawing board' guys. the game mechancis are solid and create a good foundation for what could of been a really fun game had they taken advantage of level design and gameplay is poor and instantly repetative.
294	1	a	I iz an Orc and I fink dis game is inkredibly rood.
226	1	a	Like tower defense games? How about in third person? Also do you like killing lots of orcs? Well then Orcs Must Die is the game for you as it has all 3. It's a really fun and addictive third person tower shooter game with really good gadgets and varied and tough enemies. You get to be really creative with the defense using all the neat gadgets in your arsenal. Also, the A.I is good in this game. Overall, if you like tower defense games, you'll have plenty of fun times in this game.
5307	0	a	no wonder this game is 1 dollar dont even bother with this game its really bad
1162	1	a	Extremely fun and well polished game. Must have for any Tower Defence player who also enjoys being in the thick of the action.
3736	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
622	1	a	love this game TD &amp; TPS Shooter= Exelent game Bravo
3369	1	a	An interesting mix of Dino's meets Killing Floor. Not a bad game but the lag is noticable, even as host which is annoying. Animations could be much smoother and enemy AI leaves much to be desired. Still though, for 1 dollar, it's a steal.
1853	1	a	Beep Beep Beep. That's will you feels whenever to play this game. Somehow this game also pretty dark fo me. Especially when you already found the finish line but still couldn't find the rest of orbs in the map and the OST is catchy enough.
1085	1	a	Best Tower Defence game ever
875	1	a	Orcs Must Die. Just Orcs Must Die. This game got me hooked since the moment I put a feet on the world of rifts, as the successor of the 'Old Man'. The different waves of orcs and different abilities you get after each level encourages playing, the graphics are amazing, the music is epic and I think I found one of my favorite all-time games. Can't wait to play the sequel. 9.5/10
5726	0	a	i played alot more in this game than i should have... had more fun than i should have why brick why
891	1	a	An instant classic. Shame it's only single player - we hope that OMD 2 will have a coop feature.
3277	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
6361	1	a	ITS LIKE DK BUT NOT REALLY EVEN LIKE IT! 10 ISIS Soldiers Out of 10!
3828	0	a	they should give us back our money 
5419	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
4298	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
2865	1	a	You know what they say... 'it has swig'  #ND2013
5060	0	a	50/100
33	0	a	Does not work in Mac OS 10.9 or 10.10. No support available from the company.
4547	0	a	WHERES TUROK ??
1533	1	a	good game to pass free time.. just u have loggin everytime to origin account to continue from where you left your game else start a new game again
171	1	a	This is a really enjoyable game.
497	1	a	awesome fun cant wait for multiplayer on orcs must die 2
671	1	a	Loved Orcs Must Die! So much fun and very satisfying setting up your traps for the orcs. Can be quite challenging in parts. Really looking forward now to Orcs Must Die! 2...
1484	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It mixes top-down, Metal Gear-style stealth mobility with puzzle elements. You can upgrade several different skills that can really change your approach to the game -- whether you prefer sneaking undetected, running and evading capture, or blowing up enemies from inside.  Graphics, sound, and controls are all nice. The story is somewhat linear, but fun nonetheless. Granted, it has that EA account nonsense, but I'd reccommend this.
4449	0	a	the developers are snakes
1542	1	a	Nice Puzzle game. It has charm, good pacing and the right lenght (about 5 hours). It's not as memorable as Portal or Braid, however, and the puzzles are on the easy side. I would say $5 is the perfect price for this game.   The store page says it requires Origin, but actually you just need to accept Origin's terms of service the first time you run the game, you don't need to run the client or log into Origin when playing.
5036	0	a	Played this game for not even 20 minutes, I got into a game at everything at medium and I get constant stutters, my team mates teleport everywhere and I had no f_uck1ng idea where any dinosaurs were cause I crashed a car into a f_uck1ng wall and died.  This game is honest â¥â¥â¥â¥, I would've played with friends, but they refunded it, before it became f2p
3177	1	a	New to the game? You'll love it. It never truly shines, but there is something delightful in equipping a flamethrower and baking crispy dino-treats. Or zooming around in Halo-esque vehicles causing general mayhem while you're being chased. This could be a very, very, very good game and at how cheap it is and it IS a good game. . . for a time.  Then there are the game modes that don't completely work. Game settings that never stick (I'm always having to change the visual settings even though I've saved them EVERY TIME.) A healing gun that sometimes won't heal (because the game doesn't properly show health bars.) Less than stellar UI. Boring and repetitive dinosaur mobs.   Maybe the reason why I recommend this game is because I can see what this game COULD be. At the core, it's a incredibly fun multiplayer game that is easy to pick up. Sadly, though, the game doesn't feel complete. Most people will put this down after a few hours and never pick it back up. . . which is a shame! Add some more customization, make more maps, fix the other game modes! There is really not a game quite like this out there - similar, yes, but not quite.   TL;DR: Buy this game. It's cheap and good for a few hours with friends. But don't keep it out of mind and let's see what the future can bring.
1665	0	a	Of all the hipster indie trash I've played, this is by far the most pretentious and pointless.
2932	1	a	Where is the Donate button?
5343	1	a	its a good games becaus it a rpg game so amzing i rate it 99999/99999 
5370	0	a	AWFUL it's total crap, maybe in 1995 would had seemed interesting now is outdated awful crap.
1015	1	a	If you are looking to have a lot of fun with great humor and no hard thinking, this game is for you! :-)
2551	1	a	Pretty fun game, kind of a mix between halo and left 4 dead. Can act slightly glitchy at times but no major things.  BUT THE DAMN BIRD DINOS, like jesus, give them a nerf please. Almost impossible to hit and can take you out so quickly.  8/10 so far.
1146	1	a	Kind of a Tower Defense game. Except you use traps, and you attack yourself too. Running around, shooting, stabbing, and exploding stuff.  It is a ton of fun, a crap ton of unique levels. At least try the demo!  WARNING: EXTREMELY FRIGGN ADDICTING
2170	1	a	Game is a lot of fun. Many of the modes require exercising precise teamwork. Updates have eliminated a lot of the bugs. The metacritic score does not do the game justice at all.
3210	1	a	Really cool type of game I have never seen before. A survival wave game... with dinosaurs.
4106	1	a	Why can't you hear a Pterodactyl going to the bathroom? Because the P is silent.. thank you this game sucks.
478	1	a	pretty sweet game...to bad u missed out on the 75%off sale!
5058	1	a	This game is a dino massacure. IT IS A GOOD BUY FOR A DOLLAR THERE IS SOME MICROTRANSACTIONS BUT ITS NOTHING YOU CANT AVOID.
5504	1	a	very good _ game 14.99$ :(
1427	1	a	This game is really fun. Shank is he toughest guy around. If a shark attacks him he rips its jaw out.
133	1	a	Definitely rare, when the entire objective of a game can be put into its title. Very easy to learn, nice build-up 'tutorial' (one thing every round), and funny characters with awesome lines.
1841	0	a	This game is so *BEEP*
1714	1	a	Very fun, is intuitive and easy to waste time on. Also it is cheap and the level select is cool! 8/10 would BEEP again
5506	1	a	Great game :D
1028	1	a	Orcs Must Die! GOTY Edition: BRILLIANT! Quippy one-liners, squishy orcs; what more can you ask for? For the extra Â£3, it's worth getting the GOTY version. It's a 2Gb download, which might take a few hours; but worth it. Graphics: good. Voice acting: Good (the one-liners are quite funny). The game is GOOD! A great defence game. GET IT! 
4219	1	a	This game... if it can even be called that... is   clearly   the most awe-inspiring and story driven interactive experience to date. This trumps almost every form of entertainment I have ever experienced. It outright blows other games, and even movie and television mediums, out of the water with its sheer impressiveness.   Truly a masterpiece  . It is outrageous to think that one could recieve the right impression of ORION: Prelude just through words upon a screen, or any other known method. Nothing can capture it's raw beauty and power, which still keeps me awake at night wondering what all the other asshat game developers are doing so very wrong. This experience can only be compared to the wonder of birth itself. ORION: Prelude has given me new eyes with which to see the vast, empty existence we call life. It has allowed me to percieve more than you or I could ever imagine.   I have now seen the face of god,   and he wept at the absolute majesty of what can really only be the end and beginning of a new age. He has rightfully submitted himself, as this creation of mortal men has towered above everything God himself has done. ORION: Prelude has begun humanity upon a path to beautiful absolution. I can not rest. Not until every soul of this wretched sepulcher we call Earth has been awoken by ORION: Prelude. It is impossible to tell where its gentle hand will lead us, but I am certain it will not be astray. I place my faith in thee, ORION: Prelude, as I know you will show me the release that mankind has been missing since its very roots.   May ORION rule forever more.    
1787	1	a	This is a 2-D physics, puzzles, shooter and platformer. BEEP is a Wall-E like robot kind that have a gun and a gravity like gun. You need to stack, pull and grab your way across three plantets with two sides to them each. Fight the KREEP and find out what is going on.  This is a 2-D platformer with puzzle and some shooting. You can throw your enemys at other enemys to kill them and some need more then your gun. Reload with E, This game is without voice acting and platforms will deliver the story.  This is a shortish cute game that is kinda low priced but if you fancy yourself a puzzler or want to get into it then this might be an easy entry path. For all ages, no blood. You got 8 hp, if you die another BEEP will take your place at the checkpoint. Even I managed to complete it 100 %. No achievements but you can complete it but there is no completon bonus. I hope you found this helpful. Have fun, enjoy and BEEP them all :)
1207	1	a	Fun game, tower defense w/FPS twist. I wish it was multiplayer though. Still worth it.
6429	1	a	I really recommand this game cuz' he has: -Action :which is very good at a shooter game cuz u can't just stay in a place and wait for the enemies , thats boring... -Sci-fi : Dinosaurs... Awesome. Whats more awesome? To play as a dinosaur. And this game. allows u to do this. -Graphic : From this pont , i can't say the graphic is the best of what i ever seen but i can say that this game has a little bit of a shooter game's graphic... Isn't like Counter Strike 1.6. with pixels. Anyway , the graphic is good. -Costumize : It would be boring if u could just look like a default character. Cuz m aybe u don't like how it looks and then... what are u doin'? Costumize it ( if the game allows u to do it ). Anyway this game has the costumize option ( so thats a point : the developers thinked at the players. ( That count as : You metter ) -And in finally...special powers : U saw that , if u played , u can fly sometimes or make urself invisible for a while.or.... I think i forgot the last one xD... Anyway , 'ORION:Prelude' thinked at the best. They allow u to be a lil bit powerful ... maybe more then dinosaurs sometimes.   *Sorry for bad english if there are some mistakes* *Sorry if u don't like this long argument* *Sorry for taking ur time while u readed this*
2400	1	a	This game was a ton of fun despite the metascore. XD
6028	1	a	A simple FPS with dinosaurs, what more could you want?
2885	1	a	controls are confusing, and it lags SOOOOOOOOO much for meh, but i dont dislike it. its really laggy, but i enjoy it...
5657	1	a	Although clunky and unresponsive at best, with repetitive gameplay blatant animation errors EVERYWHERE, it's a breath of air from the drones of modern military fps games left and right. Plus it's only a dollar so you can't really complain.
467	1	a	Surprisingly fun cross between Tower Defense style gameplay, Dungeon Keeper, and a first person shooter like Serious Sam.
3099	1	a	Now Right Off The Bat This Game Is Realy Laggy And Bad Quality Do Not Waste Your Money...UNLESS You Want An Amazing Game That Is Amazingly Entertaining If You Can Look Around The Lag Bugs And Bad game Quality (Now I Know That Sounds Pretty Bad But Im Going To Finish What I was Saying Just Trust Me) Then You Get An Amazing Time With Your Friends So If You Can Do All That Get This Game...Its Worth 1 Dollar And Just Remember 'Games Cannot Fail Only Developers Can'
1791	1	a	I bought it for low price and had no problems with this game.
3691	0	a	this game was better a year ago when it was alpha and barely ran. this is now terribad and in the span of an hour it crashed on me three times, i couldnt host a multiplayer game for anybody, let alone friends, and microtransactions. id rather watch The Kardashians than play this steaming dino poo pile
2416	1	a	Dinosaurs are awesome, so the laws of physics literally state that this game is awesome too.  Play it.
1539	1	a	Warp is a game reminiscent of the old Metal Gear series, but with Portal elements. A stealth game with teleporting features is a bit of an odd mix, and so whether you like this game will be entirely up to you. I found it entertaining, but after one playthrough, I think I'm good.
87	1	a	surprisingly fun - something you can play while you have your lunch
3479	0	a	tHIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!tHERE IS SO MUCH LAG AND IT IS LOW quality. 1/10
4500	1	a	Great fun, cool cartoony graphics, bugs seem to have been cleared up pretty neatly showing that the developers behind it care and are willing to support the game and its community.   It is extremely cheap so I do recommend buying a 4 pack to share with your mates as the most fun is offered in CO-OP with friends. :P overall, definitely get this game! :D
552	1	a	Really love the mix of tower defense and action :) And the humor makes it pretty funny. If you have seen the trailer of the game and you are hyped, then i most definatly recommend this game :D
1326	1	a	A good sequel, but not so good as the first game...
4771	0	a	This game, although cheap, is not worth 79p.
4392	1	a	Team Fortress with dinosaurs, spawningdinos/10 would play again
3228	1	a	Punched a T-Rex to death.  11/10 would punch again.
1493	1	a	This game is intresting with the mechanics and storyline and also after u get all the abilities u will need to discover some of them secrets which is awesome
2826	1	a	I know Jeff Goldblum and he says that this is the best game where you kill dinos and he is the best person to judge dino games because he is Jeff Goldblum knower of all things dino.    ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY JEFF GOLDBLUM!   Real review: This is the best game ever, I mean having the upgrade stations on one part of a map and atleast 20 seconds apart with a minute to get to them is the best idea for the best game ever.
3722	0	a	Killed some time on this game, so glitchy. I had fun though, guess it all comes down to who you play with.
2977	1	a	10/10 I cried for three whole weeks after I bought the game. This game is litterally my life, shrek is no longer my life this game has become my love as well, sorry shrek. This game has to be the best game ever with the dino blast and the dino chopper all going like 'pew pew pew pew' gotcha! take that you dinosaur scumbags! MURICA NEEDS ITS OIL SOME HOW â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ES. Must say I played for 30hours straight using a bucket to â¥â¥â¥â¥ in and drinking my own â¥â¥â¥â¥ to survive, was worth it just to finally kill some god damn dinosaur looking â¥â¥â¥ mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ers. I lied 20/10 would reccomended beat the hell out of that there call of â¥â¥â¥â¥o 3
1729	1	a	My friend got me this as a joke for Christmas.   It's actually a well made physics platformer with a surprising level of challenge.  If you enjoy platformers, buy it. If you don't enjoy platformers, it's so cheap you may as well try it.  I guess you could say it's pretty BEEPing good :^D
1306	1	a	Shank is like ramboo.  -fast paced game thats full of action , story is too short and quick to be judged , you feel that theres no story at all. -the artwork in this game is fairly decent. -this game is sort of too short , you may finish up with the main story in 4 hours~ -if you're intersted in action combos , trying different weapons and moves , you may like this game. -well , theres also multiplayer in it , which may extend the fun from this game to afew more hours.  In general , this game is not bad , not worth the full price i recommend buying it during sales or bundles. 6/10.
81	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this one. Just play couple of battles and you've pretty much seen it all. The game is tedious even if you manage to play it through in a couple of hours. The story is pretty indefferent: something about fantasy creatures roaming in Dark age Europe and mythic religious references. Sure if you're a fan of new card games, then go ahead and invest. Something new which get old pretty fast.
5535	0	a	Cs 1.6 all over again
986	1	a	Tower Defense meets Hack'n Slay Really funny to play and a tip for fans of Sanctum and Dungeon Defenders, traps can be a lot more difficult to choose and place cause each level requires different strategies. But compared to Dungeon Defenders too less possibilities to upgrade stuff and gain new one.
2136	1	a	It woths more than $9 but on sale with $0.49 tag. 100% WORTH. You don't need to spend much extra money , just head into a survival mode server and take out guns in the weaponary shop , bambambam , fun. It has potential to grow bigger.
3997	0	a	&gt;Last played February 21st 2014  As it should, and always will be.  I really have no idea what they added since then, but based on what other negative reviews have said, I don't think I have any other insightful comments to add, so I'll just a story if you want to read more.  I got this game in 2014, probably the 21st of february to be exact, all because someone I knew back then told me to get it to play with them. They really enjoyed playing this piece of tosh $1 arena dino shooter game at the time. Well I guess their taste in this game was indicative of them overall, garbage. The end.  Just play TF2, Dirty Bomb, any other F2P game besides this.
4409	1	a	I think this game is pretty fun, but I cant say that I like the devs. Most of the reviews that are negative have to do with the devs, just disreguard that stuff. This game is $1 This game is 100% worth $1 I wouldn't say that its worth $20 by a long shot
5624	0	a	Terrible, terrible. Developers stealing assets here.
4075	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
2689	1	a	This game is optimized worse than a giraffe for raising a baby. It runs terribly, looks MUCH worse than in the screenshots, dinosaurs are dumber than Donald Trump running for president, all of the sfx are ones I hear in flash games on kongregate, and the price is a couple dollars over what I would pay. Also, i'm reccomending so people actually see it.
4028	1	a	  even though i tried this game for abut half an hour while it was free i love this game there are a lot of dinos and cool weapons and to make this even better this game is really cheap.   Definitely better than it was in 2012
5383	1	a	Really nice and really fun! Game have great potential.
985	1	a	If you enjoy tower defense, you should dive into this very interactive 3D mass murder, the feeling of having set up a heap of traps to the limit of an unstoppable force, is priceless.
4479	0	a	the graffic's ar HORRIBLE AND TO MUCH LAG
6002	1	a	:)
5562	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ off
4739	1	a	10/10
49	1	a	7/10  A sort of RPG card playing game. A great time-killer and lazy repetitive game. It's one of those games that require one hand and is fun to come back to every once in awhile.
2522	1	a	ive played 7 minutes of this game, most broken thing on steam. 11/10
5148	0	a	The developer keeps re-releasing the same game under different names, and they steal assets from other games and then try to paint themselves as the victims. Plus, the developer goes around on Internet forums threatening to sue people for talking about those two facts. Complete scum.
4448	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
1147	1	a	kinda like Lord of the Rings 
4332	0	a	meh. It's ok
1144	1	a	It you like tower defence action games, you have to play this one!
2262	1	a	cool.
4528	1	a	Killed a stegosauraus by shooting it in the â¥â¥â¥â¥. 12/10 BEST GAME OF ALL TIME
11	1	a	Incredible game. You should pay up to $100 for this game.
1250	1	a	This was a really great game; dynamic gameplay, somewhat developed characters, and a variety of mobs to slice and dice. The traps are good, but I definitly fell into a pattern of which to use/which were the most useful. Definitly good, pick it up!
5116	1	a	best, good game, idled for cards
6007	1	a	Amazing Game! Is very replayable meaning you wont regret buying this game a week later. Plus you can kill a stegosaurus with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tank! In my opinion this game is right up there with killing floor, probably better. A must have!
1277	0	a	Its good fun, and not too hard. The only problem I have is the game getting stuck at a point (for me, the end of the first level on Katharsis) with no way to progress. It seems to be common and it's quite frustrating.
4948	1	a	Halo 2 meets dinosaur survival.  One of the trailers quotes this game is a mix of Halo, Jurassic Park, and Killing floor, Id say thats spot on. I think this is the most fun game Ive played in a while. I reccomend everybody play this game for a few hours. Its just pure joy, and its not to intensive. Im playing on a laptop and it still runs very smoothly.  10/10 play this game
5112	1	a	One of the fun and funniest game that comes with good price
3350	1	a	Mant people say this isn't a good game but it actually is. Give it a try and see how cool is to fight those dinosaurs with friends :D
4962	1	a	i would recomd ths game only if they put some new guns and maps but otherwise a fun and time killing game
1393	1	a	Quick Brawler - 4 hours to complete. Couldn't get the hang of all the button presses. B-
5985	1	a	It's being improved on, but as of now it's absolute fun with friends!
5379	1	a	Isn't tf2
5152	0	a	Never Did find any Giant Dino Turds.  Unless you count this game.
3463	1	a	Very few developers keep in mind what makes games fun but these folks are on the right track. Yeah, sure there are things needing improvement here and there but overall this game is F-U-N. It's old skool, it's ridiculous and cool at the same time. I've paid 60 bucks for games not even nearly as fun as this. My gaming buds and I find this title very pleasing to play and doesn't look half bad either :)
5696	0	a	Very bad game in my opinion and it shoud be free to play becouse its garbage
5923	1	a	I would recomend this masterpiece :)
557	1	a	Great game. Killing the orcs, ogres and the other momsters is fun using the variety of weapons, spells and traps. yeye! I have such good high scores too yeye!!!
615	1	a	Pretty nice game if you have little time. :)
4632	1	a	What Can You Say About Orion Dino Horde??? Well This Is All BUY IT
3654	1	a	I've spent countless hours playing this game.
630	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun. A bit short, I finished the game in about two days. Orcs Must Die! Definitely has the best twist on tower defense: third person.
2612	0	a	From a 100% honest reviewer:  Hi guys, this game wasn't too bad! The graphics were definately a bit underwhelming, especially the way the dinosaurs moved. However the gameplay was fun and easy to learn. I picked up pretty quickly and was able to play some fun rounds. However, it was slightly repetitve, and for me, it didn't really have any replay value. I wouldn't really play this game a lot.
5222	0	a	this made my balls itch !  never again ....
6451	1	a	10/10 so good. Me and my friends got cancer from it but soooo worth.
2437	0	a	It was a free weekend, and I wanted to see if it was as bad as people were saying. Words cannot describe how abysmal this game is. Supposedly the devs went through the game and fixed all the bugs.   Supposedly.  Honestly don't waste your time, and certainly don't waste your money.
606	1	a	sauron hates this game
1757	1	a	Really entertaining, especially if your looking for a random cheap game to play  10/10 dead robot stacking is fun  
3212	0	a	I 'played' this game for twenty minutes before I had enough.  Five minutes were spent in a solo game to test out graphics settings. Noticed the AI was pretty terrible, but I figured it was just easy because It was only the second wave. Anyways I didn't want to make any judgements about it until I tried out the multiplayer.   So I navigated through the buggy menu for fifteen minutes. I tried to join multiple different servers. I restarted the game several times trying to get it to work, and I could not join a single game. It's really frustrating to have to give a game a negative review because I legitimately could not access the multiplayer (Which is the only draw to the game in this case) Rather than on the merits of the gameplay itself.   I could have probably had a better time smoking cat hair out of the dollar I spent on the game.  Still better than Infestation Survivor stories.
4802	1	a	For 89 cents per copy, the game is totally worth it. If only for the ability to shoot dinosaurs- its fantastic. Despite a plethora of bugs, its the best dinosaur fighting game yet. That being said, the developers are pretty marginal as a business and studio. But for the price it is, the game is amazing.
4951	1	a	-Installed the game because my friend said it wasn't as â¥â¥â¥â¥ as it was before  -Joined a game  -Halloweene themed  -Fight a couple of dinosaurs and having fun  -Boss battle  -Friend says it's a T rex  -Same friend suddently starts screaming and yelling â¥â¥â¥â¥ we can't understand  -Keeps repeating 'PUMPKIN!! PUMPKIIIIN!!!''  -Turns out boss is a giant pumpkin that throws you in the air  -Pretty intense battle with jetpacks and a lot of reviving  -Boss has still almost full health  -Teleports on a mountain and rains giant fireball on us, killing us.  10/10 Spooked out of my mind.  (Actual game is pretty fun tho if you get with friends. Kind of a shame that the whole character customization is a cash grab)
3839	0	a	nothing new...
4586	1	a	what
3537	1	a	This was such a mess after release xD But 3 years later and for a price of 1$ defenetly worth it. This is the best example to change a hughe mess into something decent and fun. See it as a Dino Survial shooter with vehicles and really nice maps. Grab it up for 0.49-1$ you cant do anything wrong for that price.
5931	1	a	My first play on orion prelude: &gt;enter the game &gt;take a weapon &gt;be taken by a pterodactyl &gt;dies 10/10 would fly with pterodactyl express again.
5260	0	a	This is fantastic game ..if you are seven-eight years old
752	1	a	Not bad, about 10 hours of campaign game play in it.
3269	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
5283	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
77	1	a	Good game, but much too short.  The game has a good premise, good storyline, great mechanics and is fun and at times challenging to play. The only downside is that the main storyline of the game is much too short. I finished the game in two nights and was really left wanting more.  Having said that, if you can find the game on sale it still is a good value. 
5499	0	a	I found that this games graphics were lacking and the humans were underpowered and the dinos extremely overpowered also the weepons were very unbalanced
4697	1	a	Favorite game.  10/10  Maximum fun achieved with a group of friends.
3020	1	a	Orion Prelude is fun very fun game overall and the price is even better this game has by my opinnion the best developpers a game can ever want.  I have some slight requests for the devs. :  1. A graphical improvement wouldn't hurt considering the fact that we gamers, in 2015, have powerfull PC's. 2. Character customization system (a bit like the TF2 system but less complicated maybe). 3. Customizable weapons (Scopes, muzzles, etc.)  I know its a big demand but im sure our caring developpers wouldnt mind making huge (maybe) 3 year celebration update with these cool new addons.  Thank you
184	1	a	Combining a tower defense game with a shooter.... awesome! It is also a highly polished and humurous game with tons of replayability.
2130	1	a	It's fun and it costs less than a dollar. Sell some cards and buy this game. Trust me, it's worth it. Just make sure you have some friends to play with too!
4453	0	a	Ugly. Awful. Bad gameplay. Waste of time. Sorry I gave this game a shot and it's just bad. Looks cool and fun at first however it's not.
5547	0	a	  Someone needs to build a wall around this game and make the Devs pay for it.
6400	0	a	Pve normal and PVP only dinos vs ppl . Bad game not worth
3623	1	a	Left 4 Dinosaurs is a wonderful game
3653	1	a	Jetpacks, Tanks, Helicopters, what do we need more?  ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game which you won't be able to stop playing this. First few hours will make you flustered since this game does not provide you any tutorials. Especially, fighting with big-sized dinosaurs when you are a newb will drive you crazy. However, after you finish learning how to play this game(It'll take no longer than 3 hours), then the real fun begins.  Teamwork is the key point of the game. Without it, you and your mates can die before you even hit the round 5. The great point of this game is, 'teamwork' and 'dino' can create a great action movie. You and your squads will face hundreds of dinos coming toward you. After your squad captures the checkpoint. Most of cases Hummer style vehicle equipped with a machine gun will be given to you. Then, somebody will drive while others take the shotgun, or grab the machine gun and feel like his playing Call of Duty.  Not only because my English sucks, but it's just hard to explain all the positive elements which this game will give to you.  9.5 / 10.0  P.S. It doesn't mean the actual graphic is bad, but screenshots uploaded on the steam store page is way better than the actual graphic.
2160	0	a	I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.  They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.  Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.  Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!  Enemies? All the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.  Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with onomathopeyas.  Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is 'the most fantastic game' anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. 'So cool I love it'? Now that's a cool quote. 'The metacritic score is misleading'? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.  Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're: -A hipster -A game collector -A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.
3614	1	a	still better than Halo 4
5863	1	a	11/10 the voice acting is god-like and the game is cheap as â¥â¥â¥â¥ recommended
3831	1	a	good game to play with and a decet amount of people play it but it lacks in weapons.
2966	1	a	Got it on sale for .49 cents. Played for 2 hours and it was a blast. So far that about 25 cents to the hour. 10/10 would give two quarters again to get this game. Don't even think about it, just get it.
5899	1	a	Best $1 I've ever spent! Good graphics, good co op, a lot of game modes and maps... and a fantastic price
5548	0	a	This looks and plays great!  Wait what do you mean this isn't an XBox Live Indie Game? Oh... Oh no.
2478	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
1072	1	a	Probably the most addicting game I have ever played, up there with Star Ocean 2. It's a combination tower defense/3rd person shooter, in which you kill thousands and thousands of Orcs, along with Ogres, Kobolds, Hellbats, etc. Best of all it's extremely cheap, and will give you countless hours of entertainment!
5792	1	a	Basically Halo maps copied and pasted with a ton of dinosaurs added in. The fact that it's 59p makes that okay. 
289	1	a	Probably the best tower defence/trap defence game ever.
3969	1	a	First of all. some of the latest haters are a little bit stupid cause they didnt noticed (like some big magazines ) that THIS IS NOT THE GAME WITH THE DMCA PROBLEMS. Most of them played the game for only 0.5 hours. Orion prelude isnt a bad game and ORION (2016) also.  And something i also want to say:'Activision' always have problems with everything and everyone.  I played this game long enough to know that the most haters never played the game more than 10 minutes. This is my second positive review.
4457	1	a	addicted with this game :)
5039	0	a	Bad gameplay, horrible graphics, even worse optimization (I have 2x the reccomended specs!) And the lensflares are horrible, they burn my eyes!
3470	1	a	Simply Outstanding, the game co-produced by Peter Jackson really emits a sense of feeling and character to the player. The narrative is excellent, one in which all games should follow. The scenes have so much depth to them and when jimmie was molested by a pterodactyle i may of even shed a tear. The attachments that you grow with the players is like no other game i've ever experienced. The title of this game is extremly misleading, i thought it was going to be a wrestling game but i found out it was no other than a RSPCA animal saving simulator. The crew is incharge of rescueing the remaining dinosaurs of southern uzbekistan. One of the standout scenes of this game was when the raptor had recieved a splinter in his foot. You could see that the team were really doing their job, helping out with the local wildlife. Not only is this game compelling in both its narrative and its gameplay it also manages to be one of the must humour-filled experiences of my life. I couldnt help emitting into a cacophony of laughter clawing my eyes out in hysterics, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ uncontrollably. There was even one stage when me and my friends where laughing so hard we liquified and proceeded to melt into a puddle together amongst feces, urine and blood. Samuel L Blackson also makes a cameo aswell as amanda todd, trying to join the crew. I still cant believe this was only 10 dollars, aswell as the extremly raving metascore it recieved. This is definataly my GOTY for 2012, and i have already logged over 2,300 hours. This game has shifted me as a person into a new form, and provided me with enjoyment of monumental levels. Im very grateful that the developers removed dino pubes in patch 3 or this game wouldnt be as enjoyable. With a trilogy in the makes and a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, aswell as its extraordinarily amazing soundtrack produced in studio by mozart and beethoven and snoop dogg (snoop lion). Aswell it is now sponsored by burger king, with their new Onion-Rings-In-Oil-Now item and Mountain dew's patented Dino Dew. This Is As Good As It Gets. 100/100
3065	1	a	Great multiplayer, even though the game's engine isn't very good, its still pretty sweet for the $500+ pc.
1973	1	a	This game has got to be one of the best I have ever played. The sheer attention to detail is quite evident. How challenging this game is makes it even more enjoyable. 10/10
3451	1	a	You can kill T-Rex'es with a Lightsaber. You can also get eaten by them. 9,8/10
1846	1	a	In my opinion this game is really cool puzzley like and cool adventure also it gets 10/10 from me :)
1911	0	a	honestly this is how i think of the game the name literally explains it: BEEPhole              bad graphics bad music bad hub good half life rip 1/10 ign
3743	0	a	1 of the worthless games i ever played too bad i cant get my mony back
429	1	a	Great! Pretty tempted to buy the second one too.
1434	1	a	A good platforming blast with humour.
6457	1	a	In support of the recent success and new sale all I can say is.... buy it.  There's only 2 things I regret. That I didn't pay more to such awesome developers because I bought it during their first $1 sale. And that my play time isn't higher.   If you have a steam account and I know you do because your reading this.... you need to buy this for $1... twice.... maybe more  There's no excuse not to.... Seriously, what else are you waiting on?  &gt;=)
3668	0	a	This is not one game.... this is a lot of games (and even movies)  Weapons : Cod AW/BO3 T-Rex : Primal Carnage Helmets : Star Wars (Boba Fett, Kylo Ren)  it was also released twice....  source:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
2066	1	a	Great for kids. Its like portal without the portals...and for kids. Id say 12 and under more than likely. I couldnt handle the cuteness after 20 minutes
5528	0	a	its s h i t dont buy this game
865	1	a	Very addicting and fun.
3047	1	a	I wasn't too interested in this game, but a friend bought a 4-pack for like $3. After playing the game, however, I can say this game is awesome. Its so much fun driving around yelling 'GTA MOTHA â¥â¥â¥â¥AS' while mowing down dinos. Some of the guns feel good to shoot, there are plenty of perks and guns to buy, and some of the maps are HUGE!  Unfortunately, I do have a couple problems with this game. Although there are 3 classes in the game, but I feel it is really neccessary to play the assault, due to the fact that dinos will quicky overwhelm you unless you can jetpack out. Walking around is not really a thing you can do, especially while being attacked from LITERALLY all direction. Also, vehicles can be overpowered (you can disable them though), and some of the gamemodes (that I have played), while fun, seem a bit lacking (too short usually). Some of these probelms may disappear with a larger group though (I've only played with 4), so keep that in mind  Overall, this is a really fun game though. If you think killing dinosaurs or flying around with jetpacks while killing dinosaurs is something you would like to do, then I would reccomend this game, especially if its on sale.  7.5/10
3931	0	a	Dang it. why did I let myself get fooled by the trailer. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. And it looks so GOOD in the trailer, lightsabers, mechs, dinosaurs. sounds like a recipe for fun.  Unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt fun. guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt fun. No tutorial what so ever isnt fun. microtransactions arent fun. And gameplay elements that are terrible.   I gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a human is run right at them. No way to out manouver, and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds.. Even as a human the game felt grindy and unpolished. You can unload TONS of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a bad looking blood splatter. Now, I don't usually care if graphics are bad. But I want my bulltes to line up with my fire, I want to not be the wrong colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning, I want what feels like a complete game for my money.  At this tage, I have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver.   EDIT: Ok they have recently made an update that seems to follow a particular theme, that theme, is that the devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport, adn are constantly improving the game, basically all the issues I covered here have been fixed. so the game is ok now.
2093	1	a	Always wanted to know what would happen if you rammed a jeep into T-Rex  11/10

4707	1	a	catchy game!!!
322	1	a	A little rough around the edges but a fun little td type action game.
38	1	a	 https://youtu.be/v-L9C1_TE8U   In a dark medieval world where danger lurks around every corner, the only way to survive is to play Poker! FOR YOUR LIFE!  Long story short, if you liked Puzzle Quest, but wanted to play it by building poker hands instead this game is for you.
5619	0	a	This just does not work, is not complete, may be labelled a tech demo or concept draft. Certainly it's not a game. May be jolly in 2014.
1293	1	a	Do you wanna gut your way through a variety of foes continuously with your shank until they drop to the floor? Or Would you prefer to juggle them in the air with your machete? No?...Well then how about shredding them to bits with your chainsaw? Still not satisfied? Ok, lets throw a handgun or two into the mix? Nawww...What you really want is a shotgun, right? And maybe a grenade to go with your molotove cocktail? If you still aint smiling at the thought of all this, well, then...you my friend dont know what a REAL game is...  Shank 2 is an awesomely fun, yet challenging game; a veritable mesh of some of the more old-school platforming experiences mixed with the new. And if the campaign aint enough for you, and you have a friend that has some free time, then crank up the Survival mode and try and protect yo stash together against countless waves of enemies...and uh...zombies from time to time. Watch as you quickly lose track of time being sucked in by the thrill and enjoyment :D  Oh...and I forgot to mention that there is also a female character, complete with her own set of weapons and arsenal too? Yeah, thats right, and she's hawt...so go and spend that $9.99 you cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Cause there aint many games out there that deliver the same punch as this one for such a low price. Peace :D  
1050	1	a	Delightful, dorky, rambunctious fun. It can get frustrating at times when you lose â but naturally thatâs part of the game. I will admit I am disappointed that levels I am doing exceptionally well on seem to be over in a few heartbeats, so thatâs somewhat disappointing. Nonetheless (and particularly when on sale), itâs worth considering.
2373	1	a	this is the game of the year, if you dont have this you might as well just give up. buy the 4 pack just for yourself and have pride in having 4 copies of this game. dont trade any of them away. truly a masterpiece of our time 7 flamingos/5 flamingos.
6275	0	a	The only thing that i truly interesting about this game is the mysterious uninstall button. I wonder what happens when i push it?
4692	1	a	So I tried the free week with this game, its worth a dollar, but I wouldn't pay much more because the dev's are double dipping. Their selling you a game for $14.99, and than charging you for content in game using their in game shop.  Gameplay is really fun, it plays like a really big mod from a game like halflife 2.....its main downfall is lack of players really, thier co-op gameplay is pretty interesting, it feels like a mix of tribes and halflife 2  If you haven't tried this one and are bored, the co-op is worth a try.
3486	1	a	This game has some serious future. Only read new reviews, old ones are from the Beatdown period.  Ingame purchases aren't needed because you can get as much points just by playing.  Graphics are amazing, and if you put low-number-of-bugs besides, this is a hell of a game.  9/10, would recommend to everyone.
6157	1	a	One of the few examples of Early Access done right I'm still confused as to how such a total piece of garbage became so great 
5594	1	a	If you think this game is bad, it's not. It is life, it is better than all the steam games combined. If you ain't talking ORION Dino Horde I don't wanna talk!
4374	0	a	I do like this game but not as good as everone said (i got it for $0.50) but its ok i guess....... 5.6/10
1523	1	a	Interesting
1774	1	a	I still remember when the game came out back in 2011. I loved BEEP so much. I was pretty yough back then, aroud 8 years and a half. I prayed to BEEP every night hoping he would come visit me. My brother once caught me in the act and called me a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. On one faithful night BEEP did come visit me, he came through my window with his jet propulsion system. His tractor beam was quite big, it hurt so much but I do it for BEEP. In the end BEEP gave me all the anti matter.  All of that to say: 10/10 would BEEP again
2238	0	a	Pay real cash for in-game items for a game which you already paid for?...Really?...Might as well make it free to play then.
4847	1	a	I am able to pursue my dreams as a dinosaur hunter. I also punched a T-rex in the face. My life goals are complete.
3634	1	a	Awesome game! Work together and kill some dinos.
4110	1	a	It's a good game .
523	1	a	Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   Awesome single-player 'tower defense' (change 'tower' to 'trap'), very polished, balanced, real pure fun and very charming characters.
453	1	a	Hours of fun, recommend especially if you enjoy tower defense games.
2832	1	a	why do you keep changing the name?
2131	0	a	I'm torn. For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there. That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...  No.  The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun. Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc). Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!  That's not to say the game is /bad/. Are there performance issues? Yes. Is the attention to detail lacking? Absolutely. Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while? You betcha. But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends. That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of 'skating' over terrain), and a linear level experience.  For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app. Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing. I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.
4419	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
2357	1	a	Killing Dino's have never been so much fun!!! Teamwork is great and all... but killing dino's with tanks and what not just takes the cake!
2009	1	a	I got this game for 19 cents i made my money back in 5 min thanks to the steam tradeing cards xD. So buy it
2191	1	a	This game is honestly great, you'll buy it for the Horde mode with the dino's and stuff and when i got bored one day i didnt even realise that they're other game modes i could play! This game is worth it!
1119	1	a	This game is very, very entertaining, the objective of the game is to kill orcs, gnolls, kobolds and ogres before they reach the end of the level. We could say this is a light game as is easy to win, however, for getting the perfect mark is another history. Is a strategy game as you can choose which traps, spells and special guardians to use for each level and you can upgrade them as you got better marks in each level. However, if you play in the nightmare mode, the strategy gives places to your skills as everything will change and will be very challenging to finish the game, and worse if you try to get a perfect mark in each level.  More is not enough to say, the game is very addictive, sarcastic history, and probably will be enjoyed by everyone. Thought is a good idea to get all the DLC in one single bundle as will help you. 
5246	0	a	A steaming, gigantic, dynosaur TURD!  Want to kill hordes of brutal enemies? Play killing floor... You love dynos? Go to a museum or watch discovery channel...   Please, for your own sake, STAY WELL CLEAR FROM THIS GARGANTUAN PILE OF DYNO CRAP!!!
1383	1	a	The Shank2 coop mode has been my top couch coop game with my girlfriend to date.
3564	1	a	A first person arcade, survival style shooter versus dinosaurs :D It feels like Halo 1 with dinosaurs in it :)
1395	1	a	This game is really awesome  Sometimes its really hard to catch because many details on a 2D games
291	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
827	1	a	A fun and awesome Tower Defense game, has plenty of strategic oppertunities and is really fun 10/10
204	1	a	Easy to learn and hard to master. Very fun and flexible to meet a lot of different play styles.
1776	1	a	Imagine a space colony star trekking with rovers from planet to planet, collecting cores and annihilating resisting inhabitants, only to deny the laws of physics with said rovers. That is BEEP. I still wish it came with a horn I could honk with ingame.
3246	1	a	Pretty sick
2969	0	a	The worst game I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Not even worth the $1 its on sale for.
5968	1	a	great raarrrr action some of graphcs dump than priminal carnage some of better.
5603	0	a	Cancer
4285	0	a	If you like broken games that uses about 100% of your GPU and still looks like crap then this is the game   for you.   It's like Goat Simulator, only that this game is unintentionally bad.
6049	0	a	Not worth the $1.50 i paid for it. Although it presents a decent concept, it feels unfinished with LOW 2d graphics on small dinosaurs and a lack of both game mode variety and gun textures.
5367	1	a	I only love cod zombies and the survival mode is a good alternative to zombies.
2839	1	a	I have given this game 2 reviews already but i kept coming back after the updates, the last update did this game justice, Spiral Games finally stepped up and listened to their fans and players. At first i did like the game, nice concept but then after they redid it, the optimization and performance was awful, and when i mean awful. The animations were just sad, i mean the way the raptors *chomped* on you was too odd and sad. It looked like someone eating cereal while having a stroke. But after the recent update this is what i must say.  1. The performance has been hugely improved, i can now play at 60 FPS without my pc tanking it.  2. The visuals have improved greatly, Dynamic Lights have been given a meaning however being annoying sometimes.  3. The animations have improved slightly, they still look clunky, specially the spino's, when theirs too many raptors it starts to breakdance lol, it looks funny but it could be improved.  Overall the game is actually enjoyable now, just becareful on joining a server where the host is from another country, you WILL lagg. This has to be fixed ASAP. Fun gameplay, great weapons (specially the bow, my god that bow is fun) and thank you for listening Spiral Games.   7/10 Fun, Great concept, Killing dinos with a bow while using a jetpack trying to avoid being eating while not dropping to a pool of raptors is enjoyable now.
3327	1	a	Personally, I think this game is one of the best co-op games I have seen..., even though the price is incredibly cheap.
5585	1	a	Have you ever wanted to feel the sensation of stepping on a rusty nail with your bare foot? Then this is the game for you. I tell ya, Oreo Prelude was a great way to curb my hunger. Unfortuantely, it really spoiled my appetite as I played this at 5:30 PM and I normally want to eat dinner at 6:00 PM, because of this I was unable to enjoy my pizza ravioli platter. The milk mechanics in this game are almost real but in the end you just remember that it's all an illusion: like actual equality in America. Some people may be lured in by the low price of this game, but I'd say you're better off going to see Pixar's 'The Good Dinosaur' because the word 'good' is in the title and will never be used in conjunction with this game, also it's always great to lather your hand with butter and rub one out during a kids' movie. 6/10
3568	1	a	I think this game gets too much hate. It's an ok game.
2758	1	a	Its a good game, but no Malaysia server, so if you about to play this game, make sure you live in the right region, to of course,avoid lag.  Pros: Epic graphic Massive multiplayer Overpowered weapons and upgrades  Bads: High RAM Usage Some badass dinasour will camp outside your spawn  Infinite/10 will play again if theres Asia Server  -Modified Review 11.13.16
4196	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
737	1	a	First Person 'Trap' Defense at its finest. Slaying hordes of orcs is so much fun. 8/10
5337	1	a	Best game I've ever played.
390	0	a	Poor controller support and lack of autofire made playing this game physically impossible for me.
3253	1	a	This does have a feel similar to halo. Haven't gotten very deep into it yet but it also reminds me of playing Turok back in the day! Seems like a great game to play with friends!
297	1	a	This is like a tower defense game, in which you build catapults, and traps to kill ogres to prevent them from reaching their objective. Really entertaining and challenging.
6272	1	a	The dinos are there. That is all I have to say. When they get in your sight all you really want is to slay them all with no mercy. 11/10
1811	1	a	BEEP is a very fun and Enjoyable Platformer Game But I Would Prefer it Even More if there was Controller Support but that might just be me!
3756	1	a	I Love To RolePlay With My Friends On Here. I Also Like Conquest. But I Wish They Could Add A Bit Better Stuff To The Dinosaurs...... Espeically The Pteradactyl And Raptor. WEIRD FACT: I Met All Of My Good Friends On This Game. :P
3425	1	a	this game is underated but buy it on a sale
208	1	a	Super-fun 1-player beat-em-up / tower-defence game.
1666	0	a	I have no idea what the point of this game is about. no story, it's only a design idea.
3692	1	a	very very fun game 
4891	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. No instructions on how to get started or what you're supposed to do.
3157	1	a	This game might be one of the best value games on the Steam store. I would call it a mix of Halo and Counter-Strike with Dinosaurs. For the most part the vehicles are very cool. I like the aircraft and the mech in particular, though the jeep feels kind of clunky. There is a nice variety of maps to play and they are rendered very nicely. The guns are where it's really fun. I just can't get enough of the fully automatic shotgun. The big dinosaurs are tough to take down and it's rewarding when you do. I definitely enjoy this game a lot more than what I thought I would. And for a regular price of $1 you just can't go wrong with this, assuming you like shooters.
3543	1	a	Played this during the free weekend. Not a good game by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can grab a few friends it quickly becomes a very silly and entertaining game.
1603	0	a	not really worth your time, soo many better TD games on steam alone, not forgetting on sites like kongregate
3303	1	a	For how inexpensive this game is, and for how many free give-a-ways they've done with this game, you'd think it's absolutely terrible, but this game is actually one of the most fun multi-player games out there. Everything is cooperative, the gameplay is fun, the leveling system is okay, the people who play this aren't absolutely toxic, and the game in general isn't that difficult. Also I'm one of the highest level people in this game so I have major streed cred amongst the players on this game which automatically gives this game a 10/10.  8/8 m8 gr8 I r8.
4041	1	a	Actually reason it lagged due to video settings my bad turn them down if you don't have a very good pc.
6363	1	a	Nice Game Devs it Suprised me in so much Ways Cod Wouldnt Thanks for giveing me an FPS Title that i'll love
1572	1	a	A solid tower defense game. Set in WWII, first as the Allies in the first campaign, then as the Axis during the second campaign. This is a fixed path tower defense game, meaning the enemies will always follow certain roads or channels and you have to place towers along those paths. The land and sea paths use the same towers, with Anti-Air towers specifically for the specific areas that have air raids. The graphics are fine for an iPhone port. The sound is forgettable explosions. The challenge is at about the right level. The early levels will be fairly simple to pass and not too hard to perfect, while the later stages will challenge you to even survive them.
6175	1	a	A lot of fun for a $1 game. Basically feels like halo ce mixed with jurassic park.
1593	0	a	I like TD games, so I picked up this one. Turns out it wasn't the best decision, as I only made it to the 4th level, then got bored. Why?  - Very few towers, with no upgradeability in missions, so you basically end up building the same towers over and over again each map. - Upgrades between missions are just boring and laziliy done. - Clunky controls - hitboxes of buttons weren't where they're supposed to be. I actually had to click multiple times press an OK button, increase or lower game speed etc. - Boring waves. I have played other TD titles that appealed to me with the first mission. But here it just feels that you play the same tactics each level, fighting off almost identically looking waves of enemies.  Overall the game feels like a first try of an indie studio at tower defense where they lacked the focus to reiterate their game design and do sufficient testing. Or just another lazy mobile port. Whichever is the case, I recommend going for other titles, as there are enough good TDs out there.
334	1	a	Its actually not bad
2607	1	a	Best Coop Game that i have played in a while
2229	1	a	Really cool game tbh. Looks cheap bad etc... BUt truly its a great game with a bit of call of duty in it and some nice graphics really cool ideas and creative!
2505	0	a	Probably the worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing, seriously not even worth 0.99 cents.
160	1	a	Overall a good game for slaughtering Orcs. Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.  The cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way. Considering the purpose of this game, I would say this is one of the best Indie games I've played in a while and I look forward to playing Orcs Must Die! 2 as well.
3276	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.
4445	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
2719	1	a	s'alright.
3994	0	a	WARNING THIS IS JUST ME RANTING ABOUT HOW â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND UNFINISHED THIS GAME IS.  The rant: This game is a cheaply made clone of halo trying to be original by throwing in some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaurs. At first I was excited when I booted up the game and played for a few minutes, 'aww yeah this is fun' then it hit me these guns all feel like toy guns that shoot little plastic balls and feel really underwelming. so you are either shooting at enemy players that all look like a ridiculous version of Zero from borderlands 2 but with more LED lights glued to their suits or you are shooting some stupid as â¥â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs. It is full of bugs, glitches and this game should of at least been finished before they released it. Oh wait this is the finished product, let me just shove that Â£0.59 up my â¥â¥â¥. Oh and all the maps are big open planes with a few rocks and if you're lucky a puddle of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing water.  The pros: This game would be okay if you were playing it with friends for less than 30 minutes before deciding to go back on PAYDAY 2 because all your friends you were playing with have killed themselves.  Thanks for reading, now im going to go play with my balls.
1109	1	a	This is a fun, action-oriented tower defense game with crisp graphics and good action. I recommend this to anyone.
4572	1	a	THIS GAME SUCKS. I PLAYED 5 HOURS AND I DON'T LIKE THIS. IT CAN IT MY NUTS. WHY SO BAD? WHY? PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME! PLEASE!!!
2617	1	a	Mmm...nice game!
2168	1	a	10/10. Would shoot baby dinosaur in the face in front of dinosaur family again.
3509	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
2075	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun.
1333	1	a	This game is awesome. Test yourself to see if you like it. One point for every question you answer with yes: Do you like 2d scrollers? Do you like monstrous combo moves? Do you like a good story?  1. You may or may like this 2. You will probably like this 3. You need this game 4+ Stop cheating. This is why we can't have nice things!
5718	0	a	this game is built for labour
3683	1	a	Honestly for the price you will easily get your money's worth. This game isn't going to way you on graphics necessarily but it has so many game modes and enough jokes and craziness to make it worthwhile.
4858	1	a	i love every thing in this game i givce it a rate of 19/10
1036	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played... No, I'm lying about that, it isn't... But it is a nice idea for a game and hell yeah it's funny. The only thing that is missing - level creator. I would probably have around 200 hours of it right now if it did.
5450	0	a	Now that it is free for a week you should definitely try it out. Afterwards, you can safely claim you have played the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. Jesus F**king Christ, this is absolutely garbage. Giving this game a 1/10 should be considered too much praise.
255	1	a	Not as good as Orcs Must Die 2! But still a really good game overall :)
99	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
349	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
4952	0	a	PLS, Make me a favor, and don t buy this game, it s a poor â¥â¥â¥â¥
6309	1	a	Really fun, decent quality, decent price and I like how you were making fun of your older game, sooooo....  keep up the good work!
1143	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a real gem of an indie game. It offers a creative take on the tower defense genre with plenty of options to approach each challenge. The mixture of strategy and action game elements coupled with tight controls flow together very well, leaving you with one very satisfying experience. The game also has a good sense of dark humor that, while it may get repetitive at some points, has yet to come across as annoying.  All in all, I highly recommend this game. If you love the tower defense genre you shouldn't think twice about getting it. The game offers a great experience that is well worth the price and is still fun to play again and again.
2647	1	a	One of the most fun co-op games i have played in a while and with still more content coming out this year!
5644	0	a	This is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game i have ever played
3514	0	a	the only fun thing to say about this game is to say how bad it is.
3071	1	a	Kill a dinosaur  Kill a dinosaur with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends while fighting other teams Kill many dinosaurs without friends while fighting everyone in free for all Kill humans as dinosaurs Kill many humans as dinosaurs Kill humans while being a dinosaur who realizes his enemy is in the wrong time frame and who actually should be working together to find a way back to a safe dinosaurless environment rather than killing each other to have a bigger base  Careful for FaZe Rex BTW, he'll rek you with a rock like it's an illcam trickshot 8/10 for $1 7/10 if it was $10
5627	0	a	It's not as bad as I thought it would be but that does not make it good... It seems like they copied mechanics from every other game ever but failed miseralbly.
4174	0	a	Avoid this game. Broken beyond repair and it's just no fun this way. Had some hopes for this game as a fun survivor shooter, but broken mechanics, overwhelming amount of bugs make this game unplayable
2774	1	a	Ok it is sooo broke but thats what the fun of it is, also there are jetpacks!  I will say get it, BUT ONLY IF ON SALE FOR LIKE $1  Because even if it is funny it is still a rather unfinished and badly programed game. But with good mate it can be very fun good time waster  4/10 for me
4889	1	a	i hate this 
3284	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
6327	1	a	A pretty decent and fun game  8.5/10
6434	1	a	This game is worth so much more than the ticket price. It offers a very acceptable cell-shaded graphics style that works well for it. The maps are large and varied. The dinosaurs look great. The game handles like you'd expect an arena FPS to handle. All in all, I have to give props to the developers for sticking with their original concept and turning it into a fun party arena survival game.  TLDR: Fun shooter.
717	1	a	The most fun game about genocide ever made.
1340	1	a	Fast, responsive, quick, deadly  SHANK 2 M O T H E R â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ E R
1152	1	a	Murdering thousand of stupid orcs with gory traps? What's not to love?
1288	1	a	Shank 2 its very good game, like shadows dancer, metal slug, final fight or other retro games but with more best graphics design,best game play.... very good time..so cool...so fun..
6159	1	a	Shooting dinos with big guns - almost the best way to let off some steam. Second to having sexual intercourse.
6090	1	a	It's a little confusing at first i spawned and was immediately getting chased by a t-rex and about4 raptors and was eaten immediately but this game is still awesome nd makes for some epic moments.
608	1	a	A Very addictive game from where I have played it. The controls are simple and the maps are different and fun. A must-have
496	1	a	Good game. Worth the 5$ I spent at the time. It'll get frustrating, though. Buy it for the lolz.
472	1	a	A rather fun and fast-paced 'trap defense' game. It can feel a bit repetitive over time, though.
2025	1	a	BEEP is a fun adventure type platformer    The levels are nicely designed, and can be completed somewhat easily. If you are trying to obtain all the antimatter particles, it becomes quite a bit harder.    While the graphics are not realistic, they fit in with the games design very well.     The visuals are unique and fun.    Solid platforming engine, no bugs glitches or clips that I could find.  Overall, it is very well done. I highly recommend picking this game up, and for less than the cost of a move, you will get hours and hours of enjoyment.
3126	0	a	I was able to buy 1 game and my ma said she pay for the game... so I decided to buy a cheap ugly game... ITS THIS GAME!  The Framerate issues make it impossible to play,every one who plays it is a jerk,the weapons are terrible and take all day to kill a raptor, A RAPTOR!!!  All the 'LEVEL UP QUICK!' Levels too, DONT HELP! When I saw this game I was at first like,'Ohmagawd Dinosaur game' *sees price* 'oh its a bad game :( '  This My fellow gamers on steam is what we call... 'A waste of money' I-I-I just want my money back... Or My soul.
4638	1	a	i'd say 4 hours of fun was worth AT LEAST $0.99
4940	1	a	ORION is a great game, I love it so much!
3239	1	a	A good survival game featuring defending a base against a wave of dinosaurs, capturing outposts, using vehicles to explore, buy different guns and much more. There are many different game modes to play and many different maps, my favorites are the conquest ones.  The graphics are good and the game runs smooth. The Level system looks pretty cool where you edit your loadouts but I'm not sure on how it works yet so I can't really review that.  All you need to know is you can shoot dinosaurs in the face...  7/10
5035	1	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics but is funish
3226	1	a	bought the game for the cards....   Then I joined a game and had a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blast... This is what happens when unreal has wild S . E. X with jurassic park lol. the combat seems pretty smooth some bugs here and there but what do you expect from a 1 dollar game. Was shocked that the player base is pretty decent with full lobbys in game.   I rate this game a 7/10 best damn dollar i ever spent in my life
1509	0	a	I hate when I need to loging to Origin while I'm playing a game I bough in Steam. I did it... Now I think I can go back to play Portal - it is way better!  
314	1	a	Wow, the tower defense titles these days actually improve on what is already a fun game genre. In Orcs Must Die you control a warmage, in third person view. So instead of building traps in an isometric sort of view, you now run around setting up traps and actively killing enemies with your character. There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun. Other than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts. Only downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel. Don't let that stop you from buying it though !  [Rating: 87/100]
6233	1	a	This is a fun game, and I only play Singleplayer except one time. But there are a few problems. Pros: -Fun game Multiplayer or singleplayer Cons: -Laggy to record. I was getting below 10 FPS, while on games like Portal or Terraria I have at least 40 FPS.
3146	1	a	10/10 -IGN  'Like Skyrim with dinosaurs.'
58	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
2639	1	a	Very enjoyable game, if you are playing it with a budie on co-op mode :D
5021	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
1009	1	a	+ Pretty good fun  - But little bit short  80/100
1348	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
6106	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the face, and then t-bag it. Buy this game.
3746	0	a	boring
3120	0	a	I mean its kinda fun, but its just terribly made. Really badly done, choppy animations. The textures are muddy and bland, but some of the bigger dinos look good. You fight wave after wave the same way in the same area so it gets repetetive very fast. The weapons all handle like old school doom guns, along with the iffy hitboxes it just makes for a boring experience. After playing Primal Carnage(buy it), this game just doesnt have any appeal to me. I really couldnt recommend it, even for $1.
5219	1	a	tfrdxcfgh
217	1	a	who wants more traps? I do! I do!
1602	1	a	This is a fun and worthy tower defense game.
4428	1	a	ayy, thats pretty good, 10/10 good priced and great game. great fuc king deal
3949	1	a	dis game is good, had a rocky start with dino beatdown, but the developer has stuck with it and made it an actually good game, i had alot of fun playing this and its dirt cheap now, so there really is no excuse not to have this in your library!
6160	1	a	7/10 i'm no FPS player, but the coop vs dinosaur is pretty cool! Give it a try :P
2374	0	a	its like a worse version of primal carnage. the sound and movement aren't really sinced at least when u shoot.
5123	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS CO-OP OMG! CATCH A GAMERA OMG LOVE THIS GAME ^~^ ^3^ ;-; ===================================================================
469	1	a	OH MY GOD. I didn't think that I was gonna enjoy this game as I'm enjoying it! I've seen a trailer once, and I thought it was an okay game. Now, I think this game is AMAZING! There are some cons to, but I think it's worth it! Any chance for a second one?
4684	1	a	i played this game before when it was free for 7 days (twice) and now im waiting for a friend to buy it
2493	1	a	its one of the best games, some may gripe about the price drop, but its so fun to run around lopping off raptors heads in a single sword swing  really lazy, didnt read: its better than most games that take many many years and many MANY millions of dollars to make
5916	1	a	This game is a beacon of peace and love. Here you see carnivores and herbivores working together, to kill you. Creatures that are natural enemies put their diferences aside to achieve a common goal, and it's beautiful.
579	1	a	Great gameplay, a lot of humour and very interesting concept of a game.
139	1	a	Really fun take on tower defense. good design. AAA art quality.
5001	1	a	bought it at full price GIVE ME SPECIAL STUFF
2194	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is solid. Orion Dino Horde has a Halo/Jurassic Park/Avatar feel to it and I like it! You've got guns, tanks, and planes to kill the dino's. It is mostly PvE but it does have PvP as well. Great pick ESPECIALLY for $1. Get it!!!
4776	0	a	As decent as this game is, it continues to randomly decide that I don't own it, and tells me to re-purchase it. It is in no way worth it's full price, but if you can snatch it for a buck, then you'd might as well.
1903	0	a	Makes no sense for me.You are a robot and you collecting nuggets? wat? Also the game is not funny for me.
6220	1	a	I was honestly ready to jump the bandwagon and give this game as much crap as it seems to get regularly but honestly, now that I've given it a play, it's not that bad. There are a lot of games worse than Prelude out there, and for more money. I went in with my buddy and had fun for a few hours in the different gamemodes. The voice acting is decent, the visuals and atmosphere are actually really good for a few years ago.   I only really trash the animation sometimes, and encountered one bug in this playthrough (scooped up by a flying dino, dropped between a rock face and the invisible playfield border.)  8/10 for what it is, I had a great time. Would definitely replay.
1784	1	a	The good:  -Art; -Space traveling being 'the levels lobby' for missions; -Gameplay is polished for this platformer; -60Hz; -Trading cards;  The bad:  -Menu Options; -User Interface; -Repetivity.  Score: 6/10.
4226	1	a	Spent $1 and a few minutes convincing 2 people to also spend $1. Got the three of us in a hummer and drove it into a Stegosaurus.  We exploded and died.  10/10
3257	1	a	love it all the wasy but sometimes a little lame when you bye your self fun with other
1192	1	a	Serious fun! Fantasy genre meets Plants vs. Zombies. Lay traps to destroy orcs! Fight orcs! Smash! I can't believe I got this game on sale for so cheap! Fast paced good times!
1554	1	a	It's a great game where you're an alien running around a government facility killing scientists and trying to escape. Very brutal and very fun.
3444	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!
1553	1	a	yeah its from EA but its a very polished game well executed but bad ported to pc, u will need a game pad and the game needs some steam achiv..its charming and disturbing, its a good indie game. u should give it a try :)
5124	1	a	Because this is our heritage... if it wasn't for our forefathers, the dedicated shock troopers they were, Dinosaurs would have taken over the universe...   This is a piece of history and I demand it be recognized! -MURICA!
4651	1	a	Wow... got this for a dollar, sooooo worth it. Funnest dinosaur game ever, and you can play as them, well how bout that ;)
4488	1	a	This game has gotten some bad reviews but I actually enjoy this game. While the lack of documentation or tutorials was a poor choice, the combat mechanics are similar to Borderlands 2 or Payday and my friends and I (after the initial issues getting to connect together) had quite a bit of fun in it. I feel it's worth the price while on sale if you enjoy quick action games with some replayability (although the same maps over and over will get old after a while). I mainly play it for the co-op and not the competitive styles (but the Rampage mode where one side can play a dinosaur is entertaining).  It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy games like Payday with repeatable missions and a persistent leveling system for unlocks it's quite an entertaining little diversion.
6460	1	a	&gt;be pleb me &gt;playing Orion: DH &gt;this game sucks but i love it so &gt;stop playing, wait months l8r &gt;see news about prelude &gt;huh.jpg &gt;jump in-game &gt;curb-stomped a baby dino with my knife &gt;thefeelsareback.mpeg &gt;Score: Tangofoxtrot/OrphanTears+3 pears &gt;would play again
1694	0	a	The default resolution doesnt fit in my screen and there is no option to change it.
5391	1	a	it was ok but i hope it can get some more updates an stuff
2798	1	a	Although I can barely handle this game on Low graphics, this game still looks good. The gameplay itself on the other hand, is AMAZING! I can see why they recommend a 6-core processor though xD
6013	1	a	+This game got dinosaurs like you won't believe  +â¥â¥â¥â¥ tha dinos in a mech suit  +â¥â¥â¥â¥ tha dinos in a tank +â¥â¥â¥â¥ tha dinos with a knife -deinosuchus will â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur â¥â¥â¥ up  +deinosuchus will â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur â¥â¥â¥ up
2134	1	a	Ok so this is the best co-op game ever made. (Yes, even better than Killing Floor.)  Why? It has what everyone wants in a FPS co-op; that being boiled down to one word 'FUN'.  This game is pure awesome entertainment. With an easy learning curve and lots of different playing modes. Your co-op team never rage, bully or quit. Everyone is having too much 'fun' for bad feelings to arise.  There is so much you can do, there are three soldier proffesions or in the game 'Rampage' you can be a dinosaur and eat other players! Then there is duel matches, king of the hill and much much more.  There are also a good array of vehicles to run over or shoot dinosaurs with, as well as many weapons and heaps of augmentations and upgrades.  I am completely addicted to this game. :)
6299	1	a	worth a good laugh for 99 cents
2113	1	a	I have to say...when i first saw the reviews for this game a year ago, I avoided it deliberately. However, the developers didn't just sit on their asses while they got bad reviews. 'Games don't fail, only developers do' (love that quote because it's so true). They did something about it, and now I find myself buying this game for my friends who aren't fortunate enough to experience this wonderful FPS. This game mixes dinosaurs, Team Fortress 2, and Halo. The skins are cool, the taunts are hilarious, the gameplay is a dimond in the rough, and it's only a dollar! So if you ever find yourself with a dollar after buying an expensive game, I would strongly recommend getting this game, because it may be better than the one you just purchased.
1049	1	a	Fantastic game. It's like playing a tower defense in first person. Challenging enough but not so difficult you can't master it and 5 skull every level even on Nightmare mode.
1215	1	a	no one get this game
4631	0	a	Don't be fooled by the trailers. This game is surrounded in controversy, mainly due to it's main developer David Prassel. Among a long list of nefarious acts, Prassel has been accused of stealing elements from other games, laying off employees without paying them for work, and manipulating message boards to deflect negative criticism towards the game. In addition Prassel tried to rebrand the game formerly known as 'Dino Beatdown' into 'Dino Horde' to increase Metacritic scores; claiming it to be a sequel when it's more of a content update. Even if one were to ignore the game's depraved upbringing, the game with it's comically short T-Rex arms fails to grasp the lofty claims and over-hype created presumably by Prassel.  Ignoring the game's heavy influence from Halo, the gameplay revolves around a stereotypical group of 'space marines' defending bases against swarms of prehistoric predators, which in of itself sounds okay on paper. However, within the first hour of playing, any seasoned gamer with a critical bone in their body will start to see the game's inherent flaws emerge. The game which marketed itself around commiting mass dino-cide features a surprisingly laughable AI that would make a Stegosaurus roll in it's sedimentary grave. The dinos tend to path in a completely linear fashion towards the player which makes 'Dino Horde' feel more like 'Dino Queue' which really brings the atmosphere in the game to extinction. Taking high ground will often result in dinosaurs running around in erradic beelines as you frantically spray at them with shoddy hit registration until they die. Don't worry about the hit registration though, because all of the basic ground dinosaurs can be run down inside of invincible ground vehicles such as the Wartho- I mean 'Gladiator' combat buggy, making firearms completely pointless outside of killing large dinosaurs. No seriously, I ground dinos into lizard burger for an hour and was awarded top score for being the most unskilled player on my team before I logged off in bitter apathy.  I tried giving this game a fair chance, I really did. I tried looking past Prassel coddling his 'baby' like an overprotective parent, his apparently questionable business practice and his deplorable attempt at dodging Metacritic rating, Underneath it all though was only the husk of a game, a grand idea with poor execution, and unfortunately it will not keep the interest of experienced gamers. Don't get me wrong, this game can be a fun waste of time with friends, but you should be laughing WITH the game, not AT it. Until someone can nail the 'dino defense' game on the head, my dream will remain fossilized in amber until it's DNA can be extracted and brought back to life, which sadly will most likely not be anytime soon.
343	1	a	Killing orcs have never been this fun!  P.S. Also you can kill kobolds, gnols, ogres and other nasties.
1108	1	a	A nice tower defence game that makes you scream ORCS MUST DIE!!!!
1856	1	a	Very fun game. Although I haven't finished it yet I think it's very entertaining.
4621	1	a	It's pretty good, but gatling gun is way too op. Just get it and you've already won.
4059	1	a	i ate chilli last night so i can take a â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is better than this game 
588	1	a	I got a recommendation for this game, I RECOMMEND that you just forget it exists because it's the worst pile of doo doo butter that has ever stained itself upon the steam library. Every time I think of this game I want to vomit until I die. Final Score: 8/10
3283	1	a	Fun, tough, and addicting. Going into the survival mode solo is plain suicide, but it's very fun just to see how far you can make it. The plethora of Steam Achievements is wonderful, and if you are big on trying to 100% games, then you will have your hands full with this, in a good way. At the end of the day, gaming should be a fun, enjoyable time, and that is exactly what this promises and delivers. Walrus Approved.
302	1	a	Hands up who wants to die!
1524	1	a	who would turn down the opportunity to play as an overly agressive sentient teleporting jelly that can warp inside people? exactly. 10/10 would warp agen
4095	1	a	The T-rexs throw rocks better than a MLB super star pitcher.
3833	1	a	thx for my GPU, playing dis game under 30 fps on low-med settings #LoveGrammarNazi
2193	1	a	Yes, this is the game you should buy. Very good for the price.
921	1	a	This game is quite unique perhaps on the PC because whilst it is a tower defence game, this is a tower defence game built on pure action. It is a fast, fluid third person game with a high frame rate and a frenetic pace that never lets up. The controls are responsive and easy to get used to, and the gameplay is as tactically deep as it is fast and furious. Add to that just a lot of great humour that is expressed in the hero's opening lines to each level and this is definitely one of the best indie action games of recent years.
4601	1	a	I love this game, mostly because it's simply dinosaurs and futuristic guns/stuff. Also, I recommend the prelude to ITSELF, Guardians of Orion. 10/10.
4580	1	a	I love this game sooooooo much I quit playing CS:GO for this game.
4490	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥, but when they decided to make it look better, they just made the game more â¥â¥â¥â¥, so now its â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered in â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10 its â¥â¥â¥â¥ `ign
157	1	a	A nice little take on the tower defense and the third person shooter genres. The only draw back outside of the weapon DLC being a bit overpriced for what it gives you is that the main charecters limited repitor of speech files can get a bit grating after a few levels. But if you like tower defense games or even Dungeon Defenders but wished it's single player was better you will like this game.
267	1	a	Guys this game so funny ) try it )
1995	1	a	I got a coupon for this game, cost me 50 cents. I still cant believe how entertaining this game is, serioulsy! Graphically, it's kinda ugly, like a flash game, but the gameplay is fun, and the controls are really solid! Fun for killing time, definitely.
5741	0	a	The best part of the game was when I uninstalled it. 10/10
1164	1	a	This is my new personal favorite amongst all 3rd-person tower defense games!!! Great fun, but unfortunately only singleplayer.
5064	1	a	Surpringly fun. The menu is absolute balls and horrible, but the actual gameplay is fun. Be warned the game is very sensitive to ping. Anything over 100 starts getting a little annoying.
4591	1	a	Friend bought this game as a joke. We played it for 3 hours straight. 10/10 we're getting more friends involved.
5173	0	a	Worst game ive played in a while what a waste of my life.
1865	1	a	A very well made and polished indie game, I really like the variety of the levels and how you want to complete it all, great buy, and if it goes on sale for like 12 cents again get it instead of that CS:GO skin.
2634	1	a	Well it's not the best game out there but it really fun to play + it's very cheap bth 0,79 euros is not that much. I think its worth buying it ! :)
4635	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is so addicting. I absolutely love it. I immediately bought 2 extra copies to giveaway so my friends could enjoy it with me.
2062	1	a	not bad game, you must play it ! :)  nice graphics with great control. 
4404	0	a	It was really cool until i played it
5665	0	a	Free games are better than this, and that's saying something.
4746	0	a	Worst game ever, but is still alright 
4794	1	a	defenitley worth ninety nine cents. I'd probably still get it for two dollars.
5788	1	a	Actually enjoyable and the for the price you get alot.
3082	1	a	A well spent Â£0.79 i must say, very good, recommend to everyone who like dino's or shooting so yeah
3044	1	a	Worth the money! You can kill dinosaurs while flying with a jetpack and looking at the great rain effects!  10/10
2715	1	a	I love the open - world aspect, and the Metascore is totally off, it's a great game, and I reccomend it highly! 
4190	0	a	 Worst Game Ever!  [static2.wikia.nocookie.net]  
698	1	a	What tower defence looks like in the future, but now...
2421	0	a	I dont know one person who auctually likes this game, most my friends play it and they say its only ok
4844	1	a	:)
5890	1	a	I find this game for the price and for gameplay actually amusing and worth the buck. It's silly but fun at the same time and does bring a few good laughs when playing with friends. You're not meant to take this seriously and that is what makes it even better, graphics are not an issue and slaying millions of dinosaurs by punching them in the face or just blowing their brains out or piercing them with arrows is pretty damn entertaining. I'd say buy it fot you can't really go wrong with a buck you probably gained from selling steam cards anyways and if you just want something to pass the time and/or to relieve stress by killing prehistoric beasts then go right ahead.
4936	1	a	Fun and Hard meat Boy stile but chaotic wih friends
1659	0	a	'What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?' is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.  Honestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an 'infinite, recursive, tactical shooter'. By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.  The artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews. I hope.
1112	1	a	Good game, would recommend!
2329	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   ITS LIKE HALO. SURVIVE AND THRIVE. And watch to Dactlys.They seem to be annoying trying to swoop down on u but get a couple of buds and u can survive them.Totally worth to buy it.
2094	0	a	what is this the fourth time this game's been 'released' to wipe off all the negetive reviews? if stolen art assests and the fact your money is going to a scum bag don't bother you, give it a try the games alright for $1  some history if you're intrested.   http://www.gatheryourparty.com/2012/05/04/orion-employee-beatdown/   theres plenty more if you google a bit, these guys have a track record   
2561	1	a	This game is awesome. the .99 cents you pay is worth it, because you get a fast paced gun game with Dinosaurs. If you want to fork out more cash you can buy special custom looks for your character. Great maps and the graphic style is like that of borderlands. This game is a 8 out of 10 for me.
637	1	a	This is a great example of how to combine action and tower defense gameplay.  Gameplay is very fun; the variety of weapons and traps gives you plenty of ways to complete most levels. However, some traps/weapons need to be upgraded before they're useful IMO.  The art style, soundtrack and story (what little story there is) are all fun and upbeat, and make a very fun atmosphere. The little amount of dialogue is gold, too.  Nightmare mode is exactly what is says on the tin.  Absolutely recommended.
1674	1	a	The reviews come close to showing what this game is about, but it can't show you just how good it is because what you'll see will be different than what anyone else sees. The strategies that you will come up with will be different. It's because your arenas will be different, your power up options will be different, and your enemies will be different. This is a different kind of game.  There are only two things about this game that some people may not like. The graphics are blocky and there is no goal other than the level you reach.  If you love a challenge, and enjoy slick game design, you should play this.
2332	1	a	When I bought this game i got to blaze it everyday with a T-rex. T-REX IS LOVE! T-REX IS LIFE! 10/10
6096	1	a	I keep getting picked up by flying dinosaurs and then dropped 1 mile down. 10/10 would be swept up by a Rhamphorynchus again.
1797	1	a	big profit for me, this game for 19 cents and 30-40 cents for cards, so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good
4742	0	a	Sure the game is less that a $1. But it's real bad. About an hour of gameplay before you'll get bored of it. I guess you get what you pay for.
5256	0	a	this game wasnt worth the cents paid for it. pretty much on par with bad rats, but bad rats is a bad joke.  Orion is just bad.
494	1	a	A cross between a third-person shooter/Tower Defense game, it also features amusing dialogue and a lot of room for creativity. This game is a ludicrous amount of fun. Buy it, right now. No, seriously, buy it right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing now.
3086	1	a	Funny game :) got alot of fun playing all those game mods, shooter based on the unreal engine. With 3 classes, each got his unique skills, different dinosaurs, variating from small Comps -&gt; Raptors -&gt; Triceratops -&gt; T-Rex's etc etc. even Spinosaurus and the Deinosuchus Croc. U can play all these dinosaurs and even flying Pteranodons etc.   Nice survival mods, egg caputure etc etc. alot of different weapons add even more fun and tons of achievements. Get this game its worth it :) sometimes its even supercheap like i got 4x for just 3â¬ or so :)
5156	0	a	Don't bother. Much better titles have been done on the same premise.
2747	1	a	360 no scopped T-Rekt while i eat Doritos n MtnDew  9/11  MinamiNyan
4079	1	a	Got given as a gift but would pay full price for game- really suprised me.
3025	1	a	this game is the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ I`ve never played for 0.79â¬ and will give u tons of hours of entertaiment
5979	1	a	It's a fun game to play during some down time inbetween activities.
3026	1	a	So addictive, and for the price you can't beat it!
3317	1	a	It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs
566	1	a	Orcs must Die! is a third person action Tower defense game and probably the best when its about the gameplay. You play as a War Mage who needs to defend Gates from ugly Orcs. To do this task you can use Traps and Weapons as well as some envoirmental stuff.   The Gameplay is pretty straight forward. The first Wave and every 5 Waves you have unlimited Time to decide what to Build. Between each other wave you have a time limit until the next wave starts. You can purchase Traps with money. You get money for killing Orcs and you get even more money if you kill Orcs with more than one Trap. The trick is to get as many traps on one place as possible. You need of course something to fight for yourself. For that you can use a magical crossbow that can shoot bolts very fast or a Sword. You can also use magical items to shoot fire or ice and with the DLC you get some interesting items like a pot full of acid which you can throw on the orcs to kill loads of orcs with one attack. All items have a secondary attack that uses mana (In case of the Acid pot it always costs mana to balance it). You can refill your mana at the Gate that you need to defend. Or you can use a magical contraption that refills your mana if you stand next to it. Later in the game you get the wavers, which sell upgrades if you have a spare coin for them.   The grafics are nothing special but the artstyle is great. I always considered that the artstyle is more important than the grafics of a game and Orcs Must Die! is the best example for that. The medival comic look fits nicely with the theme of the game.  The Soundtrack is pretty good. It is mostly medival rock music and fits perfect to the artstyle and the Gameplay.    If you like or dont like this review than please tell me why. If there are grammar problems in the text please let me know.

1204	1	a	Nice change up from the Tower Defense genre with the added fun of an FPS! I've spent plenty of hours on this already.
4664	1	a	Brought me a pizza.  10/10
708	1	a	If you like third-person shooters with a mix of tower defense, then 'Orcs Must Die!' is something you'll probably enjoy. Play as the former wizard's apprentice, the War Mage, as you strive to protect magical rifts to the protagonist's homeworld. Those gateways set in various fortresses, you build a variety of traps or even fight head-on with various weapons/abilities to keep hordes of orcs and other monsters from reaching their goal. The game is so fun that will have you hecticly thinking on your virtual feet to plan the many ways to dispatch the onslaught. Replay levels several times after you manage to unlock all the traps, weapons and upgrades to see if you can make it to the top of the leaderboards amongst your friends or the rest of the world. Seriously, you'll have lots of fun.
110	1	a	Good game and fun to play some poker-like-game. Had fun playing it, but wouldn't pay full price, wait till it's on sale :)
28	0	a	Promising start, with really polished UI and tutorial, but game crashes upon leaving the first village, and there's no known solution nor support available. Until I figure it out, or find a computer on which it doesn't crash, I cannot give a better review. But watch out for this if you want to buy the game.
572	1	a	Picked this up at 75% off for the steam achievement for the holidays, but quickly ended up spending an hour in it. And then another... and another. The game is just really clean and does what it sets out to do really well. This puts a ton of creativity back into the bland 'tower defense' style genre and plays to different strengths. If you're confident with a crossbow or a sword, you can dump money and items into improving that. If your trap strategy is top notch, dump all your money into a maze of tricks and traps designed to do only one thing; Kill. All. The Orcs.  Would have paid full price if I knew what I was getting into. It's got great gameplay, a smooth engine, just the right dash of humor and a lot of things to kill in a bunch of different ways. And if you ever find yourself with nothing to do, scratch your chin at the leaderboards and fine tune your strategy to not only survive the orcs - but kill them efficiently and brutally.
2667	1	a	I played this game when it was free for a day and I was very negative and only looked at the bad parts of the game.  But when my friend and I wanted to play some co-op we decided to give this a second try. And It's actually really fun! Maybe the idea and sounds are kind of cheesy but the game is packed with hours of fun.  I recomend this game for the people who want's a good cheap co-op game. 10/10 would dinosaur again.
4229	0	a	Blood Vomit. All over. Rotten Apple out of 10
5414	1	a	STAY AWAY FROM ME DINO!!!! &gt;:V ILL KILL YOU!!!! 10/10 would run from the dinos again!!!!
2761	1	a	fantastic value, good gameplay and all forÂ£0.99??? AMAZING!!1
3304	1	a	To be honest, i only played the free trial, (3-5 days) but i have to say, i am quite surprised how AWESOME this game was ;)
704	1	a	I used to like orcs...
4602	1	a	I honestly thought this game looked awful at first. Then i played it! Its a freaking fantastic little game, its fun, its different and it has dinosours! what more could one ask for?! The meta critic reviewers are just pompus ignorant $#*!'s who rate CoD:ghosts 73 for christ sake! Ignore the professional reviews and look to the actual gamer reviews that are mostly positive. The game is best played with a group of friends as playing with randoms can get a little iritating but over all its a good game. For its price, its un-beatable!
5418	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
327	1	a	awsome fun filled game made me forget my girlfriend a must buy if you want to divert your mind into funcoholic!!
5085	1	a	there is no blood on the ground, only at walls 
3609	0	a	How the heck did you mess up a game about Dinosaurs and Jet Packs?! Between the horrid control scheme, barren environments, and things don't even make sense, this game is horrid. Not worth a dollar.
659	1	a	good 3rd person tower defence
5056	1	a	Very good game.
5986	1	a	This game is like a halo style shooter with a nazi zombie feel as you have waves of dino's both land and air attacking you. cool and very fun to play with friends, i also like the addition of the tanks, at-at things and the jeeps they make getting around the huge map a lot easier ( as its dino sized and you are tiny ) 7/10
2485	0	a	This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?  The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is 'downed'. The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little 'increments' when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.  Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?  It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was 'Dino Beatdown' or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.  Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.
3122	1	a	You should to beat T-Rax its A freaking Hard and that's makes game Realistic   Don't forget you can use Joystick or Dualshock Controller its wroth it bro   And its best game you can play when you get boredddddddddd Enjoy!!!  
2240	0	a	So I see a ton of reviews stating that 'This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!', but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.  Pros: The game is 0.99c. It has co-op in so many ways. It has pvpve. it has hordes of dinos. It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank. There are lots of weapons. Conquest mode has a very interesting concept. It has the old announcer styled 'Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect'.  Cons: There is a bug that allows your 'Private' server to become a public server without warning. There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears. For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use. If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much. Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.) Getting stuck on spots is very likely. The tank's machine gun is ear â¥â¥â¥â¥ much like the large dino roars. The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will. There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds. They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now. The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos. There are still other bugs that have not been adressed. Controllers still do not function properly with the game. The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems. This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.  So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that. So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.
5316	1	a	1) Load Jurrasic Park theme 2) Play with a bunch of friends 3) ??? 4) Profit  10/10 would medic gun a T-Rex â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
1964	1	a	Very fun is all i can say :P
5436	0	a	Do like Dinosaurs, Jet Packs, Mechs, Tanks, and all sorts of other cool accessories? You do? Well guess what? Orion has all of that! But Is it any fun? No, It's not fun at all. The idea of blasting down Dinosaurs with you're pals is a great idea, It really is. However, It's prestented poorly with this game.    GAMEPLAY
2217	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
5596	0	a	Just... Just awful.
6198	1	a	This game is one of a kind. I loved the game play and how hard the bosses were(sorry for the bad spelling).
6191	1	a	99cent for killing Dinos? Totaly worth it even if it was 4.99 it would still be worth it
2158	0	a	What a huge piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Very poorly optimized.  Framerate is poor and drops constantly. Specially when the dinos come.  Unplayable, unenjoyeable.
2082	1	a	  TLDR version;

730	1	a	Great game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you coal and coupons.
3893	1	a	I played it a while back on a free weekend and saw it was only Â£1 and i had just over a pound left so i got it and its an awesome game
4073	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
3370	1	a	It may be Glitchy as hell. Contain more bugs then any other games. Issues with just about everything but damn is this fun with a few friends!
236	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce! Bathe in that stuff youngster... it'll keep you sharp and youthful inside long past the point where hope and happiness fades into a bitter diy tincture that doesn't heal the wound that won't close... yes.... a most excellent orc genocide simulator! Bonus creatures included for happy end!! and it had a very good sequel also! :D
1710	1	a	 An awesome platforming game with a robot
1159	1	a	love the game
868	1	a	It's Lord of the Rings meets Sanctum in this brilliant action/tower defense game. From the moment you lay your first trap you will be drawn in by the distinctive characters. As the title implies there is only one objective, you must kill every last orc that charges into your keep. The myriad of traps at your disposal, as well as your keen sword and spells, get this task done with prejudice. It's wickedly entertaing and slightly demented watching the orcs hurl themselves into spinning blades and explosive barrels, all the while taunting you and laughing about their impending victory. I had childish glee when the hero started trash talking back. For a game with only one hero and a handful of enemy types it is dripping with charm and style. However it is not without minor issues. The animations could use a little more work and the single minded gameplay won't last forever, but these are barely worth mentioning. The dark sense of humor and the variety of death mark this as a must play8/10
2795	1	a	A game so bad, it's good.  I bought a four pack of this for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles when it was on sale (90 cents a pop). Sent it to a couple of buds and started playing. There are so many mediocre elements in this game it's mind boggling.   LOOKS: At a glance the game looks kind of good. Until it starts to move. Animations are laughably bad, with characters running in comic fashion, kicking their heals against their butts as they run. Torso's not moving and turning as if on a swivel. Jumping looks equally terrible, with characters bouncing up into the air without bending their legs to push off. Dinosaurs movement is OK-ish if you do not count the bad AI creating what my friends and I ended up calling, 'Dino-trains'. A conga line of dinosaurs in all shapes and size, being kited across the battlefield as if connected to the player by invisible strings.  GUNPLAY: Weapons in this game are completely bland and unrealistic. From sounds to looks to feel. None of them stand out. Cross-hairs are obtrusive making aiming down site an awful experience. All gun sounds scream stock wav file.  BUGS: So many bugs, weird AI mess-ups, bad design choices (like having to run back and forth between a generator and the weapons caches in horde mode), clipping issues, getting stuck, spawning under the terrain. The list goes on and on.   GAMEMODES: PVP is a joke, with dinosaurs controlling like drunk trucks being driven by blind drivers. Horrible hit detection on their attacks and impossible camera angles making it even worse. There are so many invisible walls and clipping bugs in this game I started to wonder if the devs ever played their own product. Until I killed a dev and got an achievement (which was kind of cool).  This game has one redeemable game-mode, which is Survival (horde mode). This mode is the game's single saving grace. I wasn't expecting anything when I went in, but playing this with a couple of friends is a total blast. The constant upgrades in weaponry and vehicles between waves of enemies and their ever increasing size is just fun. Plain and simple fun.  Would I recommend this? The crazy thing is, yes, yes I would. But only if you can get it for a buck like I did. Spending more on this is just not worth it. Unless you're really into bad B-games and dinosaurs. It is good for a lot of laughs because of the over-the-top badness (is this even a word?), bugs and crazy physics. Survival mode is genuinely fun though. So at least there's that.
3129	1	a	This game + the Jurassic park movies prove that all dinosaurs are evil, even the good ones. Cheaper then a chocolate bar. Random crashes just add to the fun.  10/10 would throw grenades at dinosaurs again 
3428	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
4336	1	a	This game has improved a lot since it first came out. It is a very fun game now, especially when you play with friends. A fun game+giant boss dinos that tower above you = Recommend.
6138	1	a	There is no reason why you should not own this game. It's $0.99! Buy the 4 pack and gift it to your friends!
5407	0	a	Even though it was only 99 cents i still asked for a refund
4354	1	a	the only thing i dont like is that i dont know how to get the mechs 
5018	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2272	1	a	I've put in a lot of hours into this game and it's better than last two COD games released! I'm looking at you COD Ghosts!!! Anyways, the game is highly adictive and fun and may have some issues if you're playing solo or online! Unless you got a really good gaming computer like Alien or similar, than disable blooming and dynamic lighting! (even though it takes away from the overall awesomeness it brings to the game) And set the game to windowed mode to help out with makeing sure you have a better speed! (May not work for everybody) Overall this game will bring back nostalgia of Turok while adding other styles of games to make a familiar, yet unique, style of gameplay! Hope you guys (and gals) have as much fun as I have with this game!
4957	1	a	After seeing the price and the screen shots and game videos I knew I had to get it. Gameplay is great. Although I do wish their were more waves with bigger/more bad â¥â¥â¥ dinos. My only critic of the game is that it is extremely hardware intensive. Most games i play make my computer temperature around 40 at most but this game made my GPU almost at 56 at some moments.
3948	1	a	BEST GAME EVER GET IT
3935	1	a	play this!
5497	0	a	3/10 is just boring
4010	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played.
3897	1	a	Technically terrible. Could get you some fun if you can get over that.
3896	1	a	nerubian dino hord is a revolushonary game that blends the horde mode made by halo reach and jurassic park to make an incredibul gamig experiense
4686	1	a	Played this game before seeing the metacritic review and was surprised to see how low of a score it got. It's actually been a lot more fun than i thought it would be, I've found myself putting hours into it so far and for the price it's worth it. Maybe because I grew up playing turok and loving dinos ( especially Killin um) that makes this game so much fun!
4975	1	a	it didn't give me cancer. 5 stars.
2930	1	a	54 cents Hour Download Instant Regret. 11/10 Not Halo
5232	1	a	Worth the 0.99$ :)
2775	1	a	Great game!
2426	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that had such a low price that I had no idea if it was actually going to be a quality product. Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.  ORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.  The game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.  The sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things.   In total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time. Somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10.
5099	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
5249	1	a	Why is this game rated 36/100??? its like frigging halo meets jurassic park, with upgrades, special abilities, and giant â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs trying to eat you and your base! SWEET GAME! Multiplayer is the â¥â¥â¥â¥!
1520	0	a	I Demoed this on console and it was was fun, but this pc version a terrible port. Origin account making and constantly logging in is terrible, game constantly crashed, never got to play this download.
5341	0	a	I seriously think the people who like this game have never played another coop shooter or something because the 'coop' is the only thing that could ever be considered fun about this garbage and no I don't think it's fun... Sure, I'd like to shoot dinos but this game is a joke.  Dislike: 1. Crap framerate yet the dinos are fast as balls half the time so theres nothing fun about shooting a speeding incomplete animation.   2. Buggy... don't get stuck  3. Guns aren't even fun to shoot. The pistal doesn't even have a shooting animation it just stiffly sits there making gun sounds.   4. I get that it's a buck and that's 'soooo cheap' but I feel like I wasted my money. If I buy games like Killing Floor on Steam for 2 bucks that are immediately great games then a buck for this broken, ugly, laggy, crap is way too much.   5. It seriously just sucks  Likes:  1. Jet pack was actually fun.    If shooting dinos with friends sounds fun to you it also did to me and I think this game is crap. If you want a truely good coop FPS with giant things to kill get the Serious Sam games. This game doesn't deserve your money.     
3319	1	a	Fun Game watch out for those t-rex's!
3107	1	a	Good game for such a cheap price.
242	1	a	Veridict: 9.0  The protagonist will make you laugh your *ss off, while the tower defense style of this game will turn you into a fan of the genre. And if you are already a 'tower defense guy', then this title is a must have.  Despite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.  Orcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.  Fun is the only word capable of defining this game. And if you ended it and liked it, don't get emotional.. there's a sequel for this: Orcs Must Die! 2, so you can keep playing and slaying more and more orcs.
4014	1	a	A very awesome game i Love the whole Dino feel and hunting them down i rate this game 7/10
638	1	a	A good game.I like it so much...i want to buy the Orcs must die 2.
3384	1	a	Sold a duplicate Portal 2 trading card to get the money for this game. Went in, played, and was eaten by a t-rex.  11/10
168	1	a	Super awesome game where you do tower defense while attacking stuff. You get to kill hoards of orcs!
6162	1	a	Great game and very fun to play with friends and for 99cents cant beat it!
5427	0	a	The graphics are nice (thanks to Unreal Engine) and it's fun for a while, but the game is very buggy, the maps are too big, you have to travel way too far to buy upgrades and weapons, and it get's very repetitive pretty quickly. The only way I'd actually recommend it is if it's cheap, especially since it has lots of in-app purchases and seems like it should be a free to play game. I don't regret buying it since I got it cheap but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're really into dinosaurs.
1955	1	a	Wall-E + Mario + Scrap Mechanic = BEEP Yoshi + Jets + Robots = BEEP Spaggetih + MeatBalls + Drink = Yum
5785	1	a	Great online fps game, highly recommend, fun as hell played it all night!
4961	0	a	Selling tf2 key for a hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3730	0	a	this game is horendus â¥â¥â¥â¥. do not EVER buy it. everything is done wrong, its laggy, clitchy and even that the idea sounds cool, it is done very poorly.
4325	0	a	Terrible... Just terrible. The least they could do is make the in-game purchases menu look a bit better right?
6408	1	a	My friends and I jokingly installed this game and laughed at it for a good three hours. It's a lot of fun and definitely worth a purchase if you've taken advantage of trying it out for free. Servers can get pretty choppy at times. In my experience at least, the game does run a bit more smoothly after a little while.   
6385	1	a	Played it for the free week or so they offered. Costs a buck, and its 25 off so its 75c at the moment. Just played an hour easy and had heaps of fun. Bought it as I closed it to have a break, no regret, no problem. Reminds me of Halo, a Survival Defense on most levels, great PVE fun. Vehicles and stuff are sweat, love the slomo team mate deaths and the general attitude. Needs more Aussie servers but hey EVERYONE can afford it for a buck and populate those servers :P  I understand they got a bad rep in the past when they released it but ive found no problems now with this and would recommend this over any of the cods that have come out lately. Same content but more fun!  7/10 9/10 for the value and effort put in by the devs WELL DONE!
398	0	a	While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.
4123	1	a	Rather than review the game, I'd like to point out a few things about it.  1. What's new and groundbreaking? Nothing. What's fun? Everything. What's a ripoff? MAYBE some of the aesthetic items from the in-game store, but they don't change the game at all.  2. Remember the days of Blockbuster? Pay five dollars and you can try a game for one week. If you don't like it, you're out five dollars and you have to give it back anyway. Well for 20% of that ($1) you can try this game, and believe me when I say it's worth trying. If you don't want to spend that dollar, just sell some of the trading cards you picked up from other games.  3. If you get only four hours of fun out of this game, it's a victory. That's $.25 per hour of fun. To get that same value from a AAA title you need to have 240 hours of fun. Be honest, did you play CoD: Ghosts for 240 hours and enjoy it the whole time?
769	1	a	cool game, better then i expected, can't remember if i got it for 10$ with the 2 dlc's or what. Game reminds me of torchlight, the colors, architecture &amp; music is ALL very pleasant &amp; i would reccomend this game + dlc for 10$ without much question. I have played it for like 4 hrs so i don't know how much better it will get but i do NOT regret getting it though i never really wanted to begin with. Can't give a out of 10 since i haven't completed at least 50%. Fun game it is.
2743	1	a	It's nice to get your head bitten off by a T-Rex!
1496	1	a	There's the good news and the bad news.  The good news is- this is one of the best games I've tried this year!  You're playing this cute little alien guy who teleports around and brutally murders people by blowing them up from the inside. If you've played Unreal Tournament, that's also known as 'telefragging'- actually, this game could easily be named something like 'Telefrag-the Game' :P Now, that's kind of justified because the humans captured the little alien and were performing horrible experiments on it, and are trying to shoot it on sight without any attempt of communication, so... yeah :) The gameplay is strangely addictive and the puzzles (because of course there are puzzles) are reminiscent of Oddworld games, where one wrong step spells doom for the alien guy. Based just on those facts, I could HIGHLY recommend grabbing this game.  Now... the bad news. This game WANTS you to have an Origin account. Yeah, that's EA Games for you. It asks for EA login, then it asks for the serial key, then, after activating and starting the game, it asks for the SAME serial key, only this time you can't paste the damned thing and need to type it in manually. After that, you need to log in to the Origin account, AGAIN, from the game...   WHY? Why doesn't it just let me play the game when I try to start it? Why does EA HAVE to meddle with pointles layers upon layers of DRM?   I guess at least the only 'good' thing you have from all this is, the game actually registers on your Origin account as well, so yeah.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're prepared to endure a bit of pointless logging in and typing a 16-character serial number manually like in the olden ages (or registering an Origin account if you don't have one), this game is AWESOME. Go get it!
5134	0	a	This game has a potentially fun concept, but confusing graphics, awkward maps, stuttering dinos, and a host of other issues leave much to be desired. Perhaps future updates will change this review, but as of now, I can think of way better ways to spend time shooting stuff.
2834	1	a	great game 
1177	1	a	You can kill Orcs, IGN 9/10
5361	1	a	great game, recommend
205	1	a	Fun game love all the trap, wepaons and spells variations. Great game in my eyes worth the buy.
373	0	a	It's like Dugeon Defenders, But not fun
4231	1	a	Really fun, old game. But ffs 251 Achievements. 11/10.
6215	1	a	$1 game is worth it since I like killing dinosaurs... but I'm not paying real $$$ to upgrade my character... -_-
2065	1	a	Not bad at all. There's nothing else here but good physics based platforming, but for the price, BEEP is a quite a charmer.
1102	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive!
3785	1	a	Very fun game.  Also, â¥â¥â¥â¥ Activision.
4142	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
5288	1	a	Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-SymonÃ© guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.
6392	1	a	Great game but could you please fix the lag?
153	1	a	Must have !
1693	1	a	I gotta say, so far I'm loving this game! I liked it enough that I bought a copy and sent it to the dudes at Steam Train. I hope they have as much fun playing it as I did :D
5578	1	a	Who cares about:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Epic game for 0,99c pls more and firetruck negative reviews just because of this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
3715	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
145	1	a	This is an awesome game, lots of action, and humor. The best part is you can play this on the crappiest laptops/computers!
3250	1	a	Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!  This is a First person shooter game.    Interface/Menu/Settings
383	0	a	Life is too short, Don't waste it.
2418	1	a	36/100. The score you see upon entering this page, and trust me, this is NOT for this state of the game, from what I can understand,this game got that score when it was released in an early version that had many problems with graphics, gameplay, etc,from which it gained poor reviews,and caused people to hate the game, leaving it with that score. I choose to ignore that score, and buy it in the sale. Thank god I did.  I can say from my experience, this is, THE BEST, multiplayer dino game to play with friends, other games such as Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day are fun, but I haven't had quite as many laughs and fun from those games than this one.  Me and my friend agree that this has the most variety of any dinosaur game out there, (which I will list in the good and bad points of this game).   Now, by no means is this a '10/10 OMG BEST GAME EVARS' game, this game certainly has it's faults, for me it's the store, which involves *gasp* micro-transactions to buy hats and taunts[where does that sound familiar?], but again, buying in-game items is not necessary to win in game,*cough*EA*cough*.  Good Points:  Well optimized -At least for me. This game runs at a great FPS on my PC, and my computer isn't the best in the world by any means, ;-;  Variety - Oh god, where do I start? Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)  CO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.  Sound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.  Updates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to see what they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.  Bad Points:  Single Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a 'Single-player' game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.  Sound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be ready for a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)   Well, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;  1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos. 2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)   Final words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the Â£11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)  Thanks for reading! (Or, going into the comments just to rage about me talking about the rating of this game)
94	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
3522	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'
4904	1	a	this game is great!!!!!!
2974	1	a	Well it had more than i wanted and the graphics are epic
3766	1	a	Fun. Cool too.  I want that song from the third video.
3006	1	a	Ruined my life. 'Just one more wave.' 10/10 would bang.
5936	1	a	The game is a whole dollar! Buy it! But seriously, great cooperative survival/hordes game. If you like killing floor or team fortress, you're going to love this game; especially when you consider the paltry price tag. Think Halo, meets Turok, meets Killing Floor and voila you have Orion Prelude! Highly recommend purchasing it!
5787	0	a	This game should not have the single player tag. Game is not intuitive. I see a lot of weapons sitting there, but there is no key to pick them up. I will investigate the forums if I ever decide to try this game again.  There was a response to a question about playing solo in the forums:  'The short answer is: Yes.  You'll not be able to level up and unlock equipment, you won't get achievements, the game is much more fun to play with other people and more difficult to play alone.'
2785	1	a	Super fun, fast action dino killer.
4531	0	a	bad optimization. I meet minimum specs but still forced to turn town resolution and graphics-everything looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥
3968	1	a	need optimization
4837	0	a	I expected a lot after watching the trailer for this game, but they still havenÂ´t fixed a LOT of bugs, they shouldÂ´ve started development of this game from the bottom. There is missing full controller support and itÂ´s just not as good as I thought it would be.  4,5/10
5121	1	a	This game has awesome co-op! They seriously have improved so much since last time when I played! Go and get it, It has beautiful environments, and has Multiplayer go fight against players and friends  I. Am. Now. A. Huge. Fan. Of. This. Game. You. Should. Be. Too. :)
4878	1	a	Charged into a pack of dinos with no regret, Didnt die 8/8
6355	1	a	good game for only 0.79
2963	1	a	pretty amazing game. i got it for .99 so that makes it even sweeter. good game play great graphics would recomend it to others
502	1	a	Most awesome tower defense game ever. There is a tough difficulty curve, but I've never felt cheated or forced into buying the DLC. In fact, I've beaten all the levels (even on Nightmare) without it. There is tons of replay value with this game due to the sheer number of weapons and traps and maps available.   I love this game from the humor to the artwork to the gameplay.  The only thing I felt it was lacking was co-op, something that the second game brings in.
2656	1	a	Teached me so much about history, 5 stars.
4188	0	a	This game was completely broken at release months later it was just as bad.. hoorible rip off steam should hide thier face in shame for even selling it and not refunding peoples money
5169	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
959	1	a	Dead Orc = Good Orc
5980	0	a	I tried this when it was free to play. It is just an awful game.
3876	1	a	10/10  Best game I've ever played.
692	1	a	great game, a lot of fun
2050	1	a	What am I doing with my life?
211	1	a	Brutal all the way. Must try
1259	1	a	Fantastic Gameplay with great tactical elements, a tower defense masterpiece without the towers, where the sole objective is to use the myrid arsenal of traps and weapons to stop waves of half brained, one liner spouting Orcs.  
631	1	a	The RPG!
2922	1	a	A fun little game which doesn't really feel like it's that much special but it's a great game to play for a few hours with a bunch of pals.
6359	1	a	Great game, great coop, addicting, runs smoothly, = amazing game worth you money
3069	1	a	I'm not sure why there is so much hate surrounding this game. It is not bad, and is deffinatly worth the 99 cents i payed. Flawed, but fun.
2173	1	a	I got teleported into a Triceratops and my vehicle randomly exploded. 10/10 would play again
5296	0	a	This game is actual â¥â¥â¥â¥. but thats just my opinion. as soon as i started it up 1 my game lagged so bag on the title screen. 2 the game was fine in the actual game? idk why. 3 flying raptors? huh 4 dinos walking sideways. basicly flipped on there side walking on a invisible wall. 5 Lag 6 me and my friend where playing and there was a dino walking across the sky box... 7 sliding dinos with no walk animation. It might be worth it to some people but PLEASE do not waste your money.. because i can guarantee you will want a refunt in under a hour..
960	1	a	Starts out slow - boring, even. But the more new abilities, traps, enemies and levels you unlock, the more addictive it gets!
1206	1	a	Very fun game with a good variety of towers to choose from.
3143	1	a	Awesome game on replay value!
6414	1	a	Not a bad game if you like FPS, &amp; co-op PVE.
1812	1	a	Very nice game,
91	1	a	If you are even moderatly good at poker, you can beat this game. Still quite a fun game though!
379	0	a	Didn't do it for me at all. Part of the joy of tower defense is watching your little machine devour enemies. I didn't enjoy running around inside the machine in some kind of mediocre 1st-person shooter. This made the game less fun for me.
607	1	a	I got this on sale for less than the price of a piece of cheese at the local convenience store.  Pros: For a game released in 2011 the graphics are still holding up strong Solid Third Person Shooter/Tower Defense game with a challenge that doesn't feel intimidating. Simple, fun, seemingly arcade style gameplay. Music is basic, appropriate, and not annoying. Better than cheese, and I really like cheese.  Cons: I waited to long to find out that Orcs Must Die! I still want a piece of cheese.
4444	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
4735	1	a	I enjoyed this game for the first bit. It was better when there were more than 2 people online.
898	1	a	I thought this was just a silly little same but for as simple as the idea is i find it really enjoyable.
5765	1	a	Dinosaurs. Lightsabers. Cheap. Fun. What more could you ask for?
2766	1	a	This is the worst game in my library. I love it.
1767	1	a	Fantastic little platforming game. Does a pretty good job of mixing it up and introducing new mechanics at regular intervals: each world has a unique set of properties and hazards. Lovely art, along with an excellent and fitting soundtrack, make this a gem of a game.  Possibly the best dollar you'll ever spend; well worth the asking price.
2611	1	a	Non scoped a T-Rex with a Sniper for 0.49â¬... 11/10 Best game...
4512	1	a	This video sums it all up.  https://youtu.be/zoHFWd1qi0c 
1570	0	a	I find this game to be rather boring. Even on fast forward the waves can take way too long. It just isn't really all that fun.
2975	1	a	It's not a great game, It's not the game with the best animations, or the best gameplay, It's one of those games which is cheap and sells alot because of the great times you have with your friends blasting dinos.
6238	1	a	Got rammed by 2 guys in a jeep with a machine gun into a giant T-Rex. Jeep blew up, they died and I got chomped to death  9/10 - would get rammed into a T-rex again.
316	1	a	I want a present.
24	1	a	Its a card game first, and a fighting game second. Each fight is structured by the cards played. And by 'cards', I mean a 52 card deck.  Your attacks come in the form of stacks of five such cards. Following Yahtzee Croshaw and Poker rules, getting say, a 5-of-a-kind will increase the damage that can be dealt.  The end all goal, of course, is to slay whoever you're fighting. Artwise its beautiful, but the lore of the game is handed to you via text, and wayyyyy too much of it.  8/10

1016	1	a	A bit repetitive but quite funny. I wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect any deep strategy here, just lots of lightweight mayhem :-)
218	1	a	I really like this game. It's a charming 3rd person action tower defense score-chaser that doesn't take itself too seriously.   You set traps and kill things (sometimes even without the traps). There are lots of traps and lots of ways to play. This game uses a fairly simple scoring mechanism of kill steaks and combos (#of things hitting something as it dies) that is easy to understand, but tough to master so topping the leaderboards is quite the trick.  The price is affordable, the game has 24 levels that can be played on any of the 3 (only the last 2 matter) difficulty settings + a few more levels in the Lost Adventures DLC and I find it to be worth every penny.
5097	1	a	Very Good Game,Amazing Multiplayer. 8/10
1987	1	a	This game is pretty cool, the anti grav thing is awesome and fun to use.
847	1	a	This game is amazingly addicting. Fast paced castle defense and shooter mix-up kind of thing. It's a unique blend of awesome.
705	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an extremely fun Tower Defense game, with a very nice mix of tower (trap) defense and third person action game.  While there are clearly some traps which are much more useful than others and you will tend to gravitate towards them, there is still a large amount to choose from, so you can easily set up some deadly combinations to defeat the invading orcs.  The gameplay is where the game really shines, while the level design is so-so, the sheer amount of variety in the game compensates for that.  The only major fault of the game is that it appears personal abilities are very strong and can overshadow the traps themselves, so if you are strategy minded you might be disappointed since, especially in the early waves, you will have to rely heavily on your character to do most of the work.  Great game let down by balance issues and level design.  8 / 10
1858	1	a	Be careful if you buy it for money, your friends will all turn on you and make you regret every wrong thing you did in life and call you an idiot for it.    9/10 would enjoy it if I didn't have friends.
6328	1	a	This game is overall some dirt cheap fun! A fun game to just waste time and mindlessly kill dinos. Well worth the measly 99 cent price.
1057	1	a	Nice tower defense,with funny voice acting :-) 7/10
1848	1	a	Asked Steam for a refund because I didn't really want this game. Accepted my refund. Never gave me my money back. Wanted to try playing it again. Have to buy it again.
3458	1	a	Punched a dinosaur. 30-10
3636	1	a	Amazing Game nothing else to say  just amazing
4299	0	a	6 minutes well wasted.
1113	1	a	very addicting!

667	1	a	A very fun game. It's kind of like Sanctum but with a fantasy setting instead of a science fiction setting. Build traps, unleash the horde and kill waves of orcs with your crossbow/sword and the traps you've build. At first I thought it was a little easy, but obviously the further you progress teh harder the levels become. I recommend this game to everyone that likes towerdefense-shooter hybrids. The only downside is the lack of multiplayer, but that's what Dungeon Defenders is for I guess.
1330	1	a	awseome story.. but KB/mouse controls ruined the gameplay
686	1	a	Cool Indie game :D 7/10 Stars *******
878	1	a	i killed a lot of orcs. it was pretty fun. definitely worth a few dollars. give green to kill green. orc are scum kill all orc.
4603	0	a	like dinosaurs but with jetpacks and guns kinda  not very good
4797	1	a	Were the devs on an acid trip when making this game? 10/10 would have a good time with my best friends again.
2252	1	a	EPIC dino killing!!! Ps. the METACRITIC Score is WRONG!! its for the old version, this is Mk2, all new and improved!!
1142	1	a	Fun but very challenging, or maybe I'm just bad at it.
4217	0	a	its badly designed,not very good looking, not very fun and not even worth 99 cent, and the metacritic score is misleading it should be under 20 percent 1.5/10
5808	1	a	This game is bad. BUT it is also  fun . There are many horribly bad games that you can enjoy, especially with a friend. And this is one of those games. Just grab a friend or two and play without thinking about it and you will find yourself having a good time even though you know that you shouldn't enjoy it.
2448	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
1883	0	a	Played about two minutes of it.  It needs controller support.
2167	1	a	Payed only 25 cent on a sell, 7 hours later, OH MY GOD BEST GAME EVER, I mean who the heck does not like dinos and halo like combat? The fact the developers stuck with this over the years shows dedication. Drives a jeep around in circles as dinos ragdoll under my wheels as I squeel about the lighting effects in the game. 10/10
598	1	a	One of the best games in 2011, I recommend!
3207	1	a	Â£1 for a game thats like cod zombies in the halo universe (obiously with dinosaurs instead of zombies), brillent, shame about the wave limit.  10/10 ragdoll physics - rammed a triceratops witha tank, did a double backflip then exploded

2985	0	a	This game sucks
220	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
2847	1	a	Really fun, especially when played with friends
4510	0	a	its a crappy horrible game. 0/10 wouldnt install for anything.
2142	1	a	For $0.99 you can go buy a chicken sandwich or shoot T-Rexs with a grenade launcher while flying through the air with a jet pack strapped to your back. Its not even a tough call.
303	1	a	A very biased piece that criminally neglects to show the staggering number of grieving mother orcs and countless baby orcs now forced to grow up in a single parent household. White man strikes again...

5887	1	a	Just Like My childhood dreams.....KILLING F****** DINOSAURS
2924	1	a	I have no idea why did it take me so long to adore this game. Maybe it's the weird Metacritic score or some bad reviews from random people. I tried the game during free promo weekends and was all like: 'Meh, I'd better play some Killing Floor'. Now, I make a statement that this game is really fun. TONS of play modes, plenty lots of weapons and enemies. I won't say that this is a co-op game where you shoot dinos and stuff. It's all about how YOU play it. Deathmatch, Survival, Rampage, CTF. Weather changes, heavy rain and night time make you almost blind, your FOV can be frozen if you play in Arctic maps. Too much to say. You should really give this game a try? The most I like about it is that you level up. You gain additional damage, guns, ammo capacities and stuff. Buy it! P.S. You can 'arrow to the knee' a T-REX and build turrets! :D P.P.S. You know what would make this game hell? A FLYING BOSS DINO!
3282	1	a	Ran over a pack of raptors in a Humvee. Later, while running away, got my head chewed off by a T-Rex.  10 of 10. Would play again.
4877	1	a	A bit buggy at this stage, but at its heart a bundle of mindless fun!
6334	1	a	Not bad, can do some more improvements on the graphics but the gameplay was EPIC
4555	1	a	This gud game make me happy, fun playing with friend.. ( can i get spiral coin without paying real money? maybe i can get it with complete a leve? )
3832	0	a	when i seen partial controller support i didnt think it was this bad... there isnt even a button for E so i have to put down my controller as a dinosour throws me through the air and get glitched into a wall. lol im getting off topic anyways when in wepons and adjustments menu i have to go to my mouse... the assignments of the buttons are so bad that some of the same buttons do differnt things   W8 M8. 'August 10 F2P Is Live! ORION: Prelude is Free-2-Play!  Dinosaurs, Jetpacks &amp; Mechs  PvP, Co-Op,&amp; Dueling' they been had all of this
5561	0	a	The game is as empty as my pockets
987	1	a	A truly awesome tower defense style game. Incredibly addictive and can also be a fun party game, hours and hours of fun. The difficulty level actually means something in this game, I would recommend to anyone 95/100 one of the best games in 2011 in my opinion.
3911	1	a	Just awesome, i have no idea whats going, just press play and kill every damn prehistoric motherhubber you see. Damn Turok wouldve been proud.  Just awesome.  Ah yeah ps:  â¥â¥â¥â¥ pay2style systems.

2806	1	a	Woooooow...  A dollar well spent on the most ridiculous adaption of (Halo's) Firefight mode I've ever played. It's like a cross of Firefight, Planetside 2, and Dinosaurs. If you have a dollar that you don't know how exactly you want to spend, use it to buy this.   Best played while you're high on something. Seriously.
2624	1	a	Best dino shooter I have played. Pick it up if its cheap.

3208	1	a	As i exspected turok+halo+killing floor equal a game that does need to be redone but is still fun to play anway so im not surprised i tried it its fun.
4688	1	a	Halo+Borderlands+Dinosaurs = The best 80p I have ever spent EVER!
994	1	a	an awesome tower defense that has you killing countless orcs in over the top ways you can shoot them burn em melt them crush em how ever you want to do it and the game has humor and personality and its just over the top fun to play this game and its only 15$ as of the time of this review so if your a fan of tower defense games or some one who loves indie games you should give this game a try
3437	1	a	Great Game Jet Packs and Cloaking devices; Jurasic Park gone wild!!  Highly Reccomend this game for great online experience with your buddies.
4193	1	a	It's pretty good
4032	0	a	Dinosour games should be like dinosours...extinct.  3/10  -SÑá¾á¹§
5962	1	a	your probaly asking is this game good? well if it was a regular 5$ or more game no its horrible but for 1 dolalr you get quite a lot you get decent graphics nice weather effects and the guns look pretty cool it has some vehicles and of course dinos which are good but sometimes are a pain to hit so if you have 1 dollar and looking to waste it look no further
1470	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
3945	1	a	nice game but the grapics kinda suck
1205	1	a	+nice graphics &amp; art style +well optimised and constant frame rate +simple game premise well executed +cheap +can fling orcs onto spears to impale them +replay value - trying different tactics   -repetitive
522	1	a	It was fun killing endless waves of orcs thats all there is to say. 
3446	1	a	wtf were those guys smoking when they made this
770	1	a	It's a good game, but it gets pretty hard towards the end. The sequel is better.
459	1	a	Hilarious as hell, yet very challenging and rewarding, a must have if you like orcs chopped up!
3488	1	a	Rode a T-Rex then got eaten - 9/10
2887	1	a	Three words. Guns. Dinosaurs. Kill. 10/10 - IlumminatiGN
4177	0	a	This game is garbage. The devs are shady scumbags that have changed the name of the game twice to dodge bad Metacritic reviews. Look up Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dinohorde. Those two games, and this one, are all the same. Their other game, Project Orion, was taken off steam because of a valid DMCA by Activision where these devs blatantly stole assets from Black Ops 3. And now they are trying to bleed more money out of gullible steam users by having an indiegogo campaign that was allegedly to let them fight Activision in court, but has now been changed to claim its to make up for damages Activision has caused them. Don't fall for their lies. This game is garbage. Project Orion, or whatever they decide to change its name to, is garbage. Don't give these people any money.
128	1	a	 1-sentence review :
2342	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
5616	0	a	This game is incredibly buggy and unfinished after years of the work, the dev is a hack who stole assets and actively stole money from the player's base via indiegogo.  This game isn't worth supporting ignoring all of the terrible things the dev has done, the game is unfinished, buggy and not fun.
2593	1	a	Briliante Game'a :P recommend it :)
3271	1	a	Addicting - Not sure if it is because of the different achievements - the fact that you get to shoot Dinos , the fact that you get to drive vehicles over dinosaurs.. or what ... but it is definately addicting.
6117	1	a	earrape dinos and halo 10/10
3127	1	a	metascore means nothing for this game. 36 my â¥â¥â¥. 8/10
2720	1	a	i think that this is a high quality game, the anti aliasing is really smooth and you don't see any jagged edges(even on low). Also there is a very good campaign that everybody plays, everyone on my friendslist is playing this because it's the new trend. i feel sorry for this kid whos name is listerine that got bullied because he didn't play it a lot. The movement on this game is really realistic which gives a jurassic park feel if you're on acid. Overall: campaign=:) multiplayer=:) graphics=:) movement=:)
5196	0	a	I haven't bought this game and I can write a review? That is pretty dumb.
5421	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no
3507	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
5004	1	a	i like the game. i bought this for like 20$ and it came with 3 gift copies. wife and i played it alot had a good time the only complaint i have is that you need a good graphics card to play.
4554	0	a	Didn't have any intro or any tutorial. Graphics are bad. Really, I don't like any part of this game
3794	1	a	Run, gun, fly and drive just don't let the dinos wreck your reactor or eat your â¥â¥â¥.   $1 game can't go wrong.
6209	1	a	Jetpack class runs out of fuel. I plummet to my death. 10/10 Would Die Again.
5955	1	a	I really like this one. Although the graphics aren't that great, I had lots of fun killing dinosaurs both alone and with my teammates. One of my favorite parts of the game is the wide variety of weapons you can use in-game between rounds. At first, it was a little frustrating trying to figure out some of the options the game gives us but after a while, you'll WANT to learn some of these extra features.  It's a great buy for just $1. It's definitely worth it!
2106	1	a	36/100 in Metacritic  #1 in my heart
3936	1	a	Borderlands with dinosuars.
4993	1	a	The physics are terrible- in a good way!  The gameplay is exploitable- in a good way! The premise is stupid- in a good way!  A game so bad it's good. Dinosaurs are over the top and fun to fight. The visuals apart from the dinos are almost ripped from Halo (Which could be good or bad depending on if you like that) and has vehicles almost ripped from the same source (which once again, could be good or bad depnding on your opinon of the vehicles from that game) It took the jetpack, medigun, and stealth from Tribes and a gameplay very reminiscient of Killing Floor to create a game that is so unoriginal it is completely original. Too much fun not to play.
2949	1	a	Still not sure what this is a prelude to. 9/10
3164	1	a	It's kinda like Halo2 and the oiginal Turok decided to go out for drinks, ended up getting smashed and got hoard mode confused with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥...ooops we got a baby!  It's not a hardcore fps, take it serious kinda game. For just messing about, having some fun shooting dinosaurs and flying away to safe ground with the jet pack (and who dosen't like shooting dinosaurs or jetpacks) its perfect. The gameplay is great (once you figure out what the hell you are ment to be doing....there is no tutorial), maps are pretty big, dinos are plentiful, graphics are ok too, guns are fun. For 59p you can't really go wrong! Although i now know what the guy in the toilet felt like with a T-Rex about to eat him in Jurassic Park!  8/10 Would get â¥â¥â¥â¥ out by a T-rex Again!  
6179	1	a	Best game a dollar can buy. :) Would like to play again.
6231	1	a	Fun. Isn't that why we play video games? To have fun?  This game is fun. It is also very cheap.  For 99 cents what reason could you have for not checking it out?
5006	0	a	Horrid.  You are much better off with Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day.   1/10
5723	1	a	I love the idea of the game, and i definitely recommend it IF you have someone to play it with. It's still worth the money
6030	1	a	Honestly, this is great fun. Get a few friends, yell, shoot dinosaurs and probably get straight chomped by a T-Rex. Also, there are tanks and mechs and such. The game is pretty janky, granted, but it's fun as hell.
1754	1	a	cute and easy
4551	1	a	Such a fun addicting game worth 100x the price I bought it. Deserves GOTY. What. A. Game.
3275	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2735	1	a	Really good game, recomend i highyl! You can point **** you and have a sandwich/hamburger hat, what beats that? Nothing is better than this game considering you also can dance like a boss with matrix patterns on your armor. If you want a fun, dinasaour killing game, I highly recomend ORION: Prelude
3091	1	a	Orion is a superhero in dc comics.
3358	1	a	For others I guess it could be ok, more in F2P way. For me was a bad game overall. So I'll be never going back into playing this. But maybe you can check this and see how it suits you.  This seems to be the kind of game you need to try and see the results.  
5680	0	a	Stolen game, shameful display by the developer. Do not support with your sheckles
2905	1	a	I have to say that for 1$ is a really good game... And I REALLY mean it when I say that is a good game, considering you just spend the grosseries change on 1.5 GBs of pure FUN...  And I'm serious when I say that you have to give it a try! And let's be honest, at the beggining, everything looks blurry and you don't understand pretty much anything about the game, but after 2 hours this FPS becomes very promising! The game modes, the dinos, the weapons, skills and stores are fabulous!  You won't get dissapointed.
2771	1	a	Definately ignore the MetaScore, this game is way better than however it got that rating! Great Co-Op or PVP fun, even play as the Dinos!
3900	1	a	This game is amazing and suitable for kids to play
3820	1	a	Fun Game Like Halo 4+ Dino's Great game but OK Graphics and audio 7/10
5755	1	a	LETS KILL SOME FREAKIN DINOSAURS AND STOP PLAYING...........3 hours later. I USED MY TIME MACHINE TO KILL REAL DINOSAURS but then died
1068	1	a	The main character looks like a cross between Wreck-It Ralph and Jack Black  10/10
1975	0	a	I purchased this game for about 14 cents, and while I did satisfy my curiousity, this game really began to grate me only half way through my first hour.  The concept is charming enough, and the whole project just oozes cuteness, with the sounds that asteroids make when you bumb into them to the little phrases your robots utter when they do something notible or die. Infinite lives and fairly placed checkpoints were quite welcome, While it does have the atmosphere of a first time game, and while it came out a few years ago, it's a surprisingly competant one, especially given what Steam is saturated with nowadays, although the flash game aesthetic doesn't help.  That being said, the floaty controls and precise platforming required do not make for a good time, although it doesn't start that way. Describing itself as a hardcore platformer to me indicates the controls and mechanics will be fine and precise, yet like the fleshed out flashgame it is, you won't find that here.  Following basic platformer rules, BEEP introduces new mechanics every few levels or so, and getting the super hard to reach goodies even early on demand a mastery of them. However, you're little robot friend is quickly tasked with some fairly convoluted puzzles, implementing a poor man's gravity gun that doesn't work half the time, and when it does, it controls like dead animal caught in a wind turbine. Some enemies, which you can also use the g-gun on once killed, have parts that you can't hook onto, effectively turning off your beam and having you drop it. Repeatedly. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't areas that called for the use of these enemies, or the requirement to be precise with the positioning as you're forced to move quickly instead of methodically, but of course I wouldn't be complaining otherwise. It doesn't help that the gravity implemented is a pain in butt, and although you're little robot has a jetpack in which it can launch itself in the air and decent traction when it lands on an edge, you can't use it to stabilize or adjust mid jump, leading to some frustration on already floaty controls that are mired by the fact that majority of the game is just bland chasms with chunks of platforms spread far out of eyesight.  It doesn't help that there is a function to fly, but it's purely locational, and only works when you find a pad that lets you charge it. Nevermind the fact that you can't use any remaining jump fuel to adjust, the fact it isn't a permanent upgrade, and something you have to constantly go back and recharge until you know exactly where you're going isn't my idea of fun. Implementing a metroid style progression system wouldn't be hard, and because I constantly felt underprepared no matter what level I went into left me more frustrated than anything. Combat is especially weak, and while your shield isn't awful, your gun is extremely weak. This being said, I barely managed to finish the second to last level of the first world out of sheer will before throwing in the towel, so if there are any permanent upgrades, I didn't find them. That isn't an excuse more so than it is to say that even the base game isn't great to play, and there is no driving incentive outside of seeing the next area, which is basically just a pallet swap of the last in one way or another.  BEEP is not a bad game by any means, but it's not one I can reccomend. Still, since it was put on sale because of the studio about to announce a new game. I truly wish them all the luck, and for the small amount of pennies that they ask for on sale, it's worth it just for the trading cards. Regardless of how I feel about this game, it's without a doubt better than 90% of the other crap being dumped onto steam, so hopefully they've improved over the last few years.
6396	1	a	I paid around 30 cents to.... Shoot raptors. Get a free sky tour that ended with a free sky diving lesson. Bought guns, only to realize my knife was better. Knife'd a T-Rex in the butt. Became Queen of the Dinosaurs. Worth it.
3821	0	a	Horrible balance. I watched 10 dinos attacking one soldier and it never phased him while the dinos dropped like flies to a shotgun. Don't waste your time. While I get the idea its just not fun to be on a side so severly handicapped.
1568	0	a	This game is poor... offers few options for weapons and a few updates for them. Any 'defense' game made in flash more fun that iBomber Defense.
3986	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with lightsabers
6447	1	a	From zero to hero. This game is stable.
3618	1	a	This game is awesome! It's just $1, but this game is just a gift! Anyway it's cool! Buy it now!  EPIC GAME!
5870	1	a	Best FPS I have ever played. Easy to access servers, and sooooo addicting. The only downside, is you have to deal with graphics easily just as good as GTA III. Honestly, I dont care about graphics in a game, so it does'nt bother me, but if you are addicted to COD, then you'll most likly not enjoy this game, but you have to remember, it's only $0.99. Best game I have played in a LOOOOONNG time.
863	1	a	This game is a blast, fun form the get go.. and it only gets better. Its tower deffence on setroids. Bored with those 2D tower deffence games, then give this a try..
3593	1	a	PLease, get this game, its alot of fun you can even do pvp and they are planning a new title to be announced this month or coming one.
2690	1	a	Fix the damn multiplayer bugs and this game would be lots of fun
2353	1	a	The first time I was killed I was dropped 200 feet to my death by a pterodactyl.  Fun game to play for an a short time period. I can't sit and play it at length like I can a lot of games, but if you're looking to waste an hour or so it's a great game for it.
2250	1	a	Best game ever 10/10 would play again
4887	0	a	Eh this game gets boring after 30 minutes when bullet sponging, repetitive layouts, and terrible connections plague your experience.   &gt;inb4 gr8 b8 m8
5186	0	a	One of the ''WORST CO-OP GAMES IN THE WORLD''
4181	0	a	Literally an atrocity.

5465	0	a	Stolen assets and multiple scandals.
1959	0	a	OMG this game does not worth $14.99 eventhough i bought it for $0.99. This game is so boring and low budget, kinda like Mario for 2 year-olds and boring boring and boring.
364	1	a	Battle waves after wave of Orcs in this funny fun filled highly addictive content packed Cartoony Action / Tower Defense / Strategy hybrid Indie game.
843	1	a	Insanely fun game to play! All I can really say is that ORCS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4853	1	a	GREAT GAME!!!! GOT IT FOR ME AND MY FRIEND AND ITS GREAT!!! (Is 40p on summer sale) I WOULD PAY Â£10 FOR THIS GAME!!!
44	1	a	Although not as good as PuzzleQuest (12500) it's still a fun little game. It's a mix between RPG and Poker, however weird that sounds it works. You earn special cards along the way, spells and followers and follow a storyline as you fight monsters through poker combinations. It could definently be better, more RPG elements and some new functions would liven it up. It it's cheap, it's worth it, or if your a poker and rpg fan!
706	1	a	Pure Simple FUN! Can't miss with this one!
6194	1	a	They misspelled 'Died' 10/10
3521	0	a	You are wasting money if you are going to buy this game for 0,99 cents,believe me it's not worth that money. The game is buggy and they are too many glitches,bad gameplay. Anyway it's â¥â¥â¥â¥!
1260	1	a	I rate the game 9 out of 10, 10 if there was a multiplayer option. Must buy!
1387	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
4982	0	a	I read some reviews of this game and heard it was really bad, so of course I bought a 4-pack to play it with some friends and laugh at the badness of it. I wish I didn't waste â¬ 2.24 on it, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrendous, don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, it's not worth it even with the 51% discount right now.
2361	1	a	Just buy it
4932	0	a	never let me go into a game i just looked at people and things run by
3477	1	a	This game is really, really bad, but it's also pretty fun.
3132	1	a	I wish I could pay more. It's that good.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It's great for solo play, but the coop aspect is really what makes it shine. The AI isn't top notch but watching a triceratops throw vehicles into the air around your campfire base in a lighting storm in the middle of the night while raptors go crazy down on the ground is just a feeling you can't duplicate. AND THIS GAME ISN'T EVEN ALL ABOUT DINOS! There's a ton of PvP maps and modes as well!  Just buy it and contribute to the dedicated developers who made the 'worst game ever made' into one of the greatest and probably least appreciated games of all time.
789	1	a	Tower Defense done right. Well is it really tower defense? It's a yes and no. Towers in this case are traps and you can place them during waves as well if you have money. However you yourself can also defend (much like Sanctum, in fact these two are simliar in more ways then one). Some of the early levels you can beat without usinga single trap but later you'd have a very hard if not impossible time (in my opinion) to beat the levels without using traps. Traps vary from simple floor spikes and wall arrows to flame spitting floor traps and tar pits. It's not your traditional tower defense but it fits enough for me to put it in this genre. Upgrades to the traps comes outside of the levels and are permanent. No need to worry about which one to upgrade, you do it once and it's for good. There are a lot of traps and weapons in this game, a great variety for many different strategys and plenty of replay value.
5658	0	a	This game gave me HARDCORE hemroids.
749	1	a	Shoot all the orcs!! Set traps for orcs!!! Oooooorcs!
6339	1	a	I'm recommending the game mainly because of its price point - $1.00  It's reasonably fun, albeit repetitive and the game still has some bugs that need to be worked out. But honestly, I've played games that I had less fun with that I paid $60 for - so give it a try.
581	1	a	AWESOME game but it's a little short finished it on 5 hour's ;D 
1589	0	a	Very bland and generic tower defense game. The global map offers no strategic depth at all, without any introductory or story-like element, just letting you paint the red zone into blue one by one. The upgrades of your towers is as good as nothing, since you will get them all after the first 5 or 6 missions (less than one half of a full playthrough). So the game became repetitive very fast. Only recommended for hard core tower defense fans when at discount.
290	1	a	When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
3983	1	a	The true CoD killer has arrived. For only $0.99 you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ up coloured blobs that are vaguely reminscent of dinosaurs.  Beyond that this game will give you crazy dino-fighting instincts. No reptile will escape your righteous fury. A Geko was crawling across my roof the other day and I just point blank shot it down with my trusty m16 assault rifle. No mercy.   Buy Oreo: Prenoodle for your children and watch as they turn from mewling baby into a roaring dinosaur poacher who will bring about a level 5 extinction event before they are even in preschool.  16.7/10
1400	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
1088	1	a	An awesome take on the tower defense genre, and challenging to boot. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is solid, and the traps are fun.
3301	1	a	This game is a awsome first person shooter with a great survival tatics. teamwork is one of the most importent thing in this game. Love it
1160	1	a	pretty good.
7	1	a	One Finger Death Punch pales in comparison to this holy grail of ragdoll action. Buy it now, the metascore is lying to you. You play as a guy who wears a cap that makes him look bald. Just buy it now. Please. For the sake of Bruce Lee
3038	1	a	Amazingly well done game. Tons of game modes competitive and co-op with lots and lots of maps for hours of multiplayer fun. Still slightly buggy but I'm confident the developers will be working hard to fix everything. Buy this game!
5879	1	a	This is not a good game, by any stretch of the imagination.  There's presentation and UI issues, the art assets are super bland, awful voice work etc.  But holy cow it has space marines shooting dinosaurs.  Get it when its on sale, buy copies for your friends. Load up a server, fly around on jetpacks shooting raptors and stegos with guns and mechs and tanks and VTOL aircraft.   Just have a good old time.
3695	1	a	I've recieved shots that where more fun than this game
794	1	a	There are a lot of orcs in this game. They all need to die.  The story isn't great but the game itself certainly is. The game is challenging but can also be played in an easier mode if that is more your cuppa tea. For the die-hards, there is also a nightmare mode. Finishing the game for the first time should take a reasonable amount of time (&lt;10h). The replayability is good though, the achievements are fun to try and get, and generally not of the grinding type. Since the way to play a level will completely depend on how you approach it (which traps you use, which weaver, etc) you can do a level multiple types without feeling like it's always the same thing.  It's a lot of fun to find and try out new methods of making Orc-paste (a)
5862	1	a	Just gives me a black screen biggest waste of 40p 10/10
2095	1	a	has big dinos  has small dinos has fly dinos has pew pew guns has pew pew vehicles  good game
3917	1	a	Metacritic's 36 is for a very early version of this, and is way too low, considering Dino Horde is as good as most of the popular FPS games on steam. It's like COD Zombies/Spec Ops + Halo Firefight + Turok.
292	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
715	1	a	This is an awesome game!!!! MUST HAVE!!! 
2021	1	a	if you are out of games and bored you will play this.
2218	1	a	Definitely far from a bad game. If Borderlands had a Horde Mode sponsored by the National History Museum's Dinosaur wing, this is it.
5252	0	a	I thought the progression would be more mercurial, and only vanity crap in the store.
104	1	a	Runespell Overture is essentially and turn-based RPG with a poker-hand-based combat system. You create combinations with cards that you draw to deal damage or heal. The graphics are good for an independant title, but the game has a lackluster plot and is extremely short (only 3 or 4 hours of gameplay). If you enjoy playing poker, have a love for turn-based combat or have small children who like card games, then you may find this title entertaining for a few hours. Wait for a deep price discount, otherwise you may feel you overpaid for this title.
886	1	a	Ridiculously fun game. Easy to lose track of time and actually quite challenging!
4311	0	a	Won't even start up. Tried to restart steam, computer, and reinstalling the game itself but nothing works. I just get the loading wheel then it just says it crashed :/  Honestly I was looking forward to this game but now, I can't even play it! Quite dissatisfactory.
951	1	a	The launch trailer was made to 'The Hall of the Mountain King', performed by Apocalyptica. If you need any other incentive, you are a strange man indeed!
2078	1	a	Ah yes, Orion: Prelude, or as it will always be known to me, Orion: Dino Horde! This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.  So, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).  This game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.  So, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!
5372	0	a	Worest Game Ever
6338	1	a	Well I've had this game for a while now and this is my two cents on this title:  This is a fun game both solo and with others. There's quite a bit of content, more so given the maps fromt he workshop if that's your cup of tea. All in all I enjoy playing alone and with others from time to time. It's something different then your normal MMO type game, such as swtor, maplestory, etc. If I had to name what game this reminds me of, I'd have to say, torok, DinoiCriss, those kind of games. (forgive me if the spelling is a bit off, it's not one of my strongest subjects)  However there are a few down sides I've noticed. First there is the ability to join players even when they picked solo. That to me is kind of pointless, here's why. If someone clicks solo they did so to play alone not to play with others. I've done that a few times pre-prelude, meaning back when it was still dino horde. There wasn't a way to make it private or put a password on your game, at least not that i ever found. That is the frist con I have found with the game. However this has been fixed from what I've seen as now you can name a server you create and lock it with a password, make it private, and truely play alone. So that con has now been outdated with the release of prelude.   My next issue is more of something I've managed to do and I do not fault the game's play ability for it. I have just managed to get to lvl 55 on one of the classes. Now mind you I did this using an xp grind map from the workshop, but using the new prehistoric settings found in prelude sdkbeta. The issue was found after I hit lvl 50 and is still going on. My frame rate drops to the point that the game freezes. This could be the map, even though theres not much of anything on it, could be how fast I've been killing the dinos, could even be that it's a bug that happens else where in the game. I have done nothing to fully test this lag/frame rate drop. That is why it's more of a personal issue since I can't blame the game without knowing if it's happening to a lot of people. However there is a warning sign before it starts getting really bad, while in first person, you will see your body move around in front of your point of view. In 3rd person your body just rotates while your crosshair and bullet lines still seem to be aimmed where they were before the body starts to rotate. This maybe a small matter on my end or witht he map I was using, but it is troubling that it's only started doing this at lvl 50 when I'm using the prehistoric difficulty setting.   Other then all of that I give this game a 9 out of 10, the 9 is simply because I have yet to play all the maps that come with the game normally. Still one of the best games I've played involving dinos that is a 3d enviroment. Keep up the great work, and I'll keep recommending this to my friends. ^w^
6070	1	a	Pay no attention to the 'metascore' as it does not reflect this game at all. At the moment I have just finished my first game and it was awesome. It reminds me of Halo mixed with Turok. I figured out most of the controls within five minutes and was soon blasting away dinos. If you want a fun game that can also present a challenge then I recommend this for you.
837	1	a	This game is pure fun. It strikes a tough balance between having traps that are underpowered making the player do all the work, and the traps being overpowered leaving the player with nothing to do but sit back and dodge the bloodsplats. It's always a frantic rush around the level picking off the few stragglers and strategically thinning the ranks with a crossbow or magic spell.
679	1	a	Gameplay is similar to tower defense games, but instead of towers, you defend rifts. You prevent orcs from crossing the rifts by setting up traps AND fighting them using your crossbow/blade/spells (3rd Person). You can also customize your warmage (minor spoiler) by using the weavers, which give specific boosts whether you prefer casting spells or being crafty with traps.  Highly recommended for the casual gamer, it's easy to pick up and go. Maps typically has 15 rounds which take no more than 3-5 minutes each (much faster if you are good)
1038	1	a	fun good game... not worth 15 bucks but not so bad for 5-10
1550	0	a	This game is fun, but until they actually do something about the aweful coding, dont buy it OR get it on consoll, it's hardly doable on pc as it is now, I have sent them an e-mail about this but they dont seem to care...do we really wanna support such bad service?
6165	1	a	It's like skyrim with Dinosaurs
1534	1	a	Warp is SO much fun! The top-down style of puzzle is very clever and fun! If you liked Portal and Portal 2 but wanted something a little more casual, this is definitely the game for you! I have only played about 73 minutes so far and only have three abilities but it is a ton of fun to play!
1265	1	a	A solid isometric action game of the mech kind that's challenging and fun enough to demand a sequel. There's a 25 level campaign with three difficulties, and a three map arena challenge with three difficulties. There's also mech upgrades, aesthetic upgrades and pets. It's over five years old, and with all the isometric garbage out nowadays, I petition for The Butler to return!
3288	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.
2473	1	a	Oh man, this game.  Let us begin with the very beginning of this game.  It was â¥â¥â¥â¥, just utter â¥â¥â¥â¥, a friend of mine couldn't even play the game back then because when one of us hosted the other couldn't join, we were frustrated by this and thought the game was horrible. We regretted ever buying this game and shelved it for all eternity. However, I remained faithul and watched the development going on from the shadows and I must say, good job Spiral Game Studios! You have shown people they you are one of the few developers that actually give a rats â¥â¥â¥ about your game and want to make it bigger and better! Gone with the DLC crap, you buy the game you get the updates and DLC for free! Period!  I salute you, with the new updates I have gained faith in you again and the news about the Orion Project gave me new hope, I just installed the game again and will try it out, a full review will follow afterwards and I wish this will be my most favorite game, because the new additions are so many for me it should give me a lot of time to try them out, not a fan of PvP but that is my opinnion. Full review coming after real gameplay.  Also, for all who see the rating of Metacritic, that was when the game first came out under a different name and was utter â¥â¥â¥â¥, give it a try, show your support to these awesome â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, show them that Indie developers need more support then right corporations that care only for the money and not its fans!  Extended Cut; So, I played some more and got into a solo match of Open World, man is that snow coming from the skies? Is that a fricking T-Rex walking around not noticing me? What is going on!  I quickly found out that Open World is Open World, a place covered in and by snow, it was snowing when I spawned but after a few minutes it vanished, so I took my jeep, went to the generator and saw it was a generic survival mode, activate the generator and hold out, pff, easy I thought and so it was, I was bored and got the Cryo Blade (Lightsaber) and oh my gosh this thing is powerful, two hits against a mobs head with the 2x damage boost and you are set to go solo mode. Now, why would I continue playing after I defended the generator and have to go to the outpost? Easy, five huge beasts to slay with my trusty VTOL, now the VTOL is great and all, but if you DON'T kill the flying dinosaurs you are pretty much screwed, they chew away your VTOL's armor and the fact that T-Rex throw rocks at you, start flying boy. So, after I got downed I tried to fight the T-Rex who got his little T-Rex friend AND army with him to fight me, eventually I died and thought; 'Screw this, it was fun.' And to my surprise I could revive by killing an enemy, which was awesome, also could my shields regen after I got hit a few times, which worked only once because I got overwhelmed again. So, after a minute of fighting the T-Rex got me and digested me, woops.  Also, the fact that there are chests and cabinets with money and/or weapons in them is a neat idea, first loot and then see if you can buy a better and bigger gun, a great idea for people who just hop in and need a bit of extra cash to win the battle!  All in all I give it a 9/10, it is a great and awesome game and they did a great job, the snow effect made for some intense fighting because my vision got blurry and frozen as soon as I stepped outside, which made it harder and more challenging, I won't give the 10/10 until I actually play some multiplayer matches with random people and friends and see how it works then, overall a great game if you want to test you luck and survival skill against two T-Rex's and their little buddies, next time I bring my own army of four with me and see how long they can survive against us.
2628	1	a	Good game, TERRIBLY OPTIMIZED  the game is FUN don't get me wrong but... running around at 2 fps with the lowest settings on MY computer means something is VERY wrong.
2681	1	a	Get past the general generic feel of every aspect of the game and it is actually quite fun, plus theres always killing a T-Rex with a lightsaber.
5796	1	a	Picked up 4 copies for 2 bucks, got hours of fun with my friends.
4475	1	a	didn't know i had this game 10/10
2716	1	a	perfect blend of crazyness halo openish worlds and players
3223	0	a	HOLY CRAP! This game is amazing. There are no words to describe the fact 1$ and so amazing. And, it's on Unreal engine... so that results in stability.  I unfortunately at this moment, cannot recommend this due to the fact it currently doesn't have linux support. I'll be able to change this when it does.
6244	1	a	YOU GET TO PLAY IN A SYFY ORIGINAL FILM HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥  I GIVE IT 2 TANGERINES/APPLE
5963	1	a	It seems that I can NOT buy the 4-pack for my friends, now that I have purchsed a copy for myself, just so I could check out the game before sending it on to them.   This may just be a Steam Store problem, which I think I have run into before this purchase attempt.    Merry Christmas or Happy Thanksgiving, depending on which is being advertised first in your locality.
6130	0	a	This game... is broken and laughable.. want a laugh? sprint and look down at your legs flailing around... it's only a buck so... if you've got money to spend... go ahead
4052	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
4195	0	a	needs to be optimized for amd graphic cards
3229	1	a	for a 99 cent game i'm suprised at what i got a chance to shoot dinosaurs in the face with my best buddy's  but other then that really don't go expecting the meaning of life  so for just an awsome mulitiplayer-dino-killing game, its worth the 99 cent tag as an evening game to be played with friends
6270	1	a	tecnically is not a good game, but is really funny
358	1	a	Highly recommended for the fans of the genre.
1371	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
142	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an outstanding, well done Indie game with excellent, quick and ongoing support in the Steam forums by Robot Entertainment. This game can be played several different ways, so there is great replayability. Examples: 1) you can play just to complete the 24 War Mage mode levels followed by the 24 Nightmare mode levels, followed by 5 levels more for each if you own the DLC, 2) you can playthrough to '5 skull' all the levels, and 3) you can playthrough trying to achieve higher or top scores by using different combinations of traps. You MUST, however, make sure you have at least a dual core processor as this game heavily uses the second core for its animations. I highly recommend this game!
416	1	a	Simply put, this game is huge amount of fun. It's an excellent blend of tower defense and action, with an almost comedic atmosphere. If you like hack &amp; slash and/or tower defense, I highly recommend you take a look at this game. Actually, I recommend picking up the franchise pack since both the first and second games are a blast to play.  Comparing this game with its sequel, I liked the levels better in general in this first game, but the second just has a lot more stuff including a second playable character with different traps and abilities, more monster types, and best of all, coop. So do yourself a favor and just get the franchise pack.
5048	0	a	Most terrible piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the internet ever.
5823	1	a	cant get my money back 10/666
854	1	a	Awsm Game!
4598	0	a	I can't even joke about this. One of the worst games I've ever played.
31	1	a	I honestly think this is the first computer based card game I have ever played. I have always passed them up thinking I would never enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. This truly is a well developed adventure. You essentially create poker hands against opponents to cause damage. The battle animation sequences keep it interesting to watch plus there are a decent number of card options, including offensive, defensive, and special abilities. As long as you understand how poker hands are ranked, this game is masterfully intuitive. If not, they even have that covered as well with an easy to follow tutorial. It also has a decent story although it's all text based so there is a bit of reading involved (you can skip conversations if you prefer). Do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.
805	1	a	Simple and addictive, set traps and shoot big green bad guys. Brilliant.
5531	0	a	CANCER + HIV = ORION: PRELUDE
1173	1	a	Watch 'em dyin'
2322	1	a	I had a difficult time choosing if I wanted to buy this game or not. Sure, it's only a dollar, but I guess the guy behind it pulled some shady dealings, so I couldn't decide if I was okay with that.  After much though, I came to the conclusion that a buck was worth giving the game a try, and I'm glad I did. While there are still a few bugs in the game, it's fun and refreshing. I didn't realize just how much we really needed a dinosaur game!]  If you can overcome the moral arguement of the game dev, and overlook the outdated metascore, this game has a lot of potential.
3148	1	a	While the metascore may seem off-putting, it is COMPLETELY misleading. Great for a night with your buddies; fast gameplay interspersed with 60-second breathers, craploads of weapons, and multiple game modes to keep it fresh. The only problem is a slight lack of polish, but the game's wonderful mechanics shine through every time. In short: Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is fun!
864	1	a	I felt like dungeon defenders was a cooler version of this game, orcs were kinda lifeless and the traps and weapons didn't offer much satisfaction when slaughtering the enemy.. for me a game needs solid foundation and this one didn't hold any emotional connection to the mindless action.. but theres more action goin on in yer parents bedroom. I'd have to say this crap is wack, and the second game might have improved to a better standard. the intro video got one good laugh and that I will never forget, but I have moved on from this heaping pile of dog fecal.. to better things. 1/10
1577	0	a	Crude and unrefined tower defense garbage. Looks and plays like a smart phone app. Absolutely disgraceful to release this as a PC game.
6311	1	a	i cant believe this game is only worth a dollar. only problem is theres definitly a couple of bugs some of them a little game impactful meaning they can take some of the fun away. For example if you get into the air vehicle and used the minigun towards the end of the 'mission' your camera in-game is permanently stuck zoomed in and is extreamly annoying. what i mean by permanent is that even when i restart my computer its still not fixed. BUT besides the bugs from what i played has a great PVE experience in round based dino shooter, and no the dinos are no pushover to your technology there is a challenge.  Edit: just found a way to fix this bug buts its a little inconvient. Deleat your local files from the games libray and reinstall the game, i did make a backup file for it just in case so i wouldnt lose anything so keep that in mind but it might fix it even without the backup file.
563	1	a	good if you want a timekiller
4571	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!!!!  Even stronger than Jurassic World ;)
4988	1	a	Well firstly,I thought is S**t,then i bought it and it was really cool,i do recommend this game
6178	1	a	I really love this game :) good game to play with your friends or people online :) little hard to do by yourself but still fun nontheless :) Can't wait to level up more on my Assault character!!
366	1	a	6/10 It's a pretty dull Tower Defense game (replace Tower with Trap), but at least the opportunities grow with your inventory. Still, it's fun every now and then. But not as much fun as Plants vs. Zombies. *hint hint*
1645	0	a	Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game. This is an unfinished program with no vision. Your only purpose is to pilot around from randomly generated level to randomly generated level finding better upgrades so that you can kill the enemies in the way more easily.
1834	1	a	Its a fun game, good to get your mind off things :)
2310	1	a	Definaltly one of the best, most funnest multiplayer games and fps games. Don't listen to metascore. I have no idea how they gave it a 36. It deserves like 106! Just get it. GET IT NOW. You need this in your life. You won't regret it.
5819	0	a	While there is nothing actually wrong with this game, there is just no reason why I would want to play it over left 4 dead, killing floor, or TF2's MVM. It's OK but if you're in the mood for horde killing there are better games out there.
2809	1	a	The game is incredible, it have a lot of dinos to kill :)  Pros: Have multiple classes ( assault, support and recon ) Have multiple game types ( survival, conquest, duel and so on .... ) Have multiple vehicles ( car, jet, tank, APC and so on ..... ) And ofc the game is constantly evolving ( char-class lvl and the game it self )  Cons: few minor glitches needs menu interface polish :)  overall - 7,5/10 ( at least )
6476	0	a	These idiots need to update something because i cant â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ play, it crashes too much
5261	1	a	This game is the bomb diggity with friends. &lt;3
4992	1	a	Greatest game ever produced, the greatness is so epic, I am not worthy enough player to purchase such a godly title.
2222	1	a	The metascore may be low, but this game is real fun with friends
5279	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a $1.20 (that being NZD) thrill for a weekend. After a few years (and occasional name changes) this game is pretty good for a while. It's as the description tells clearly a Humans vs. Dinosaurs game and aimed at a multiplayer audience. ORION is best played multiplayer with friends but does have it's issues such as a fairly small community. With a variety of vehicles, weapons, dinosaurs and maps it does have a sense of replayability. However this is let down with technical flaws like a terrible framerate and poor optimization and the feeling of it just getting old fairly easily.   The game has it's flaws, however is still easily one of the best games you can buy (better than Bad Rats anyway) when you have a spare dollar in your wallet. It won't satisfy you for long and the multiplayer may be dead, but it's still worthy of being a 'blue moon' multiplayer game if you have friends that are willing to play it.   Pros  - Fun for a while. - Cheap - Has a good variety.  Cons  - Unoptimized - Small Multiplayer Community  Rating: 6.5/10  P.S BreakfastBae leave this Review alone.
3379	1	a	This game is soooooo underrated its not even funny. I bought i for myself and three other friends and played it. I have to sa that i didn't expect to play it for 5 hours straight. Its amazingly fun and has many game modes. I was also impressed witht eh amount of detail the developers put into the game, the simple fact that you can play the newly added map and have to worry about your visor getting iced up is so funny and cool. The game is much better than the meta-score entails. If u read this before the free week is up try it out, and definately try out conquest. I would say more but i would be here for a while :D
1225	1	a	Tower defence in a nutshell. You protect a portal from invading orcs that come via air or ground. You have several traps at defending this portal at your disposal. As you progress in the game you can upgrade these traps and gain access to more. As the hero, you are capable of assisting the traps with a crossbow, a sword, or magic which can also be upgraded as you progress.
2492	1	a	Very Fun game for that price. MUST BUY++++!!!!
4182	0	a	Orion: Dino Hoard is an extremely bad game. I also think it's pretty cheesy. It's just a wave defense game featuring dinosaurs with bad servers and a dead community.  Bad gameplay, bad online multiplayer, bad story (it's non-existent), bad production value, bad developers, bad time.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  **Do not buy Orion: Dino Horde!!!!!**  And this ignoring the fiasco of how bad it was when it was Orion: Dino Beatdown and then having the developers change the name to get rid of the negative stigma (and reviews) surrounding the original game - this is a review of the current game on the market! It's terrible.  Don't take my word for it though:  Reviews:  Impulse Gamer - 4.5 / 10 - 'Dino Horde is not the improvement Dino Beatdown needed...it never feels like a finished product...this goes deeper than just a lack of polish...rudderless.'  NZ Gamer - 3.0 / 10 - 'Shoot in the back of the head and bury it. Awful. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Unplayable. Abomination. Broken.'  Gamespy - 1.5 / 5 - 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs in the same game? How could this possibly fail?...the same way as if Jurassic Park had used sockpuppets for the dinosaurs and someone had accidentally set fire to the final reel mid-way through the premiere.'  IGN - 2 / 10 - 'Painful. You probably deserve a beatdown if you waste your money on this disaster.'  I cannot recommend this game in any way, shape, or form - it's not even a worthwhile gag gift for a friend. Don't even buy it for your mortal enemies as the developers are shady. ORION Dino Horde is a stain on my Steam Library and if I could remove it I would. It is easily the worst game in recent memory that I've EVER played and I have no problem giving it an F
1725	1	a	HELP I'M STUCK!!!   http://i.imgur.com/ijtcKNp.png   This game is some puzzle game you see in floating around somewhere in a vast desert. You enter it and try to play it in some unintended way and now you're stuck inside it so completely and the only thing that can advance you forwards or back out is to glitch the physics in some hilarious way. And the whole damn maze keeps spinning and you use your jetpack and it just keeps spinning even harder. You use your anti-gravity to hold it in place and try to turn it someway so you'd fit through the next tight crevice you're stuck in. And it continues.  I feel both the gun and the enemies are a bit unnecessary for this game, unless you could fight them using your anti-gravity to fling objects at them. I have yet to know if there are bosses, but I haven't seen one in the first level yet. This game would benefit from physics based combat.  And the best part about this game is the physics, whether it gets clever or wonky. It's the kinda game you can make your own humor with. Something funny is bound to happen.  This is an amazing game for its price. Buy it! If you get this for 20 cents, the trading cards you sell even pays back this game's price, making it essentially free.  Hint: To reach a high place, stand on an object, jump, fling that object up at your feet, then jump on it to do a 2nd jump in the air.
6378	1	a	This game is only 74 cents and its free to play right now? Might as well give it a shot.....  HOLY CRAP I WANT THIS GAME!!!!  This game has dinosaurs, lots of weapons, driveable vehicles, and huge maps. I highly recommend this game and since its only 74 cents, its a steal.
1448	1	a	LOVED Shank 2, never played Shank (Is there a Shank). Oh well this game was fun and action packed from beginning to end and it was a great difficultly level for this 40 year old gamer. I have really been enjoying these side scroller games alot as I enjoyed Ninja Scroll just as much. This one was a lot less on the stealth and much more on the action. As an 80's kid who grew up on kick @ss action movies like Rambo this one was right up my alley!
1863	1	a	I say this with no sarcasam at all. this is possibly one of the best puzzle platmormers I have played to date. I genuinely recomend this
1335	1	a	Play it if you are a fan of side scrolling beat-em-ups.
5314	1	a	Don't listen to all these call of duty fan boy haters about the relaunching of this game and the art theft or whatever. These guys have been making a great, super cheap game for a long time now. Yeah there have been some ill advised copying of armor or gun art from other games, but â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens. The game is 99 cents, no one is getting rich over it.   That being said, this game is worth every penny. If you don't have a lot of fun blowing up dinos with your friends in this game, there is something wrong with you.
5330	0	a	3/10
3790	0	a	Its like Jurassic Park, Halo, and Call of Duty had an abortion. Nothing else to say about it.
1314	1	a	A Fun, simple, throw back of a Beat Em'Up. It has wonderful animation and is somewhat of a challege. Fun for the whole family.....except for toddlers...
6235	0	a	The poor implementation of concepts has bugged this game ever since it was first called Orion: Dino Beatdown. What originally started out as a flawed game has now become a mish-mash of ideas, that is in my opinion unplayable. Whilst the ingame character, dinosaur, and vehicle models are terrible, graphics are not always everything. Well then, why is this game so poorly optimised that it lags on high-end computers? What's worse is that this game borrows concepts from other video games, and doesn't quite manage to properly implement them. The vehicle steering system is like Halo: CE, but 100 times worse, the second chance system is like Borderlands 2 but with no real challenge. Honestly, the best thing I did with this game was uninstalling it. I want my internet back, I want my wasted time back, but am I going to get them back? Answer: NO! Seriously, save your money and buy a game like Primal Carnage or Dino D-Day instead. Both are good examples of a humans vs dinosaur game done right.  My Score: 15/100.
3808	1	a	It has dinosaurs, lasers, guns, and swords.
222	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.  The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.  There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre.   8/10
3245	1	a	Good indie Sci-Fi shooter! Kill all these Dinosaur hordes!
5139	0	a	when you paid for the game
4359	0	a	Gun shoots are not really that real, need a long distance of running before jump into action, abit of boring game.
2661	1	a	The ratings on this game through youtube and a couple other places are pretty bad but I think this game is amazing. Sure it has a few quirks, as all betas do. But I can't seem to get enough of it. Well done!
2662	1	a	Awful, yet also awesome.  The game is not well made, even on a good machine with solid internet connection it will lag.  It's not smooth, and the AI is kinda dumb. The modes simplistic and the enemy cheap.  With a few friends (and it helps to have a drink or two in you) it's an absolute barrel of laughs and fun. Play for the dino mayhem and slaughter. Don't play to have a good intelligent shooter.  Grab a gun and go shoot a raptor in the head. Rinse and repeat.
2542	1	a	Best dollar I have spent in a long time. The CoOp is a ton of fun.
2687	1	a	Honestly, if my PC wasn't â¥â¥â¥â¥, i'd play this more
2540	1	a	TL;DR: It's fun, frequently updated and generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. Wait for it to go on sale though, because the gameplay isn't worth the full price.  I was a bit scared when I picked up this title because of all the bad reviews it was receiving, stating that ORION: Dino Horde was one of the worst games ever made. After I watched a rather hilarious german gameplay video, and the game was on sale for less than 2â¬, I finally decided to get this game.  First of all, we've got to set the record straight: ORION: Dino Horde IS NOT the same game as ORION: Dino Beatdown. This should be a no-brainer, but unfortunately many people will still post bad reviews mistaking the previous Dino Beatdown for Dino Horde.  Dino Horde is a mutiplayer action game in which you have to kill off waves of dinosaurs and defend buildings. Between those waves, you're able to upgrade your loadout and perks by spending money which is earned in a TD-like fashion by killing enemies. The general concept is rather simple as is the gameplay. When fighting on foot, the gameplay consists of rather monotonous gunplay. Because the dinosaurs are generally faster than the player, movement and celever positioning don't really play a role in fighting. The only real variation lies in the different enemy types of which some require different strategies to kill. The game also includes vehicles and vehicle combat, which is a pleasant relief. The graphics are rather good considering this game is a low budget production, but the map design can be monotonous from time to time.  The strengths of the game lie within the co-op aspect and the frequently updated content. Since the launch of the title, the developers have included multiple new game modes, some of which deliver a rock-solid co-op experience, as well as other additional content.  This game isn't the next big multiplayer co-op shooter, but it definitely has it's moments and is generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. The price of 13.99â¬ isn't worth the experience though. If this game goes on sale anytime soon, you might want to pick it up for some hours of multiplayer fun.
5896	1	a	this game was fun! i paid 50 cents for it and i love it!  its perfect for a simple shooter with your friends, theres several different game modes, differnt classes of waepons, bunch of maps. its perfect for getting into shooters its not to complicated and its not too bad looking either~  definatly worth a the dollar it costs~
2474	0	a	suck.
2526	1	a	Get this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you pass it up. I'm not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kidding get it.
4549	0	a	it sucks  
3972	0	a	Kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ but still dumb entertainment, recommended for the $0.99 price tag as opposed to the $14.99 price tag unless you are dumb enough to buy it at that price...
1462	1	a	I havnt spent alot of time playing Shank 2 and havnt played Shank but its a fun game and reminds me when I used to play metal slug in the arcade. Fun game.
5615	0	a	I never really liked ORION but now that the devs are trying to rally people against Activision for taking down their game when they stole assets makes me actively hate it. Do bot give these awful devs your time or your money.
2967	1	a	This game is really fun for a cheap game and I enjoy it! stop for looking negative comment you should try it!
1971	1	a	Very fun, visually asthetic, pretty much bug free. CHEAP! Get it
3491	1	a	If you love Horde mode, and you love dinosaurs, get ready for the ride of nothingness, because this game is terrible.  EDIT: OK, it's currently a dollar. You can't NOT buy it for a dollar. You and 4 friends can get down for less than having 5 on it. You put FIIIIIVE on it. Dino Horde; get Steam Keys. You put FIIIIIIVE on it. Play it on that low end riiiig
6114	1	a	Worth the money when I bought it (1â¬)
2576	1	a	It has dinosaurs, and you shoot them..... 10/10
2597	1	a	Fun, bought it on sale, easy to pick up and get right into it after a bit. Worth full price IMO
2685	1	a	*Friend Shooting T-Rex with Minigun* *Rams T-Rex and gets the kill*  10/10 would steal dino kill again
582	1	a	I did the happy dance when i first played this game. Do you wanna do the happy dance?
3320	1	a	game is fun to play coop. Good for playing with friends.
1440	1	a	Even better visuals and re-invented, more fluid combat. About as short as the first one, but the co-op survival mode adds longevity and is a lot of fun, especially with a friend. If you liked the first one, you'll love the sequel.
1105	1	a	What a fantastic game. I really love it. Fast paced action combined with some strategic thinking, a healthy dose of Bruce 'Ash' Cambell style humour. Devilish traps and some well thought out weapons. This game has also really has made me laugh a lot. A very enjoyable and polished game that you can have a quick game of or spend hours playing. So much fun to be had and lots of replay value.
3749	1	a	Very fun and addicting game. Lots of game modes to keep it interesting.
2389	1	a	Quite possibly the best wave-based dinosaur FPS's ever.
2110	1	a	It's fun with friends for a few hours every so often. you're crazy if you don't pick it up for this price.
2960	1	a	This game is aweosome for a 1 dollar game, great game for if you feel like playing something new but dont feel like spending alot of money
5490	0	a	LIteraly good
5417	0	a	Firstly, all respect to the developers.  This is a game that started out bad. Like, really bad. One of those bad games you remember, yeah, you know the ones.  It's only that this time around the developers said 'Hey, we made the game, let's like, fix it and stuff.' Then they did. Then they added billions of loads worth of content. So much so they renamed the game about 2 (or 3) times based on how much they updated.  There are tons of maps, modes, weapons, and just variety in general that should make this game a jurassic clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of nonsensical fun. Why 'should' ? Because beyond all of what they have added, all of what they have continued to put into the game, I canno't for the life of me enjoy it.  Why? Well it's probably gonna seem stupid, but I personally think it makes a big difference.  Every single weapon is simply not enjoyable to use and makes the game feel boring and bleak.  Everything feels like a pop gun with the volume put to 2. I swear to god that sometimes the guns make literally no noise at all. They designed these huge awesome looking assortments of weapons, but they all feel so static and weak it's a joke, and aside from that there is very little feeling of actual impact when shooting anything.  This is seriously a big problem that hinders the entire game unenjoyable, or at least for me. I mean come on, this is supposed to be a giant battle for survival against huge, glorious dinosaurs, but there is nothing-- NOTHING about doing anything in this game that's at all fun to do.  This should be so easy to fix, and I hope to christ they make an update to the game that completly reworks weapon animations, sounds, and effects, because as of now it's loads more satisfying to fling rubber bands at a picture of Jeff Goldblum.  Also the occasional heavy lag and frame drops don't exactly help out.   Is the game worth a doller? Well to you and some others it might be, but there is nothing here that can bring me back unless they just update the guns to make them feel like actual, powerful guns.
3701	0	a	Very basic shooter, I got... Well 0.3 hrs in according to the game timer. And the game client crashed. And I've seen more than enough. This is another game I suppose could be fun in a lan party or something like that... but it might be worth the 99 cents they're asking for it while it's on sale this week... If you're bored....
2585	1	a	nice fps games ... worth to buy
5902	1	a	10/10 would punch a T-Rex in the mouth again.
2027	0	a	it's anoying... the gameplay, the sound (except the bird sound, that's awesome), the enemies it's monotone, and not more than any free online flashgame
648	1	a	Not as good as the first.
4377	1	a	awsome 
2054	1	a	A+! 5 Stars! 10/10! It's wonderful in everyway!
4909	1	a	If you combine Call of Duty Zombies, Halo, Turok, and Jurassic Park, you get this game.
2347	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
185	1	a	Is good game. Play very well orc kills. Recommended in holiday children times.
746	1	a	Its not the most 'serious' looking game, and does look rather idiotic, I've enjoyed every second I've put into this game. Its got a great playthrough value, and the replay value is solid as well. If your looking for a fun semi-tower defense game, then this is worth checking out. Its all single player, but check out the second one for co-op!
4689	1	a	its not GREAT but i mean you can kill dinosaurs, and face it, how many other video games can you fight dinosaurs in? for .99 i would get it
5625	1	a	I fell from the sky shooting rockets at a t-rex, rockets won.  999/999
4563	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphics and Textures and Really boring
5365	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Want to shoot one? want to run tiny ones over with a car? this is the game for you. if you come in expecting nothing this is a great game. you kill dinos, you get money you get bigger gun to kill bigger dino's. good little shoot em up highly recomended.
5430	1	a	Game seems alright, but whenever I shoot, there is no animation for the gun firing. One of 20 shots works. I'll update this later if it seems more smooth.   I bought 4 copies for $3 so I still recommend the game, if I can squeeze 45 minutes of gameplay out of my investment, this game owes me nothing.
3576	1	a	Best game in the village
482	1	a	AWESOME. there really isn't another word for it. crazy addictive, fun, rewarding with a little bit of carnage thrown in. if you like the 'tower defense' type of games you're going to love this game. On top of that its crazy cheap for what you get. I highly reccomend it to everyone
1830	1	a	Interesting game if u want to lose 1-2h. U can try it sometimes.
5408	0	a	don't  just don't    Tip: IF YOU SEE A GAME WITH 'MIXED' THE CHANCES OF THAT GAME BEING â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS LIKE 87,25%
3951	1	a	I took what appeared to be a Future Tractor with a jet engine strapped to the back of it and proceeded to run over a line of 10 velociraptors, at which point I ran headfirst into a T-Rex which decided it was time to throw me and Future Tractor 300 meters through the air. Future Tractor didn't survive, but I somehow made it and then took my laser sword to some more dinosaurs.  10/10
10	0	a	Install it, Tries to play, The game crashes, uninstall, reinstall, still doesn't work Money Wasting Simulator 11/10
301	1	a	This is one of the best and engaging Tower Defense games I have ever played. It mixes third person shooting and trap placing strategy so well it couldn't be done any better.  ÐÑÐµÐ½Ñ ÐºÑÑÑÐ°Ñ ÑÐ°ÑÑÑ Ð´Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ°, ÑÐ½ÐµÑÐ³Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ, Ð±ÑÑÑÑÐ°Ñ Ð¸ ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÑÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ Ð½ÐµÑÐºÑÑÐ½Ð°Ñ. Ð­ÑÐ° Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ° â ÑÐºÐ°Ð¹ÑÐ¸Ð¼ ÑÐ²Ð¾ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¶Ð°Ð½ÑÐ°.
2494	0	a	This game is great......for a good laugh. Though the laugh is not really worth $1.
2626	1	a	My friends told me 'you could buy a bag of chips, or this game' and you know what? I would rather have that bag of chips. Honestly, this game is crudely-made and minimally optimized with gameplay inferior to Killing Floor.   However, if this were 2008, I'd rank this game a solid 9/10.
498	1	a	This game is fun! The combat is clunky, but very nice and meaty. The variety in enemies, traps and weaponry is also quite impressive. Also, it's a pretty good challenge. It is kinda repetitive, though, and the campaign will only really take you about 12-15 hours. For what you get, though, it's definitely worth the $10/Â£7.
6479	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this the greatest game ever for $.99. Hell, it's the greatest game ever in general. 10/10.
2933	1	a	It's cheap, decent and almost always on sale. If you've got a dollor to spare have fun.
6107	1	a	Great game for the very low price (depending when you buy it) Dont trust the metacritic score
4615	1	a	Best game I have ever played in my entire life. My single life goal is to become a dinosaur and attack furturistic humans that have outdated weapons and jetpacks that last almost 5 seconds.
3903	1	a	Great game! Ignore the meta score! Lots of changes have been made and you are missing out if you dont spend a buck to buy this! Better yet buy the 4 pack so you can give some to your friends.
1075	1	a	It's a fairly simple game with a fairly simple concept, but it's fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥. You play as a mage killing orcs in numerous tower defense styled maps, that's it. I give this game a 3/5.
4503	0	a	This game is so bad, it's like watching Louis Smith doing maths and english AT the SAME time.
5081	0	a	Okay, so. Basicly your a dude who fights humans and waves of dinos. Pretty cool right? Wrong I didnt like how it was, there was nobody to play with and it was really boring.
2688	1	a	Dinosaurs. Do I need to go on?
2249	1	a	Don't let the metacritic review stop you from getting this game. Great buy with good multiplayer and forces you to work together or you won't survive.
618	1	a	Hands down the most fun I've ever had playing a tower defense game. Got this on sale for $0.99 and it is definitely worth every penny!
3408	1	a	Cheap and awesome
5010	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.
2055	1	a	I bought it to troll my friends while they were in a very important game of H1Z1, always when they are in the top 5 left and it alt-tabs the game to see  'Your friend has gifted you BEEP!'  *Friend dies in game*  10/10 would kill my friends again for 20 cents
4252	1	a	Did you love Turok on the N64? Did you love Halo when it was cool?  If not, still doesn't matter because this game is pure fun.  This game brought back sweet memories when I used to play Turok 2 on the N64 and then when I played Halo CE for the first time on PC.  You haven't lived if you haven't punched a T-Rex till death with your bare hands.  1$ and tons of fun!
4669	1	a	This game is awesome! The idea of the game is that dinosaurs are trying to eat your team but you all have a different idea! Blast your way to victory! I really like how you can do like in Halo and have one guy drive another shoot the turret and as many people as will fit ride along and shoot there own guns like mad! It is really awesome when a T-rex grabs your car in its mouth and trys to eat it with you in it! Eventually it just throughs the whole lot up into the air! Tons of fun and you can play with your friends! The gameplay is awesome and the grahpics are too, especially at maximum! I defenitly recmomend this game!
1200	1	a	Fun, clever, and just the right amount of arcady. I hope they make more like it.
6344	1	a	In 2014 I downloaded one of the worst games of all time, however I found out 6 months after buying this that it was in fact a decent game.   Pros: Fantastic gameplay Good environments No bugs or issues found (so far) Dinosaurs vehicles to run raptors over in  Cons: Character models look like something from halo 2 (2004)   This game is fantastic to play with your m80s, the co-opertative gameplay is well refined.   
3860	0	a	This game is fun to play. IF THE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WOULD WORK PROPERLY FOR ONCE
2854	1	a	I wish my T-Rex would evolve and get himself an automatic weapon but I guess throwing rocks will have to do. Fun game for a buck and young kiddies like it too. No complaints but hopefully with the next update the raptors will finally get jetpacks...eating guys in space suits sure beats licking tacks.
6371	1	a	It's really tough to explain the appeal of this game. It is unbalanced, kind of repetative, a little akward, but also gloriously fun. For about 4 hours. And for a dollar that is great deal.
213	1	a	Awesome game. very fun. Recommended!
3908	1	a	Suprisingly a very fun game. 7/10
6033	1	a	Amazing game. Would recommend to anyone. Dinos and guns, the childhood dreams.
3533	1	a	Great dinosaur arena game eventhough the meta score is low i love playing it with friends. There are ten different types of dinosaurs and six different types of vehicles. You have to make it threw a few rounds and capture a couple outposts to win the game but all in all it is definantly worth the money it costs!
520	1	a	Incredibly fun! It's plants vs. zombies on overdrive! Set your traps and watch the fun!
5229	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
1929	0	a	Only got 14 minutes on this game but let me tell you dudes that this game is UBER COOL. Even my soon Sam loves it.
2749	1	a	This is one of my personal favorites.... you get to kill DINOS!!! Not to mention you can run over other dinos with jeeps.
5505	0	a	This game costs real money...
4382	0	a	Why did the name change and re-download. No. I got this because I thought it was funny. It runs poorly.
1017	1	a	An outstanding take on the tower defense genre. The game offers genuine choice as to how to complete levels, and the variety of levels as well as the decent challenge will keep you drawn in. It takes 8-10 hours to finish the campaign with good scores, and then there's Nightmare mode to contend with. Highly recommended.
6176	1	a	Great game to play when you love to fight dinos!
5795	1	a	1-Make sure you buy weapons xD   2-Let others hit the flying birds. lel  3-fun to play.
745	1	a	Awesome Trap-Defense / Third Person Shooter. Excellent art, good balance. Lots of gameplay.
5587	0	a	laggy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
6377	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing addicting as hell and its only a dollar, BUY IT, it seems silly but that is part of the charm, you have a ton of weapons and the vehicles are badass and its just a fun romp shooting dinosaurs in the face  and the upgrades are useful and add another nice element to the game, even if you only play it a few hours youd hav spent more at an arcade on much worse games no?  do it just to shoot a TREX IN THE FACE!!!
788	1	a	I picked this game up cheap in a bundle and was very surprised at how very awesome it is. It combines FPS, tower strategy, and humor in delicious proportions. I find it hard to quit. Each level requires its own analysis to determine the best defense, the options are endless, and I don't always get it 'right' and get overwhelmed the first time through. A perfectly played map leads to total personal satisfaction. Orcs Must Die can be played casually in 15 minute bursts, but it is easy to get sucked into multi-hour sessions that leave you tense, sweatry, and carple-tunneled out.
3556	1	a	A must have Coop game to play with your fellow friend, family and your lovely girl friend. -Character customization and gender! -Hot graphic! -Ton of vehicle to drive and fly! -Large map to run around! -Time cycle and Weather systems! -Big dino! ETC  Cant believe this game cost me just 1$! Where are the donation button. 
1190	1	a	Killing orcs. What's not to like?
1637	1	a	I'm not sure if I or the game makers were on lds. Why I enjoy it this much? :D

432	1	a	Try it In MasterMode thats a GAME! of slash slash and BOOM! HEADSHOT! really worht it!
1313	1	a	Amazing game + need players to play with.. in survival mode
2135	1	a	This game is no where near related to it's metascore. First of all, this game has gone through some intense updates that have made it insanely fun. You have the Unreal engine (Which is very good), The Halo-like multiplayer, and YOU CAN KILL DINOSAURS.  TLDR: I ate my friend as a T-rex and I don't think I've ever heard anyone â¥â¥â¥â¥ themself over the mic. 11/10 It's OK - IGN
5611	0	a	A poor game all around by a developer with very questionable practices, I'd avoid it.
6001	0	a	Let me just say there is a good reason that they only show off community reviews on the store page: every slightly educated video gamer knows this is a functionally bad game. The metacritic score is correct and should not be tampered, and no this isn't a different game than the Orion before it. While this game has many features, none of them work together in the slightest. It seems as though this is just a marketing scam for a garbage game that tries to attract every single 10-year-old shooter player. I played during a free weekend, and I can confidently say that I will never look at this title again. I wouldn't pay 5 cents for it.
3191	1	a	You get to play as a spartan, using lightsabers, to fight dinosaurs.  Need I say more?
6325	1	a	aye they were probably drunk when they made this game but its still amazing
1202	1	a	4 out of 5... cool traps, decent different types of enemys. NOT MANY LEVELS... you can get many more from dlc I think u should try this game
5541	0	a	scummy, asset stealing, game rereleasing devs combined with a horrible game = not reccomended
4012	1	a	In a lot of ways, this isn't a very good game. However, it's incredibly fun, and there's a lot of attention to detail.
5129	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ old dino shooter. cheap but gets boring quick
635	1	a	Very addicting game, well made, good for killing time.
4773	1	a	10/10 got butt â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by a T-rex
4717	1	a	A pretty awesome game I bought a year or two back, back then it awesomely sucked. You could walk through walls and the textures looked like super mario 64. Today me and my friend (that bought the game too) were bored, we thought about this but it just seemed TOO bad. Now, after I tried it , I can say this game is amazing. Its incredible to see how they developed it from a crappy dumb game to an actual good FPS . I was skeptical at first, but this game is ******* awesome. 
3234	1	a	Probably one of the best games i have ever played.

4641	1	a	Its like Skyrim but with dinosaurs! 10/10
5519	1	a	Good dumb fun, let your brain take a breather as you run around shooting dinosaurs in the face. I don't know why it's so fun, it just is. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it. For the price you can't even play an arcade game for 10 minutes, and I got 7 hours out of this so far.
3550	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
5957	1	a	you got my respect game
5832	1	a	its a great game 
4898	0	a	I do not recommend this game considering it was gifted to me by a friend to play early, now they want more money again. Something wrong there. Not worth it as far as im concerned.
6478	0	a	So you are thinking of buying a Dinosaur FPS... for $1. What does that mean? What can you expect?  This game is heavily based on Unreal Tournaments invasion gameplay mode, you and a group of other people spawn and try to 'protect your base' from swarms of varying types of dinosaurs. Some are simple to spray and smear, others require larger amounts of bullets, etc etc.  Does it even stand out from mods you can download for unreal?  Personally... I enjoyed the little bit of it I played. While half of the features I was expecting to see didn't exsist or work, the game itself worked like you'd expect. Aim gun, pull trigger, watch dinosaur get mad/die, rinse and repeat. Some of the dinos had some entertaining bugs, but overall nothing too special.  What makes this game a bit interesting is the melee system they added in for PVP. It almost feels like PVK (Pirates Knights and Vikings) with about as much hit detection issues. It's laughable, and in some cases terrible. But strangely I enjoyed the experience (probably because I realized I got the whole mess for less than the cost of a humble bundle minimum).  Would I recommend this game? Not really no, as honestly your money should mean a bit more to you than to waste on a game that already exsists in another franchise. But if you are bored, have a buck, and wanted to waste a bit of time trying to play a game that doesn't really have that much to offer, I guess you couldn't go too wrong.
845	1	a	Loved it!
6075	1	a	A lot more fun than I was expecting. Being able to fight dinos in a mech suit is amazing.
2366	1	a	fun and amazing I love it. one of the best Dino games I've played
902	1	a	This game is cute. Good personality, good graphics, satisfying traps. challenging to build an optimal route. Only a few kinds of enemies, the 'gotta shoot them in the head' thing gets annoying after a while.
2476	1	a	I bought this when it was Orion: Dino Horde. I LOVE this game!! For 0.99$ its is worth it, actually its a rip off to the developers! This game hasa hours of replay ability and it is still being worked on,  so the people claiming the ai sucks, shut your trap, msot people who claim it sucks have little time on it anyway. Its a great game to play with m8s or random people online. It requires stratagy on higher levels and good teamwork. 11/10 In my opinion, anyway its only a dollar and you spend 20$ to buy cod 4 still.
3371	1	a	Now, I'm not going to say this game is great. It's pretty good. I enjoy playing it. But only the survival mode, usually on my own aswell. The rampage mode, where you play as the dinosaurs aswell, is buggy as hell. Humans are way too op. Can't wait for the Prequel, but right now, I'm not amazed. Still good game doh.
4559	1	a	this is a great game. even if you dont play it you should buy it just because of what these guys have achieved here. to take an absolutely terrible game and turn it into this is just magical!
2196	1	a	If there ever was a game that combined Aliens, Dinosaurs, Space Marines and robots etc. It's this... People may say it's a bad game. That's because it ain't your avarage shooter. I love this game, and the first time I saw it, I said 'I want'. It may not have a storyline so far, and It may just be matches fighting people or Dinosaurs but it's so much fun and great all the same. Dino Horde is reguarlly updated and is about to 'evolve' into it's final stage, Prelude. And I can't wait, so far it's one of my favourite shooters. The company may be small but it has made a great game. There are tons of Dinosaurs you can play as and fight. Tons of customizations, weapons and weapons and vehicles. One thing annoys me though, you can only play team eliminations and free for all's a lot when it goes on sale for $1. When it's not on sale, all you see is survivals and conquests and very rarely a Duel or Gungame.  It's still worth your money and attention. I would recommend getting Orion Dino Horde! (Also like how I heard T-mass on their trailers)
5614	0	a	This game is Literal â¥â¥â¥
1952	1	a	hello everyone, i hev pleyed this gem all me life and it is very fun good gem. this gem tjenged my laife is very good game.
3819	1	a	if you like survivel games this one is pretty good along the lines of cod zombies and killing floor to name a few. this game breaks up the dull wave by wave play by adding objectives, cap the out post and kill the large boss dinos or the wave will just keep respawning. all in all this is a pretty good buy.
3501	0	a	Wouldn't recommend it but can be a fun distraction. Depending on what you like you can find some enjoyment out of it.
4426	0	a	you gotta kill the dinosaurs but like all you gotta do is get a choppa then its GG so don't buy this POS if you wanna play for any more than likeeeeee 2 or 3 hrs 4/10
2770	1	a	This game is really fun
190	1	a	This is actualy a really neat game :D the hurmor so far is pretty funny, the gameplay is exceedingly fun, and really makes for a good mix of stratagy and action! so if you like tower defense, violance, and action (run around and shashing up stuff/shooting stuff..) games this is a fun game to get :D
3090	1	a	Well for a dollar its worth it
3993	1	a	i say 50 50 and this is a RE releash to put it  This is just a name change and more updated game (just saying) it was called   But back to the point it is a fun good old game  i say it a good game you may love it i find it fun and enjoyable i mentioned the top so you would know but i find it more fun then Cod Ghosts to put it it has a lvling systems and 3 classes
995	1	a	I downloaded the demo on both Steam and XBLA and was so blown away that I jumped at the first sale of the game on Steam and fully intend to get it on XBLA whenever it goes on sale there as well. Definitely one of those 'must own' titles for me.
4516	1	a	i love it I GET TO KILL ALOT OF TREX 
2351	1	a	This is a great game, it's has alot of playibility due to workshop. Multiplayer is great and graphics are good
2503	0	a	bring the pizza
5138	1	a	Fifty-fifty
1759	1	a	This is a very interesting game! 'BEEP' is a game for kids who want to learn some smartness! :D
1480	1	a	Nice game
2171	1	a	Quite a bizarre experience, actually. On the one hand, this game is very buggy and unbalanced, its sound design is just weird... BUT on the other hand, you are killing (and roadkilling) a handful of FAHKIN' dinosaurs and flying around using jetpack. It's kind of like a mix of EDF, Halo and maybe a little bit of Tribes. It could be better but it is good for what it is. ...why do I even enjoy this
3758	1	a	This is the best $1 i've spent since i boned ur mum
4994	0	a	THIS STUCK DAM T-REX CAME AND ATE ME 
5767	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. They didn't even try to pretend it wasn't.
5820	1	a	+This game exceeded all expectations for 39p this game was well worth it's weight in gold and i would even go as far as to say this game is better than most full priced crap out there.   -Microtransactions.
4314	1	a	wtf is this game? It`s so funny, that i slapped my mother so hart in the face, that she started laughing too.  10/10 would slap my mother again for this game!
4726	0	a	The frame rate was horible, but its probably just my computer. I dident see an Open World gamemode only a Humans VS Dinos mode but i only played for 3 minuits because it was too laggy for me. the game looks really cool (the open world part) but i cant play it on this computer so i returned it.
1741	1	a	A fun physics puzzle / exploration platformer. I am enjoying this quite a bit. Some of the puzzles are challenging, but so far most are extremely easy to solve. I hope they increase the difficulty a bit once I land on other planets. The desert definitely ramped up the difficulty. One cool thing to me was it was written in SFML using Box2D and some other stuff, which I hadn't seen very often. Definitely a cute, fun, casual game I'll hopefully beat some day.  + Cute graphics / story + Very fluid and simple controls + Beautiful example of Box2D physics  - Kind of easy so far
5586	0	a	this game is still â¥â¥â¥â¥ like ages before
1436	1	a	Had so much fun playing the first that I picked up the second one. So much fun too! Hoping there's a third, forth and fifth!
29	1	a	Fun little card game. Nothing special, but try playing this instead of reaching for your solitaire game.
4418	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
814	1	a	This game has soul. A 3rd person shooter/tower defense mix, the traps are neat, the levels are fun, and the dialogue is frikkin hilarious. It has a moderate learning curve, so dont expect to get perfect scores on your first play through, but it grows on you. A high level of polish, great sounds, animations, and design make this a great game worth the price. 9/10
3053	1	a	This game is hilariously bad. The raptors will spawn right next to you and you can kill hordes of them with one clip. It's awkward to shoot because your gun doesn't recoil most of the time and for what ever reason the boss dinosaurs always attacked me. I can say the best part about this game was being grabed by the pteradons.
6349	1	a	I got more fun out of this than Call of duty black ops II and I put together, best dollar i ever spent!
424	1	a	The game is hilariously fun. Wanton destruction in the most tasteful way, a veg game without being a veg game.
632	1	a	Kill some orcs
2029	1	a	boring
5159	0	a	This game is so much fun for a couple of hours. When you play it with friends. Then it loses it's luster. It's got a nice premise, but it is also repetitive. As I'm writing this, I suppose they're adding more content. That should do the game a world of good. The graphics are nice, but the controls need some work. I have an Xbox 360 controller that didn't seem to work with this game. It was still alot of fun, but I can't imagine playing this alone.
5581	0	a	I got this game when it was called Orion: Dino Horde. It was garbage then, and it is garbage now. Do yourself a service and don't get it.
6297	1	a	ok this is a not a bad game, for what you buy it for worth the money.  all i can say is iv had more fun playing this with friends, we had some good momnets. (pos) good game, good grapics on max, wepons are ok,  (neg) i think that fact you just shoot things theres no story. the grapics only look nice when it rains. and the characters coustomise is to limated  so i rate this a 7/10 
3074	1	a	Thosands of Dino's, lot's of guns, good multiplayer, lots of gamemodes (One is almost an open-world kinda thing), 420/10 Fun Game, reccomend to all.    In a Doni-Shell: It's Worth Playing!! (If you have a good PC 'cause this game eats your CPU and Memory more then John Belluci and Cheese)
1672	1	a	I wouldn't call this game a hard tactical shmup as it's on the level of an easier Realm of a Mad God. Anything can become the stage as you can enter another level by hopping into the up arrow tile/manually enter a powerup on the ground/enter enemies or hell even your ownself. A good game to pass the time but I wouldn't call it a difficult shmup.
2951	1	a	Your character spouts nonsense about pizza while your friend shoots dinos while in a giant mech. Out of room in the truck? Just run into your friend and take him along with you.  10/10 Bring me some pizza
3362	1	a	Funny. I liked it very much! :D
3180	1	a	i dont even know where to begin 10/5 would not play again
4662	1	a	Hell, if I didn't have ping problems, it was 9/10
3837	1	a	I don't understand the hate that this game gets, though I had never played the earlier versions as I am a new player. The value this game has at 99 cents is very high in my opinion, with a decent variety of multiplayer modes, weapons, maps, enemies, vehicles, and more. The addition of AI teammates is a plus as I enjoy playing offline shooters. The scenery in the game is very well designed. Its not the most technically sound shooter I have ever played and it is not quite the kind of game that I could sink a large amount of hours into, but anyone who nitpicks a 99 cent game too much is taking things way too seriously in my book. I genuinely believe this game is better than some FPS games that I have paid $60 for in the past.
4421	1	a	It's not a deep game, but a very fun one. If you combine this with the good gameplay mechanics and decent graphics, this is a really good investment for $1.00.
6083	0	a	crappy game, boring bad graphix
3046	1	a	Game is bull shavick. I stood completely still and the T-Rex still saw me.

2725	1	a	I stabbed a dinosaur to death with a combat knife.... 10/10
2591	1	a	Great game! Bought it for myself, and after a few hours of playing, bought the 4-pack for my friends, Good job!
501	1	a	If you want to fight hordes of Orcs and can't afford Warhammer 40k then this is your game! this game is fun with an awsome soundtrack that causes cavities of the brain.
5532	1	a	this game is a very good game many fun i have had with other people meeting the community it's fun yeah buy it.
3882	0	a	Dont buy this 'game', not even for 0,99$. Not only is the game an unfinished, bugy piece of trash (even after YEARS), but the devs have shown on so many occasions that they are just in it for the money, and that they are willing to do EVERYTHING in order to milk the last cent out of this horrible 'game'. I could ramble on about how they tricked consumers into buying, but if you are interested just google it yourself you will be slain by articles of fraud claims etc. Total Biscuit reviewd some earlier version of the game, his review is very accurate.
1031	1	a	Now this game I spent hours on my crapy labtop, Just killing the dam orcs all day made my own day.
4679	1	a	super fun game but it needs work it has stability issues with random crashes and im geting 40 45 FPS but wan it works super fun i hope they add more guns maps and dinos
4622	0	a	Orion: Dino Beatdown is an entirely broken FPS.
857	1	a	Best story ever. Needs movie adaptation. 12/10 Would bang again.
1715	1	a	Very fun game, flawless controls and great physics. Feels much more than 25 cents.
2162	1	a	amazing game 8.5/10, me and my friend had invested in this development in order to find an amazing first person shooter. it was on sale for 99c, so we thought, why not. it was the worst game we ever played, so after 1 hour, we immediately uninstalled. Coming back almost a year later, we both downloaded it, as we had heard of the word that it ha totally and utterly transformed into a monster of a game, and we thought, 'How on earth could this be?' We came on to have a bunch of giggles, fun, suspense, action and glory,.....   Biggest transformation i have personally seen in a game.  Great Job game devs, hats off to you lads.  - Good ol' dusky
2124	1	a	Surprisingly fun for its price! Feels good to play this.
1481	0	a	And why do I not recommend this game. EA's Origin! Never even got the game running, 20 minutes of painfull Origin create profil, login, enter game serial. Run game, login again, enter game serial once more, game crashes, start game again, login yet another time, game crashes, reboot windows, run game, login just for the sake of login in, game crash, uninstall!  Steam, would you please ban EA Origin games!
5876	1	a	I never in a million years thought I would be dino poop in space. 11/10.
4047	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
6006	1	a	Excellent idea and design but balence is terrible. If you do not pick the support class you are bad as not only are you the tankiest character but you also have a healing gun. The other two charcters only get a jetpack or a really lame invisiblity power, and anything else that seperates them has a go around.
3595	1	a	This game... i was extremely skeptical at first. But after playing it for a while, i'm in love. Definitely worth a shot. BUY IT!
4738	0	a	This game seemed good, but the graphics suck and it doesn't tell you how to do anything, such as buying new weapons. Also, the dinos horde around you after like 2 rounds and its pretty much impossible to escape that. DO NOT waste you 49 cents on this trash.
2836	1	a	Those who critisize this game do not really get deep into the gameplay. I personally like this game very much. You can experience a different type of FPS game by killing dinos with friends (and the multiplayer game is quite smooth). And you know what, this game costs only 1 dollar (and is even cheaper when you buy a 4-pack). Please don't compare this game with other which costs you more than 20 dollar!
5362	1	a	Its awesome! But how do you buy stuff with your credits you earn?
2567	1	a	Nice game, having lots of lag issues though, that needs to be fixed. (its the game because i have no problem playing other games)  this game is awesome to play with a few friends or just by yourself. this game isnt challenging at the start but later on you will die a couple of times wich is good, it keeps the challenge in the game. the graphics are great (although i have to play on lowest graphics because of the lag issues)   everything summed up a bit: buy this game, its awesome. but you do need a pretty decent pc to play without lag
5651	0	a	This game is suck. GGWP
2275	1	a	Definatly worth 99cents
1610	0	a	Game well not start Ive sent three email asking for help
2970	1	a	Seriously just go buy this..Loads of fun and it's practically free..even in SA..
2995	1	a	its just awesome plain and simple
6347	1	a	Super cool devs even though the game itself may not be the most fun thing in the world. Would recommend if you are at all interested in shooting dinosaurs in the face with halo guns.
3735	0	a	This game is tragically bad. The creators should drink bleach.
5394	1	a	  i dont remember this game all that well. it may have been during a free weekend or maybe i just got a refund.        idk.
259	1	a	Something about the fact that the orcs die purely for my own entertainment creeps me out a little. And also makes me a little giddy on the inside like my big brother just won me a prize at the carnival by throwing baseballs at sad clowns.
4677	0	a	This game is terrible, luckily it is the type of terrible that you can laugh at, do not buy in uless it goes under 2 bucks
5660	1	a	hate for no reason good game to play with friends 
968	1	a	Damn, this game is fun. I'd play a lot more Tower Defense if there were more like thisâ just the right balance of strategy and fast-paced action, especially on Nightmare difficulty; also, the dumb humor hits just the right note.
1399	1	a	this game is boss buy it and feel the power of tequila
5650	0	a	crap bob poo and infected pee
5340	0	a	It....really is just poorly made. But it is what it is: a humans vs dinosaurs game, and it honestly is nothing else. Don't buy this expecting a solid experience: it's buggy, clunky, audibly empty, and not very pleasing to look at. It's a pre-early-access title, meaning it had the same principle of early access before early access was a thing on Steam. Don't buy it unless it's on sale for like, 99 cents, which often times happens with this game.  Fun fact: this game had a different title when I first bought it years ago, which really says something about its development.
2583	1	a	If you are looking for some good clean fun with your friends ORION will give it to you. Nothing fancy, just A LOT of Dinos to be killed. Although a bit lacking in the graphics department and such. Still worth the $0.99 price tag.
6315	0	a	The spec's need to be re-written. My computer is much more powerful than the Recommended System specs And I lag on the main menu, As well as in game. Fix this.
2026	1	a	good game.. dark regions are annoying though
1485	1	a	A really fun little game that's well worth buying, despite the EA account nonsense. There are some great game mechanics in use and the puzzles are pleasantly challenging. It manages to be both cute and gory at the same time, too. Should note: I was playing with a controller (which works great), so I can't vouch for keyboard controls.
479	1	a	Great game - marries tower defence and third person shooter mechanics in a nice, polished package.   Recommended!
5177	0	a	i have just four words to say DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
634	1	a	Orcs must die is a tower defence game and third person shooter wrapped up into one.  The plot is as simple as it gets. There are two worlds, our world, and the orc world (insert warcraft joke here). They are connected by rifts, which allow travel between the two worlds, and for magic to flow into both worlds. An order has been set up to protect these rifts at all costs, using massive forts filled with traps to stem the hordes. You are a thick beefcake trained by the best old man the order had, before he died, it is your task to defend the rifts and keep back the hordes.  The meat of the game is wave based tower defence, where in you spend mana to set up defences along lanes in order to protect the rift from any nasties trying to get through. You yourself are loaded with weapons as well which allow you to take an active roll in the defence of the rift. You have a set amount of slots with which to select your tools of death and are locked into those until the end of the level. Weapons and traps both take up a single slot, so choose wisely.  Its a difficult but extremely satisfying process, going through each wave and being careful with how you plan everything out, from basic trap set up to the shooting mechanics, every enemy is dealt with in a slightly different way, with no true stratagy to perfectly stop the incoming hordes, you're always moving, always setting up new traps, always doing something. Its chaotic, but rarely overwhelming to the point where its impossible to handle right up until the end when you've failed to make the optimal trap set up somewhere or haven't been active enough in your own personal combat against the creeps.   Visually the game is very cartoonish, everything is very clean and it goes well with the cheesy comedy aspect, really hammering home the fact the game is light hearted, which is fine. The music scores, while not the greatest pieces, are memorable and even weeks later i can perfectly remember the main theme, i personally found them fantastic, but your tastes may differ.  The game overall was a wonderful experience from start to finish, being one of the most addictive games i've ever played in my life, and it was also the first game i ever played on PC, forever bringing me into the folds of the PC master race. I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fast paced tower defence game, or third person shooter with heavy focus on not doing all the work by yourself.

What do you do when the community rages at you for it, do you:  A: Create new art assets completely from scratch. B: Smash the bugs as quickly as possible. C: All of the above or D: Rename it something else, add another game mode, and don't do anything else?  Well, these folks went with choice D.  D, For Don't Buy. Not Dinosaur.

4384	1	a	It has dinosaurs. What else can be said.
1771	0	a	In BEEP, you are in control of a small robot that is used to explore other planets. It is mostly a platform game with slight action and puzzle elements. There are basically zero options provided to the player as far as graphics are concerned, and the game engine seems to have serious problems with frame drops and performance on a modern computer. The general presentation is basic, upbeat, lighthearted, adorable, and for all ages. The world map is amusing, as you are allowed to navigate through space with your ship and bounce off asteroids or space debris. Each planet looks different than the other, and the levels appear to have been designed well. The controls are implemented adequately, and are quite responsive even in the more dire platforming situations mixed in with some shooting or the tricky anti-gravity device. The robot's wheels also have an excellent grasp on terrain, which makes for some forgiving moments if you are new to the genre. All of this is not without some major problems related to performance. The game runs terribly on a modern computer that more than meets the minimum requirements. The massive frame drops, excessive lag, terrible slowdowns, and extreme choppiness make it unplayable. Others have experienced similar problems, and proof of it can be found in the game's Steam forum. This is actually quite unfortunate, as BEEP seems to be a good game at its core, if it weren't for the performance issues that break it. Perhaps with some developer tweaks and patches, BEEP will live up to its full potential and be enjoyable.  BEEP is mediocre.
966	1	a	This game is incredibly satisfying. The character is hilarious and the traps are really fun to watch as they slaughter millions of orcs. Some later maps get very hard and there is no endless mode.
2552	1	a	Decent FPS to hop into with friends for quick 30minute sessions
3244	1	a	Awesome game, 9/10 only thing i could suggest is more work towards controller work.
5997	1	a	Another good PVE Co-Op shooter. Easier than the others I've played due to the implimentation of vehicles, but effectively this is Halo with dinosaurs.  Mech suits, lightsabers, and t-rexes. Lots of fun co-op.  The shooting is alright as well.
5851	1	a	This game is by no means a sophisticated shooter. It is however a fun spray and play kind of game. Ideal for a LAN and to just shoot and drink a few.  Bang for buck, most definitely!
4720	1	a	Orion Prelude is a weird game, you either like the game or completely hate it in every way, but for $1 i had to try it out and in my opinion its a decent game. Its not utterly terrible, but its not an awesome game, its an all around fun dino shoot em up. If you have a couple of spare bucks then by all means try the game out, if you like Halo and Dinosaurs then this is your type of game.
3343	0	a	Here's all the 'strategy' in this game, fill a dino with bullets, buy a bigger gun, fill a dino with bigger bullets rinse and repeat.
4868	1	a	Have fun with your friends or the bugs or both.
5211	1	a	BUY ME THIS GAME YOU FOOSERS 
2223	1	a	I think I shot a dinosaur and it moonjumped into space, came back down to Earth at break-neck speeds, and survived impact only to land in water and drown.  Why aren't more people playing this, again?
3816	1	a	Great Game. Played with some friends. Some Guns are a lot mor powerful than others so if you pick and choose right you will dominate!
2100	1	a	Budget wise this is the best and most fun coop shooter I can think of! I bought this game for many of my friends since its so cheap and we always had alot of fun playing it. I dont regret a single second spend playing this game.   10/10 would buy it again.
1717	1	a	This game is actually quite good! Whenever it goes on sale for dirt cheap (pennies to a nickle I mean) then give this one a chance.  All around took me about 3-4 hours to complete.  Overall there were some fun and interesting physics puzzles that require a good grasp of platforming.  It's all cheap, clean, and has really nice challenge to it at the end of the day.   Pick this one up, Ladies and Gentsï»¿
3610	0	a	I played the 'game' for 30 minutes. I put game in quotes because i can hardly call this a game by definition. Honestly i have no idea where to begin with this horrible excuse for a 'game', so i'll start with the interface. I was greeted with screen prompts made for a 360 gamepad. I didn't even have a gampad plugged in mind you, apparently I am supposed to use a gamepad instead of my keyboard. Even if it was a port to PC, which it isn't, why would they use 360 controls as the button prompts?   Next, i tried to join a game; 4 times, each time unsucessful. It displayed a list of servers you can join, but may of them had a ping labeled as 'lobby' tell me, what exactly is 'lobby' ping? I finally gave up trying to join a server with people in it, and decided to join an empty one just to get into the bloody game. Hindsight being 20/20 i should have just shut the game down, and unistalled. It was free however, I was naive and wated to give this 'game' a chance. How very foolish of me.  Upon entering the match, the sound was bugged. I kept hearing a repeating sound of some sort of dinosaur trying to bite my head off every 10 seconds or so, even though no enemys were to found anywhere nearby. I had no idea what the objective of the gamemode was, but it displayed an enemy generator and friendly generator health bar, as for what the hell these generators did, I couldn't honestly tell you, but somehow my team's was down to 10%. I shot a couple pterodactyls and raptors; which I could barely see because it was on some winter level, and apparently my character didnt have the ability to wipe this all consuming frost from covering his entire visor. Seriously, it was like someone took a jar of vasaline to my characters face and went 'off you go! time to kill some dinosaurs, i think!' Very shortly after, the game crashed, which was the best part of the game in my experince, BECAUSE IT WAS OVER.   Honestly, just 30 minutes of this game gave me a headache, and im pretty sure if i kept playing i would have had a brain aneurysm. Do i reccommend this game? That is a hearty and concise NO. I don't care wether or not this game is in alpha, beta, or what have you. If you are going to allow people to play it, make sure it is actually playable. 
5539	0	a	played five mins, on the menu that is, worst than cod with its host migration. Got a single player game to go, but it crashed before it got to the loading screen.
6131	1	a	Ask yourself this, can you really go wrong with a 99 cent game?
1914	1	a	â â â â â
1692	1	a	Nice, colorful, platfrom game with peaceful music.   One of the best games for 1 euro.
4197	0	a	Beware this game is not for everyone.  I give it 6/10 and here's a few interesting things about it.  The game feels like a Halo 1 mod. The locations, the power armor, the weapons, most of it's design choices. You could pretend you where playing master chief and you'd feel somewhat at home.  There's a reason for this beyond the art style. It's because many of it's game resources where lifted or âstolenâ from Halo 1. I've played Halo 1 for 5 years give or take and I've really got to know the game, it's physics, it's weapons, maps, everything.   Playing Orion: Prelude I saw a warhog, then I saw the exact same animation when you get off the turret. Then I saw animations from using the melee button from guns. You also realize for a new game it sure looks like it came out in 2001 same as Halo 1.   I had no idea this game was a kickstarter, and it's a perfect example why I've never supported a kickstarter and probably never will. (including paid Early Access).   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/orion-prelude/description   The number of things they say in the Kickstarter and it ends up just all being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Even the in game shots look nothing like this game when you play it. Just watch the video and then compare it to screen shots and videos of the actual game. They promise things like a deep lore, etc. I'm sorry this is just a Horde mode game, and a easy one at that.  The game itself is lots of mindless fun, but so many other games do everything this one does better. There is no sense of challenge, you can easily go on a mountain and shoot all the dinosaurs out of range. You have many weapons and augmentations you can buy to make turn this game into Very easy mode even on medium settings. I can't say for the higher settings.  The game does lack polish. Things like getting stuck in graphics, warping dinosaurs, unpolished animations, etc. When I said it feels like it's a Halo 1 Mod, it sure does due to it's unfinished quality.   The creators are already on their sequel so I wouldn't expect this one to be polished, they probably learn that from EA games.   In itself the game can be lots of mindless fun, but don't expect anything amazing, just like a cheap mod, it's fun to try out, but rarely better then the original.  A few annoyances;  One thing I'd like to point out, you know how in Halo 1 the sniper rifle leaves a white trail, well in this all the bigger guns seem to, so after a while you only see cloud lines and not your target so well. Then you got rain on your screen, you know the dripping water, I was never a fan of this. And in this game it's constant. There are a number of things that make it harder to see your targets but it's mostly just annoying and pointless. Especially then it's raining on your screen in third person view.   I bought this game for 1$, I would be willing to pay up to 2$ but no more. If you want a good horde mode game I'd say Killing Floor tops this hands down.   This is the type of game you have fun messing around and shooting easy targets, but you'd probably never recommend it as anything worth wile. Not â¥â¥â¥â¥, but not great.  
5575	1	a	Maybe this is the beset game
3266	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with. Anyone that enjoys a good fps, whether it be pve or pvp should give this game a shot.
4150	1	a	Muahaha.. its free to play this game now!!   i got this 2 months ago, then refunded it 'cos the game wasnt played nicely on my pc. Multiple crashes in the game, laggy in some parts.  Should just lower the price to .10 cents so those trading cards will still get drop.
254	1	a	Orcs must die! is fun to play and has epic music.The warmage also has some funny things to say during gameplay.
4385	0	a	download this game

2584	1	a	Fun game that costs less than $1, what more could you ask for?

3669	1	a	The sky makes me lag. The ground makes me freze. The enemys make me die. I think my computer came from the time of the dinosaurs. plz fix my computer.
4362	0	a	A never ending party game
2058	0	a	I'll start by saing BEEP is probably worth $2. My negative recommendation is not based on the monetary cost. I wouldn't recommend BEEP simply because I don't think it's worth the time you would put into it. Pretty much every part of BEEP can be considered 'just good enough,' but the game lacks polish in all departments. The graphics aren't bad enough to be offensive, but don't really bring anything to the table. The controls are adequate, but it's pretty obvious no effort was made to tighten them up or make them any better once an acceptable implementation was found. The level design adequately makes the player use the game mechanics in the way they were intended to be use, but it seems like no one went and made the small adjustments to improve the gameplay ever so slightly. Overall, it's just okay, and personally I don't think it's worth the time or effort.
1803	1	a	A fun little game that is quite simple but still makes fun. Recommended if you like Puzzle/Indie games.
733	1	a	Great tower defense style shooter.
5026	1	a	Few bugs there and here. Little bad frames, but you kill dinosaurs.  I give it T-Rex/10
1615	1	a	Very cute puzzle platform game, if you're into that sort of thing you should check this game out.  The controls are simple, jump up and move sideways. You collect keys to open 'doors' and interact with items in the levels to achieve the goal of reaching the end of the level.  It's a simple game with a few obsticles which take a big more thinking and precise jumps to figure out, but nothing as intense as super meat boy. It took me about 5 hours to perfect the game.

1963	0	a	dont buy this 
2402	0	a	This game has brought me enjoyment it is true; from its derpy triceratops to its 'laser swords' that definitely were TOTALLY original. This game has brought me joy, not from its gameplay but by the pure BS that the developers have pulled to make this game into the guano it deserves to be.   The graphics look like they should run on a potato, maybe 2 potatoes if they are small. The guns are ripped from other games and it is frustrating to see that there was a complete lack in creativity during the development of this game.   I bought the game on a whim because all I would be losing was a dollar. Is this game worth what I paid for it? Not entirely based on the fact that the servers always dropped connection or that it took several minutes to boot properly. After playing this game for the amount I did, I am not sure if it can ever 'run' properly. I laughed at the shear derpiness of the dinosaurs rather than enjoying the game itself and that is worrisome for me because now it just sits in my library. This game just taunts me now and I wonder what else I could have done with that dollar.
3560	0	a	There is a reason this game is 99 cents, because it's god damn awful.  The voice acting, the gunplay, the driving, the dino AI, and the PVP. Pvp is â¥â¥â¥â¥, thats it, the voice acting is horrid, the gun play if you can call it that is like having a stroke seizure thing while in a whirl pool shooting a gun with a broken arm. Awful. Dino AI loves to run into rocks, and they can't understand that if your on the rock that means they can't get you.  Also, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the god damn flying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awful trash. â¥â¥â¥â¥ em.
1649	0	a	This game has a super-interesting high concept to it. However, without any defined goal, it's ultimately pointless. There is no end-game. Have fun playing forever, or, more likely, stop after an hour or so and never pick it up again. This is Jason Rohrer at his Rohreriest.
5278	1	a	-buy game for $0.74 or something -why not seems cool -install game -try to play solo -i have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what how  -get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed -okay why not try to just find an open server -join game with 4 others -everyone has vehicles and obviously knows what they're doing -get kicked within 30 seconds -loading screen tip says  -'if you come across a new player, help them out' -ggwp  from what i've seen of it though, it looks cool with a nice concept. i'll try to play more of it so i don't get shamed again.  try again later/10
1989	1	a	very enjoy game appreciate 1010
3466	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.
5258	0	a	This game is trash but the graphics
1650	1	a	Interesting concept where you dive inner(or outer) from yourself, an enemy or power up in order to make the subject in question weaker, stronger or different in order to get to the 'next level'.  Once you figure out the concept of the game... well, that's pretty much it. There is no story so going through each 'level' is pretty much like playing in an arcade, where you are just going for the points. That's not a bad thing, but for me, I wish there was more.  I still recommend the game due to the fact that it has a VERY unique gameplay system. If anything, this game is still worth the trip, even if it is just for a little while!
1831	1	a	Was worth my 19c even if I only played it for like 12 minutes, but yeh its a preety nice game with intense music playing in the backround that just makes ur armpits cry smelly tears.
5687	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the unnistall button.
1512	0	a	Uh oh, poo my pants, Warp is from EA and indie?!? Hmmm!  The floppy sloppy design and buggy wuggy mess you often run into mid-game definitely brings that indie feel across. Warp's a cool idea with the most mixed of executions, but it's mostly good. It's never terribly fun, but it's not like it's boring or anything, either. It just kinda floats around in the vacant, drooly department that leaves you staring at the screen until you finally reach the game's ending. There's no worthwhile story in Warp, so the bulk of the game should rely on level design when we're talkin' stealth and platforming, but, unfortunately for Warp, the level design remains middling, and difficulty pops up and down unpredictably.  On that note...not shabby! ;)
78	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
422	1	a	This is an immensely fun game that successfully blends frantic action with the need to pay attention to your environment and to plan ahead. It'sgood for hours of fun - pick it up as soon as you can!
5511	0	a	wtf y u uninstal bish
5601	0	a	.
4550	1	a	This game is wierd. Dinosaur nazi zombies, except without the nazis or zombies. I have a mixed view about this game. It is well animated and the graphics are great. The weapons work well and fighting huge dinosaurs in a round system could not have been done better. I feel this game isn't deep enough, even though you pay to play, you have to pay to customize, which might not be so bad. Also I think it would have made a good freeroam game. Not survival. But for what you pay for, I suppose its all right.
1622	1	a	a cute platform game where you collect sugar cubes  there is no need to think in this game but the level design and the customize(you can get new skins tecaps and more if you collect a hidden object in each level) makes you want to keep playing :) the music and the colors are relaxing- 7/10
5885	1	a	Fun and cheap.
5149	1	a	Best game ever. Graphics and Gameplay: A++++ Sound: A++++ I love this game and i put more hours with this game than CSGO. 10/10
2337	1	a	team duel - the most fun i've ever had gaming - 5v5 using only lightsabers, bows, temperary stealth and super jumps... need i say more... no, no i don't.
1938	0	a	If you need welfare and life threatening debt play this game 4/10
894	1	a	Remember, you are the hero, but they see you as the final boss of a dungeon crawl. Its you, and your traps. Against hundreds or orcs. Now, if it was thousands, Then maybe, just maybe, it would be a fair fight.
5470	0	a	Bought it for 39 cents. Tried out refund policy. Got 39 cents back. No fireworks i didnt like it much :/ But what to expect from such cheap game + when i saw microtransactions it lost all of its chances.
580	1	a	There are sooo many ways you can complete the levels, I'm almost done finishing the game on hardest difficulty. Its lots of fun and i recommend it to everyone who likes a challenge but doesn't want days and days of content before finishing the game.
3367	1	a	Glitch Simulator 2014 is an awesome game.  The overall experience is better than War Z. I give this game 9/10 because i couldnt find any dinosaurs! If the devs would add this, it would be Game of the year, all year.  Buy it, and give the devs extra monies via paypal!
1421	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
6411	1	a	I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, but I think shooting dinosaurs is part of it. And shooting dinosaurs shouldn't be this much fun for a dollar.  PS: don't attack a t-rex with a lightsaber
759	1	a	DEff one of the best indie games ive played this year!!!
3124	1	a	Where to begin with this game. Dinosaurs, guns, mechs and explosions. What is better than that absoluetly nothing.
1161	1	a	If you can pick this up cheap, its worth a weekend of fun. 3rd person shooter with Tower Defense style gameplay. Set traps and use them to stop the horde from comming through.
1942	0	a	easy to bored..
2512	1	a	First game, I just jumped in. Found a rifle, 'Ooh, that's cool. I'mma shoot me a raptor!'. I ran around until I saw a raptor. As I was patiently scoping on him, a t-rex came up behind me and chomped my â¥â¥â¥. My girlish scream of terror woke up the whole house and I was sold in an instant.  Get this game, shoot dinosaurs, squeal like a little girl and hopefully don't get eaten.  Pure and simple extinct-animal-murdering fun!
1734	1	a	It's no secret by now that indie games are rarelly worth booting or installing, let alone pay for.   This is one of the exceptions. It is a charming, well conceived game made by people who cared what they were doing. This alone gets my thumbs up.    I recomend it for young players especially.
2875	1	a	Guys this is a great laugh........ give it a try!
1375	1	a	I love this game, just to play casual between things. Or you can really competetive with friends in co-op or by comparing campaign scores.
5074	1	a	  Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ that hurt to play.
1642	0	a	Bought this game in 2012 to make one of my friends jealous because they couldn't buy it.   I regret everything.
4487	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible, even worse than Dino Horde
785	1	a	I took a chance buying this game and i'm glad i did, It's fun and addictive, The beauty of this game is that theres no specific way to set up the traps, Set them up your way, The joy of watching your perfectly arranged traps mowing down hordes of Orcs like a well oiled machine is wonderful to behold, With good graphics, sound and humor, I totally recommend this game, you'll almost feel sorry for the Orcs, Almost.
3306	1	a	Before the update of March 1st, this was a fairly average game with a few flaws. I found it fun to shoot dino hores with friends, and would find the whole experiene to be banterous. However with the update it has just revolutionsied the game and made it so much better. I would honestly recommend everyone with friends to buy it, (but if you dont then dont bother). 10/10, would recommend to a friend.
1111	1	a	I loved this game. Just loved it, can't wait to play the sequal.
5948	1	a	Orion is a neat little game, that tries it hardest to be something that's it not. It's a strange mix of cyber and military machinery competing against prehistoric dinosaurs for control over large geological locations. Whether or not the dinosaurs or humans know they're fighting for it, you still are.  There are enough weapons and gadgets to keep you occupied for a while as you figure out which ones you like the most, but I wouldn't invest too much time into it. If you're not playing on hard difficulty, it doesn't really matter, and most strategies are taken on rambo style. Body modidications increase health, increase firing rates, jump heights and more. I've seen the deathmatch in the game, but the lack of players leaves it hard to fight for any top player space.  It's not really good, but not really bad either. I like it, but not that much. There are lots of qualities that come up and can be taken advantage of to make your game even more fun, but there's nothing entirely worth mentioning. For the price, you should get it for sure. If you played it for a day, you'd be getting your money's worth ten fold.. but again, not much more than a day.  Definetly buy it and add it to your collection of games. At the time of writing this, it's one dollar. Can't complain.
1272	1	a	I really love this game.First hours in and I am in love with the game.The graphics are just okay-ish. The campaign has a decent story, overall this game is almost worth your money.
4213	1	a	Honestly the best 50 cent game I think exists. Literally paid for itself from all the laughter and fun between my friends and I.   9/10, worth it.
1386	1	a	Just as fun, if not more so, than the first game.
4429	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. It got bad scores for coming out incomplete but has been updated a ton soon after. It's a good coop survival game to play with some friends.
5676	0	a	As the game stands, it's not half bad for a $1 game, a lot better than most $1 games on the google play store. However this is not the google play store. In fact, i've seen better games on google play that are free. I honestly would recomend this is you're really bored and have $1 to blow on a semi-ok game. However the dev team, or whatever portion of them that wheren't fired so they wouldn't have to be paid for their work, have blatently stolen assets from other games. Honestly i hope the development team tries to drag out any possible future lawsuit between them and Activision so they go bankrupt from the legal fees and loose the hypotetical case
3054	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. Its only .49 cents, just buy it and have fun for a couple of hours.
4003	1	a	The Metacritic is misleading , the game got completly remade after the bad critics wave they eaten up with courage and now the game is combination beetween halo and a survival game with dino ! Simply awsome , the coop aspect is essential to keep being alive. 7/10 With more updates it will become epic , oh yeah and there an open world gamemode.
4777	1	a	Be the only dude with guns to kill dinosaurs  They realize how good I am  Everybody in the server team up on me 1434/10 would play again
6125	1	a	This is a game that I recomend greatly due to its great gameplay. it may have some glitches here and there but its nice to get a game that anyone can get for just a dollar.
5709	0	a	thieving dev
1123	1	a	Great game that offers a lot of fun for a price you wouldn't expect it!  ... and killing Orcs never gets boring!
6206	1	a	Definitely worth .99 cents, really fun and action packed, they are STILL working out the bugs, but that aside it is really fun online game. The dinosaurs vary in size and difficulty, along with bonus beasts to slay.
3105	1	a	This offers a wide variety of dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus, Raptors, T-rex, Triceratops and many more for you to play as or against. Which is neato  Obviously you'll pick and play as the dino master race though, rather than dumb humans.  Overall dino scores: Includation in the game: 10/10 Looks: 7.5/10 Sounds: 3.8/10 Animations: 9/10
3851	1	a	While this game definitely had its rough beginnings, Spiral has really kept moving forward to make a great game. Yeah there are bugs and problems here and there, but you can be sure that Spiral is trying their best to fix as much as they can. With that said, the game has a great concept to it and is fun to play so always try to take problems with a grain of salt. Like others have said already, metacritic ratings aren't accurate as the game has evolved immensely since its origin as Beatdown. If you purchase during the sale, it's a steal for 99 cents since you get so much more than a dollar's worth. So put in that one dollar and help Spiral out, who knows? You might find the game just as fun as any other game out there on steam.  A great game with hard working devs, definitely worth your money and fun to play solo or alone. 9/10
1979	1	a	I mean it kind of looks like a 20 cent budget game, but it's pretty fun. Good level design, relaxed soundtrack, charming artstyle, and a lot of content, even for full price. The physics can get a bit wonky, especially when you're on top of objects, and the lack of any video options at all are baffling, but I'd say give it a go.  On the other hand, Bad Rats is on sale right now, so spend your quarters wisely.
39	0	a	Hard to tell the difference between clubs and spades especially. Sometimes I make the wrong diamonds and hearts also. Fix this, please.
5894	0	a	It's so glitchy and unoptimized. I wouldn't bother purchasing it.
6017	0	a	I was told by a friend that this game isn't that good and I didn't believe him. Till I played it on my own and it isn't that good at all. The gameplay just doesn't seem right, the first thing the enemies do is jusr charge at you no matter what. Even though they're dinosaurs. It doesn't seem to have a good plot to except to protect certain stuff and kill dinosaurs. The graphics are fine, but it doesn't make up for how I think of the game. I don't recommend this game. 5/10
1625	0	a	1 minute in and I realized immediately that the song repeats itself over and over... every stage, the whole time, in a loop of 5-7 seconds... unending. It's so horrible that I couldn't play the game for more than 5 minutes. This is a major failure in the creators part making this game as definitely NOT my cup of tea.
1817	1	a	Surprisingly fun little game.
1635	1	a	The Everest of the PC gaming world. Nothing can compare to the masterpiece that this game is, its perfection restored my faith in God.  
3231	0	a	With so many back of the box mechanics, how on earth could I possibly not recommend this game? Dinosaurs! Jetpacks! Mechs! Character progression! What more could you want?  Well, as it turns out, quite a bit.  From my mere hour impression of the game (and it might come alive later, I wouldn't know) the game feels like an absolute mess. Sure, they've crammed a ton of stuff into here. But I couldn't make out a *game* anywhere. It's hard to explain, but I just couldn't get a sense of what I was supposed to do, let alone why. I couldn't get any traction in this game, I coulnd't make any sense of it. Shooting, movement, everything feels loose and just *meh*. so there weren't any moments that felt satisfying.  I can't even try to comment on visuals, ripped off mechanics, or anything like that. I was just too frickin bored to even bother with anything beyond these meager first impressions.   If you can get it on sale, you're sure to get your money's worth. But if you buying games to actually play them and not just for the sake of buying them, at least wait for another free weekend so you can try before you buy.
1086	1	a	Very fun take on the castle defense genre. Fans of Dungeon Defender will likely find this to be a must-play.
5607	0	a	Metacritic is right at this point! Crappy game.
5938	0	a	this game's â¥â¥â¥â¥
6216	1	a	Pretty damn cool if you have a bunch of pals to play it with.
341	1	a	Orcs. They must die. DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!!
970	1	a	Great game. Makes a whole new meaning to tower defense.
3199	1	a	Best game ever! 10/10 Worth the money, got a dragon fly and flew it to mars.
2042	1	a	This is the best casual game that I've played in a long time. It includes elements of puzzle, platoformer, and shooter that combine together into an excellent game. 10/10  (I'm surprised that I got it for 19 cents)
709	1	a	Tower defense meets 3rd person shooters. Most excellent, highly recommend it.
6345	1	a	This game is still rough around the edges... but for a dollar I am so impressed. I am surprised how much stuff there is in this game.
1494	0	a	i dislike this game, bad graphic quality
3414	1	a	This game doesnt even work :) turn off!
6336	1	a	Pew pew pew, i killed a T rex! A must get for hours of fun. Plus its cheap too. 10/10
1442	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
1936	0	a	I got this game for 50 cents. Theres no way in hell this game is worth 15 bucks
473	1	a	A very entertaining tower defense game with a lot of action and a little bit of humor.
514	1	a	You dont always find a mix gendered tower defense so well done.
5875	1	a	This version is just awesome, enough talking, I need to play more...
1661	0	a	This game has literally no point. No plot. Just the mechanic of shrinking into objects, with no real end to how small you can possibly get. And while that in itself is an awesome mechanic... it is rendered meaningless because there's just no plot. There's nothin'. It's literally just you going around shooting stuff and getting smaller.
5754	1	a	Been a fun game to play from the start, should try it too it is only 0,99 cents..
939	1	a	this feels like a Disney cartoon gone horribly wrong. which is a good thing. probably the most fun I had with an action game all year.
1564	1	a	Fun little strategy time-waster. Turn your brain off (with still a bit of a challenge) and fight off waves of enemies in a static 2D map. Waves go on a little too long imho, but its still fun.  Easily worth a couple of bucks
2264	1	a	love the game, wish i could delete all my progress so i could experience the thrill again from leveling up and getting stronger doing so.
3574	0	a	i wasted 0.99$ in that ....
884	1	a	This is by far one of the most entertaining mindless games I've played for a very long time. I feel like a warning to new players is in order, your fingers will hurt if you mash the attack button to much. Once you got a general feel for the game and only aimed at their heads the game was much more bareable.  Mainly comedy and random orc genocide all in one game.
258	1	a	Really fun single player game, you should check it out if you get the chance. Very addictive, and the constant mayhem and slaughter makes it a game I couldn't put down until I beat it.
5266	0	a	broken, and unfinished feeling, i really dont reccommend this game
5141	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this dev
702	1	a	Tower defense game for people who hate tower defense games.   I hate tower defense games.
1773	1	a	A fun and light platformer, with puzzle mixed inside.  Yes this one good enough to be played.  What's more? it also have trading cards. Features : -Ability to shoot enemy -Ablity to elevate thing with magnetic power -Ability to jump and fly (unlocked later in-game after few stages)   7.5/10
5874	1	a	79 pence, it's actually a good game!
273	1	a	I wasn't expecting this to be so outrageously fun. I bought it in a sale and was not disappointed at all.  Very fun!
4969	1	a	Amazing. Halo and TF2 mashed up with dinosaures and bathed in the madness of borderlands. Cheap houres of riduculousness .
4126	1	a	I was triggered by the unrelistic dinosaur physics simulations. But it does have jetpacks.  5/10 Heavily somewhat kindof recommended.
3505	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
4147	0	a	It says that I own this game so I am reviewing it. It is not a good game. I have not played the game, but I have read what people are saying about the game. They don't like it. Plus, how good can a game be if it was released for $15 but now is routinely sold for $1?  I also think that the developers may hate dinosaurs. Don't support saurian prejudice.
5925	0	a	Only play this if you have a good computer. Please look at minumim requirements for your computer and if you can run it. It was so laggy for me.
3798	0	a	I love how in the trailer the give us a bunch of random people who 'Like' the game and say it's 'Amazing' it's 99c for a reason. For you to think your getting a deal. If it goes for free for the weekend get it though, if you need to pass the time.
3039	1	a	Dont believe the meta score for a second. While this game lacks modern texutre graphics, it hugely makes up for it with gameplay. With regular updates, new features, and devs who actually care what the players think, this game is awesome. even at that its a TON of fun.
5476	0	a	this game isn't fun at all 3/10
4985	1	a	it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
4184	0	a	Wish steam refunds existed when I paid 14.99$ for this pile of garbage. Might be worth it at 99 cents but not at what I paid. I'd say the only real selling point of this game is that it has dinosaurs.
786	1	a	Fun game, average graphics; from me 7/10.
2277	1	a	This game is ridiculous. But it's worth a shot, if you play with your friends. For only a buck it's a decent experience. There's something about this game that gets people playing it, I guess, it's the mindless run-shoot-upgrade model. This game has its fun, but you have to give it a time. I enjoyed this shooter much more than L4D2 for instance. Also, it has one of the most easiest-to-acquire achievement system, I have encountered on Steam. My overall rating â 6/10, because, after all, this game is shallow and with lots of bugs.
1354	1	a	I liked the first one more but that's probably because this one is really anal about using a 360 controller.
5205	1	a	THis is one the worst FPS I have ever seen 
3418	1	a	A bad clone of killing floor mixed with a bad clone of unreal tournament mixed with a bad clone of jedi academy. What's not to love?
4136	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
4886	1	a	This game truley cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. One moment it was Orion: Dino Horde. Now it's Prelude It once cost Â£1.35, then it was free for a while, not it costs Â£0.79. Once it had a leveling system instead of a ingame real-money store.  Overall this is only good if played with friends.
6052	1	a	Don't let the Metascore fool you. This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. Have you ever played a zombies base-defense type game but wanted dinosaurs instead of zombies? Look no further. The graphics are good-looking and easy to run, and you get to shoot dinos. And play as them. Just get it already.
1098	1	a	good and fun game. * * * *
1091	1	a	Funny game Must buy on sale
6409	1	a	This game is....actually damn good. All it needed was a good playerbase to go along with these updates and boom, really fun. I suffered from a couple frame drops but perhaps I need to adjust some more settings. Aside from that, really fun game with friends/strangers.  8/10
5068	1	a	Surpringly fun. The menu is absolute balls and horrible, but the actual gameplay is fun. Be warned the game is very sensitive to ping. Anything over 100 starts getting a little annoying.
1793	1	a	Its actually a pretty good platformer.
4905	0	a	Frame are complete â¥â¥â¥, and it's not because of my PC. Worst optimized game of all time, uninstalled
3340	1	a	Worst game? think again. This game is probably the best game I ever played: It is totally worth it for the price, it's a lot of fun with your friends and it has more gamemodes than any game out there (and good ones, like gungame, the usual survival and 1v1). The game is perfect, I mean, I played counter-strike for a long time and I thought it was like really good and the same happened to skyrim, but this one is different, in this game you are gonna have twice as much fun as you would on any coop game or even not coop games, you are gonna have way more fun in this game than in games like killing floor or portal (those games are pretty good as well tho). What I am saying is 'buy it, and buy it fast' cuz it's probably the best game you'll ever play in your entire life.
378	0	a	ERROR:Failed to load 'shaders\FixedFunctionShaders.ShaderLib' Engine will not run.
4060	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
962	1	a	It's very well-made, and fun to play. The traps are pretty interesting and varied, although some are kinda useless.
1552	1	a	Short but really fun game!
784	1	a	ONE HELL OF A GAME,  you are missing out if you donât get this game, with varied levels, weapons/traps and enemies all combined into this small but brilliant game.  itâs a game you can just relax to, set traps and watch your enemies die or get stuck in killing as many Orcs as you can.  Well worth the buy even at full price.
1530	1	a	Warp is a different way of thinking but I loved the challenge and the game play.
5710	1	a	starsiege tribes with dinosaurs  really loads of fun to play  game looks, sounds, plays and runs great  so ignore the metascore / bad press / negative reviews and check it out, at just $1 is a steal!
3264	1	a	It's a gud game, only $1 pretty cheap m8.  360 no scopin' dinos like no tomorrow.  9/10
1338	1	a	This game has it all, its one of them arcade games but with a great story to it. Shank 2 reminds me of 'Commando' which was on miniclip and Shank 2 made it like that, but on steroids. The art is great the becuase it is like a comic feature. The combo system and the combat brilliant, Everything is great. The best Â£3 ive spent, its been a while since ive played a fast pace action video game and this is one i'd reccomend to people. :)
1781	1	a	BEEP is a very good game. Set in a new system, somewhere far away, in a 2D land, there are BEEP ships, they have BEEP's on them. The ships create the BEEP's and you control the BEEP's, trying to get all of the matter in each level, to unlock more levels. Pros- Good puzzle game Good controls Easy to play Easy access and start menu Cons- 2D Unrealistic Some puzzles are too hard too solve Glitching... The game is an okay, 2D exploration puzzle game- I give it 8.5/10
2543	1	a	For $1 this game is awesome. Gunplay is alright, the auto-shotgun is satisfying, the vehicle combat is fun as hell. My only problem with the game is the vehicle spawning but overall for the price the game is amazing.
63	1	a	One of the things I like about indie games is that they try out unique concepts that more mainstream developers would either never think of or be too scared to try. Runespell: Overture is a Norse themed RPG but is set apart from other RPGs by its unique battle system. You and your oppenent are given a deck of playing cards laid out solitaire-style and the idea is to build poker hands using the face up cards of you and your opponent. The better the hand, the harder it hits! Attacking and taking hits also builds up your rage meter which is used for activating spell cards similar those found in collectible card games to further give you an edge. Over the course of the game you will meet new allies, complete new quests, find new cards and further the story. If the idea of an RPG with poker-style battling and CCG elements appeals to you, get this game! You won't regret it.
5452	0	a	This game just downright sucks. For someone who likes to play dinosaur games this one isn't even trying just another survive the wave game nothing special. Just buy primal carnage extincion you get more worth outta your moneys then this game. But why do i hate this game? It's not even something only just a game with ''skins'' ''classes'' and ''different'' dinosaurs same colours, Graphics aren't even being updated. This ''game'' just needs to be stopped.
1457	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
193	1	a	This was my first steam game! And its good.
6043	1	a	Pretty fun for cheap
1638	1	a	Support me and get this game!
2461	1	a	This game is amazing, better than CoD and battlefield combined and the perfect blend of action and ridiculousness! I don't see why this doesn't get more publicity 
3116	1	a	gameplay - pretty solid, and a lot of fun with friends, and multiplayer. graphics - this game is not meant directly to graphic enthusiasts, but still looks pretty solid  lots of different modes to enjoy with many players.  cons. - many glitches and weird buggy gameplay which get frustrating. overall this game is pretty fun and i would give it a legit rating of 7.5/10
1151	1	a	If killing orcs is wrong I don't want to be right.
6461	1	a	Clearly it's great i can tell by the trailer the last time i played it was laggy and sucked now it seems like a complete awesome game.
2980	1	a	Don't listen to the metascore. This game has vastly improved.
727	1	a	What do you need to know that the title doesn't tell you?  This is a great introduction into what is quickly becoming one of my favorite series of games.
1183	1	a	Who wants to have fun killing orcs? Everyone, that's who. Few things are more satisfying that setting up deadly traps and watching orcs be violently ripped apart, sliced and crushed with wonderful cartoony blood and guts splattering everywhere. And who doesn't love cartoon gore? No one, that's who. I'm not really into the tower defense genre myself, but this game is not one to pass up. Fast paced action and dasterdly traps await you. It's also the first game that allowed me the pleasure of hearing a ten year old girl cackle madly after filling her spellbook with nasty traps and proclaim, 'It's so easy to be evil!'  Yes it is, small female human. Yes it is.
3321	1	a	a t-rex ate me and i turned into a playmobil while my teammates were trying to run over a triceratops with a bike  game of the year every year
564	1	a	awesome tower defence based game.
6174	1	a	for 99 cents you really can't beat this game. Yes it might not have singleplayer or any sembelance of a storyline, but it does not detract from what the game is about. A 4 player shoot dinosaurs in the face simulator. Add that to the fact to multuiple game modes (one of wich you play the dinos on a quest to eat some supersoldiers) and you got a recipe for a very fun multiplayer experience. Updates are frequent and always seem to add to this game. A must buy in my book.
4253	0	a	LITERALLY the worst game I've EVER played.
5882	1	a	might just be the best fun I ever had for 60p and workshop too .. also it plays great on a pad for chilling back on the couch . Never been a big fan of survival fps but this game alone is changing that :)
766	1	a	Great game for easy fun in first levels, challenging in later ones. Great action-strategy with absurd humor... What more can you ask for?
3125	1	a	For a dollar its a must buy. I would suggest getting a copy for a friend as this game should is quite fun when you are playing with friends.   Pros ----------- -Lots of weapons -Vehicles -Dinos (what more can I say) ----------- Cons ----------- -Animations are derpy -Graphics are meh -Some maps are retextured and passed off for new one -Glitchy dinos (sometimes) ---------- This is your typical wave surival game. Kill enemies get credits spend them for weapons/upgrades. Die. For a dollar its worth the laughs  7/10
275	1	a	Crazy fun action tower defense style game, you'l be hooked within one level. Funny and enjoyable.  It's a healthy blend of Shooter with Tower Defense, allowing you to build traps on the walls, ceilings, and floors to create unique kill zones. But also letting you equip spells and weapons to fight off the Orcs that way if you'd like.
4860	1	a	i have never seen a company care so much about there players. they pump out updates every almost every month and there completely free. This game also has some of the best co-op of any game i have played. Keep up the good work guys!
5537	0	a	Bad game its a REALLY BAD GAME! they say theyve changed it but its the same old glitchy mess it was 3 years ago! evan without the glitches its a boring game!
5910	1	a	It is really fun. I don't see why everybody is rating it badly, it never crashes and is really fun to play. totally buy it.
1337	1	a	Only played the 1st level so far, it was FREE for the weekend, and I flipping LOVED it.
1336	1	a	Very fun game with an intuitive and simple gameplay. If you like the genre of 2D kill 'em all you'll definately will like Shank 2.
6279	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ its bad
419	1	a	Unique game. Totally worth the money and will suck you in.
1969	1	a	This is not a word I use to describe games much, if at all, but the game is very cute. The robot known as a beep, is very much like a WALL-E, and makes appropriate 'cute' sounds. I actually crack up quite a bit from the sounds it makes, and the art style and music also follows along with the theme.  The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the platforming is very forgiving. The jumps are very floatly, with a very generous gliding back down to the ground. Combine that with the anti-gravity gun, and you have some good control over the robot. He even goes up surfaces with it's wheels that you wouldn't think he could climb up.  I would say content wise, the game is safe for children, however some puzzles might cause the child to want some adult help. Even still, I think the game is friendly to people of all ages, and I highly recommend the game. I was thinking this was a game I'd only farm trading cards out of, given the extremely low price. Instead, I found a game I intend to play through, and enjoy very much.  A surprise, and an enjoyable one at that.
1606	1	a	Tower Defense, thats literally this game. Nothing more. So if you're not into it, don't bother. It's an iOS port, it's a simple game with simple controls. It's both good and bad in that aspect, it gets to the point where you just place your turrets and want to walk away, or alt tab (but that game pauses when you do). The music gets annoying after awhile, although i play with really low music anyways I could see that being an issue for many.   Biggest problems I have with the game, even though you have different maps and 2 campaigns (Allies and Axis), the maps look different but its just the same each time. The campaign gives you a few missions at a time, kinda cool the way it does it on the gui. Quickplay is stupid unless you're going for achievements, it's litterally the campaign missions, except you have to beat that map in campaign just to play it in quick play.   The fast foward button feels like a 20% increase in speed, espeically when dealing with slower units coming at you.  5/10 This game is realy only casual at best worth getting on sale for cheap
5092	1	a	Astonishing gameplay - Extreme fun and proves a challenge.
4139	1	a	With this new update i am shocked with what i am playing. doesnt even feel like dino horde, it feels like a brand new game and i fell in love with it all over again. i liked it b4 and now i like it even more. great game to play with friend :D
999	1	a	Humorous, entertaining and great replayability. A must have for the sequal to unlock the classic levels. (9/10)
1605	1	a	Kinda fun shooting and destroying stuff XD. Great game
689	1	a	WAY fun and very addicting!
3611	1	a	  well i played for the first time now after 1 year, and its a lot more buggy than before, it has a cheap price, but i find it frustrating and almost unplayable now.
880	1	a	Really great Game! Its ratehr addicting and loads of fun. Sadly this one is only single player but OMD2 is multiplayer so i would suggest getting that 1 to play with friends, but this is still an awesome game totally worth 10$. You'll get your moneys worth if you like Tower Defense games with a 3rd person shooter/melee/magic twist.
284	1	a	This game is an absolute riot and blast to play. No MP support, but the SP game is a ton of fun and some of it is extremely challenging.
867	1	a	funny story lines and hillraious character.
2594	1	a	Don't even have the game but i can review it.  11/10
3563	1	a	Good Shooter game! Nice graphic!
2397	1	a	Incredibly fun game to play with friends!  A survival game that pits the future against the past.  I highly recommend all players pick up a copy of this game, especially for it's unbeatable price!
5354	1	a	Have endless fun fighting dinosaurs in ORION: prelude. 3 main classes with lots of variations, woth the buy.
3200	1	a	This game really isn't that bad anyway, so the fact that it is Â£0.79 ($0.99) is phenominal, there's litterally no reason for you and friends not to get this game, being as cheap as it is. Shooting dinosaurs is nice, the easter egg events are great and it really tests you and your friends when you first play.  After not long the game becomes rather easy and you gain more knowledge; make sure to turn the difficulty up.  And not to mention you can 720 blaze a T-Rex with a sniper rifle :D
35	1	a	+Interesting gameplay (same combos as Poker, played more like Solitaire but where you can steal cards from opponent) +Nice music (though gets repetitive by end of campaign) +Easy to learn rules, quick but adequate tutorial +Great interface -Mainly good for one playthrough (approx 10 hours depending on skill) -First Turn Advantage factor is significant -Role-playing/Story is secondary to the card gameplay. (all conversations can be skipped safely)  ?Game will supposedly get free update putting multiplayer in the game (hotseat first). No paid DLC.
4025	1	a	Very Good Game heavily suggest it... however get you connection ready for the amazing dino chaos; they swarmp you litrely it's... SOOO COOL!!! 9/10 (could improve on the paid customizations make a in-game monet system for to look awsome without spend too much money *not complaining on the prises*)
823	1	a	Lots of traps, even more orcs, rifts, egocentric and big-headed apprentice. Funny taunts and dialogues in the midst of flying spare body orc parts everywhere. Yes, that's this game. Silly thing it is =]
2820	1	a	Game of the year! 10/10 It bearly works. amazing to record!! It's awesome butt ses so it doesn't work so good.
3291	1	a	This game has more content than some milky milkers,but hei its fraking Hilarious and lovely,much better then some big blockbusters!
5070	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
2849	1	a	Just like battlefield with dinosaurs. 'It's okay 11/10' - IGN
2838	1	a	This game is great, i picked it up for the $0.99 sale. It is a fun game, it does need server work and i think there should be a TDM type mode as to where 2 teams battle it out, but also have to watch for dino's.  the graphic system does need an upgrade, it is a great looking game but it can be better, the menu needs an overhaul as well, the store items and character loadout is really pixeled and not clear.  The game has potential, and i see that there is another update coming this year, for a change of it to be orion: prelude with new maps, characters, menu, game modes ect. i hope graphics and dedicated servers are in it as well. Maybe more players in each game as well. But while this game is on sale id reccomend it, you cannot go wrong for $0.99
1103	1	a	Seriously the BEST TOWER DEFENCE game out there. A whole lot of fun.
5799	1	a	very pretty, very flashy, very fun with freinds. it's as if halo classic was remade with dinosars. the animations are meh, and the previous versions were a mess, but i think this one is juuust right
5991	0	a	terrible, not even worth 1.99 or whatever it is
4235	0	a	A â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor game with laughably bad mechanics, a lot of bugs, guns that feel like a weak ejaculation and ugly looking graphics. Not even worth it if it were free.
2251	1	a	It's hard being a support class. Everytime there's a support class, you are expected to heal/support team mates while saving your own skin. If your team mate dies 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT' , if you die 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT', if your whole team dies 'WHERE THE HELL IS THE SUPPORT?'. RIP support class for being too supportive :(
5469	1	a	An excellent game that you'll soon forget!
4373	0	a	I just don't like the game, my personal opinion.
3042	1	a	For $0.50 this is the best investment of 50 cents you could ever have. I would gladly pay 10.00 for this beauty of a game. Lots of replayabilitiy, good for wasting time with friends.  I love it.
52	1	a	This game is fairly terrible, but I can't stop playing.
4391	0	a	Clunky and unattractive menu just generally something you'd make on scratch its just ehh 
2954	1	a	I've never been much of a fan of Shooters, but this game keeps bringing me back for more. Have you ever played a game where you can shoot dinos with a powerful array of weapons, or been able to kill a T-Rex by punching it in the face? Well, despite Sally more likely to end up eating you whole, this game has that, and so much more. It may lack the story that Guardians of Orion has, but nothing's as good at relieving tension than running through Prehistoric mode solo, as you can set enemy damage, health, large and small dinosaur ratios, starting credits, and credit drop rate to become a dinosaur killing machine, easily going on a 6 hour spree without even realizing how much time has passed. For just a dollar you can get so much fun out of this gem of a game, so I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a chance.
3159	1	a	bought a 4-pack for $0.99 and i've played alot more than i expected. it does need work but overall a fun game.
905	1	a	Know about tower defense games? Know about fantasy creatures? Know about humour? Know about shooters? You'll see all of them combined in this amazing action-strategy game by Robot Entertainment.  The main objective is that all orcs must die. But in order to complete that objective, you'll need to place traps and learn spells and forge weapons and train an army and... use your head. And your muscles. Because there are many ways to finish a level. If an orc or one of their allies (kobolds, ogres, goblins) lives long enough to reach the rift you're bound to protect, then it's over. Remeber: you're a War Mage, and War Mages need to protect the rifts at all cost.  You can use the environment, hire troops, place traps, engage them with your weapons, do as you please, as long as you get to carry your objective.  Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die!  
1118	1	a	Strategy and killing orcs, what more can you ask for?
5958	1	a	Awesome Game. Just buy and enjoy it.
4165	0	a	This game is ok it has a few bugs and it is just dead its fun to play with friends but if you want to play online, theres just no point.   I woud rate it 5/10
83	0	a	it's like solitaire with someone punching you in the face every few minutes and then slapping your cards off the table
1958	0	a	The worst game ever played. Can't do anything. Gliches everywhere. Highly not recommended
2080	1	a	Perfectly Simulates Jurassic Park If It Was In Russia.
3975	0	a	NO, this game sucks, look at the old players from 1 year ago have to pay 6euro, now just 1 dollar, just not worth it, this game's developer should do something about it, because just changing the price over night ain't change the fact 1 year ago it was 10 euro!  Edit and add: the game became positive for some reason let me see what people see in the pros?  Pros: Memeing every possible way of killing a t-rex Memeing every possible way of bugging out Memeing every possible way of the potential nazi t-rex invasion  Cons that i see for myself: -Sluggish animation that is even worse than Ride to hell -Guns work like free FPS browser game -Dinosaur bugging the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of u if u are in a vehicle  1st the Aligator will bug out in the water with the rest of the dinosaur if u are in a jeep that face backward to them at the begining of the round 2nd T-rex are sometimes invisible  3rd Flying dinosaurs are the worst thing to kill cause they â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bugging out at the top of the skybox 4th Helicopter is the worst maybe worse in some case as it cant shoot flying dinosaurs without flipping out 5th Tanks will fly  - Map design are too big , making an attempt for (open world) . And there is a mode called open world but it is just a bigger map with some random crate that have the same modes of other maps in various part of it
2051	1	a	Actually a pretty fun game. The gameplay can get repetitive at times, but definitely worth buying (if you wait for a sale that is)
5144	0	a	The developer of this game stole assets from the CoD series!
2780	1	a	Fun with friends, but not that great of a game overall. graphics are old and bad, game is poorly optimized, but the gunplay is fun. Unless you havve a fairly large group of friends with Orion, I do not reccomend.
2147	1	a	Futuristic shooter with Dinosaurs. Lots of Defense game modes that mainly consist of surviving waves of dinosaurs and protecting your base from them. 9\10
6258	1	a	'Good' multiplayer game. Great with friends!
1895	1	a	I'm not sure why this is in the popular new releases. This was the first game I bought on steam...4 years ago.
4906	1	a	Drive around in a jeep with an auto-aiming gun, firing at extinct dinosaurs with high technology.  I'd play more if it wasn't extremely laggy for me. Fun game, though. Cheap, too.  Play it. 
5046	0	a	Buggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Couldn't play as a result. You better off with a free flash game.
5583	0	a	Best black screen simulator of 2016  -10000/10 IGN would die again waiting for zis game to launch
1053	1	a	Orcs Must Die! offers a unique perspective to the tower defense genere. Build your defenses and fight yoru way through swarms of orcs in this 3rd person behind the shoulder tower defense / beat 'em up hybrid game.
4439	1	a	Nice one :)
3517	0	a	6/10
3940	1	a	If I could say one thing about this game...it would be dinosaurs
1954	0	a	Don't buy this. Now, some people will dislike this because I don't explain much, but now will I explain all you have to know.   You. Can. Find. A copy. Of. This. On. Y8 or something similar.
3031	1	a	Very adictive Game
4751	1	a	Great and educational.  Now I know the difference between a Stegosaurus and a Triceratops. Sadly my friends have not yet caught on.
4072	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
5591	0	a	Bought this game back when it was 'Dino Beatdown' and still Early Access. It cost me 20$ at the time and it was so worth it. There were no microtransactions that I could remember, people actually played the game, and it ran better. I'm glad it's one dollar because if it cost any more, it wouldn't be worth it.  Full of microtansactions and bad graphics, it was better 4 years ago.
4676	1	a	dino's and swag 10/10 would jurassic
4247	0	a	This is so bad, not even worth 49 cents.
3658	1	a	kind of simple still good
4694	1	a	cheap and fun
3331	1	a	By buying this game you spend money unnecessarily for Neak crap.  I would recommend this game to people who have a lot of friends, so that they can play (quite good) multiplayer, which  with a bunch of friends definitely enjoy.   Gameplay: 8/10  Graphic design 7/10   The price is a little overshoot.  servers are half-empty.  Even some bug is avoided.
4365	1	a	If It only didnt lag as hell I could write a decent review.
3278	1	a	I reccomend this game simply on the basis that it has guns and dinosaurs without even getting into the fact that it has jetpacks, tanks and lightsabers
3687	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points.
2973	0	a	Well, it sucks.
849	1	a	its the best game on earth
1718	1	a	I liked it. It was a interesting little platformer. Some interesting powerups, and collecting all the antimater pieces.
2765	1	a	I'm not sure why this game received such low reviews. I hear it used to be not the caliber it is, but I just played it for a solid hour and it was a blast. Seriously the most fun I've had in a long time. 8/10, would recommend.
3998	0	a	Terrible Halo ripoff however it's still mildly fun for a couple of hours to play regardless of how bad it is.
506	1	a	Hilariously fun.
2944	1	a	Cheap and pretty fun. It's a win-win.
2972	1	a	This game isn't too bad, and I know I say this with a very low gameplay count, but it isn't THAT bad. I definitely think that this game has improved, although I hadn't played the older versions, hearing it from other players, it seemed to evolve a ton. The developers seem fun, seeing as they called their old game 'the worst game ever', which is always nice to have good developers. I bought the fourpack for my friends, still haven't given all of them away though.  Let's start with the graphics. When I first launched the game, the title screen was okay, and then I joined a game and the graphics seemed a little... strange, not too well done. Then again, I'm used to ARK graphics, which is most likely why. As I went deeper into the game, I ignored the faulty graphics and I think it's still enjoyable.  Onto the gameplay. When I started up the game, I went into a server to see what everything was about. Wow, I never thought I'd be so confused - I went into a random gamemode, chose to play as a Dilo, and had no clue what I was doing. I started spitting everywhere and a human crawled up next to me and blew me up. That was that for that server, so I went into the Survival gamemode with a few other players. Man, that was certainly a plus. The survival gamemode is fun, waves of dinosaurs of all types, and it's decently challenging when you have everyone come after you. It took me about 5 minutes to get the hang of it (which I am a fast learner, sometimes), and all was good. I followed my teammates to see what was going on, shot dinosaurs, killed a pteradon. Overall, the gameplay I've had so far has been decent.  Honestly, this game is good and all, but don't have high hopes. But then again, for $1, the price of a can of coke, this is worth it, definitely. Sure, there may be glitches, the gameplay may be wonky, the dinosaurs kill you every two minutes, but if you manage to look past its faults, Orion: Prelude is a wonderful game. I'd rate it 7/10.
4808	1	a	It's â¬0.99  You can't lose.
4702	1	a	It was okay.  More towards a Halo Theme.
1007	1	a	So much fun! Seriously, no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ jokes, this is an excellent game that might be one of the most fun out there. Unique weapons, characters and it's also pretty funny.
812	1	a	This is a fun two player experience and is rather unique in its approach. I'd call this a good game if you are not expecting more than it has to offer. It is good at what it does offer.
3862	0	a	Bahahahahahahahaha! *weez* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! *cough cough* HAHA! *cough*  HA! *cough cough cough* *gargle* HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *dies*
1010	1	a	This game is very addicting and stessful at times but it is a lot of fun.
5554	0	a	They steal assets and claim they never did it. Great.  Activision may be scums, they clearly got robbed anyway.
4083	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3539	1	a	Bought it at 99 cents and it worth every penny and more! Haven't played it a lot yet but from what I did play it was already worth the 99 cents.
3578	1	a	The finest hour for FPS.
2788	1	a	Dino horde, the game you just love to hate, bad? maybe? its a game that you can play again and again and again, and yet still rage at it no matter how good/bad it is!   Is it worth it? not so much.
3241	1	a	this game awesome! after update for conquest mode and world map this game jump from garbage (3/10) to nearly perfect game (8-9/10) share the games with your friends and survive this primal world!
5697	0	a	'Polished turd' is the best description i can come up with for this game. after playing it for a while, and doing some research, i honestly can't think of anything else. considering how long this game has been in the works, it looks like about three people spent their free weekends on it. it's overall quality is on par with PS1, but with slightly better graphics. if this was a free game on a site like New Grounds, i'd be impressed. after four or five years of 'professional' development, it's just sad.   The 93% discount plus the extended free trial smacks of desperation. or perhaps something more insidious? as though they are hoping you will get hooked, and become one of the rationalizing legion of followers feebley attempting to defend their poor choice.    not to mention all the controversy. but you'll have to look into that yourself.  P.S. I got a one week forum ban for 'If you can't say something nice...'
3889	1	a	Open the door, get on the floor, errybody shoot them dinosaurs. Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but its essentially COD zombies plus Halo's firefight with just a dash of freaking dinosaurs. Have you ever played another game where you got to shoot freaking dinosaurs wit yo homies? NEIN.
12	1	a	This game is not worth the effort it takes to learn how to play. I remember being really excited about it when it first came out, but then I didn't buy it until like a year ago and it's pretty dumb, guys.
4222	0	a	Horrible graphics swallowed lage â¥â¥â¥ cracks
2613	1	a	What you must know is that it's all about the vehicles. Get a ground vehicle, run dinos over or shoot them from and attached gun with someone else driving. Or get an aerial vehicle and shoot the hell out of annoying dumb flying dinos.
3796	0	a	still just as bad as it ever was...
6249	1	a	Surprisingly entertaining for just 1 euro. 5/5 would recommend!
2575	1	a	this game is good for 0.99 i dont see why you wouldnt get it i would probably pay 5.00 for this game 9/10 bugs
1790	1	a	better than csgo &lt;3 only 20cent :)
6375	1	a	This game is so amusing to play. It's fun to take a bow and shoot a T-Rex in the face. I recommend you play it while it's free, and if you don't, because it's too late by the time you read my review, buy it! It's only a dollar. I recommend buying the four pack. It's awesome if you can get a group of friends together and play it!
1594	1	a	This is a game to which I keep returning. It's old but still loads of fun and well-balanced.
509	1	a	This game was the reason I came back to steam after four years of not using it. It's an absolute blast! It's a mix of Tower Defense and First Person Shooter with some good comedy thrown in. It's a must-play for any Tower Defense fans.
206	1	a	It's a trap! Well, quite a few of them actually. And you can upgrade them. Orcs Must Die! puts a proactive spin on the tower defense genre. Different enemy types require tactical thinking and you'll find yourself going back to older levels to try new stregies. Fun!
2312	1	a	hands down the best game you can get for $0.99. tons of game modes and cool guns! perfect for the jurassic world hype!
5816	1	a	9/10 Is not that fps friendly but is plenty of fun
4590	1	a	A game where you run around a huge, picturesque map killing dinosaurs what else do you need
4183	0	a	a whopping 0 playerbase. not even worth a single dollar.   10/10 main menu simulator
5779	1	a	become invisible and stab dinosaurs in the back 10/10
535	1	a	Castle defense for the sole sake of Orc bashing fun. It's entertaining.
5798	1	a	This game got renamed a couple of times:  ORION: Protoype  ORION: Open Source  Orion: Dino Beatdown Orion: Dino Horde Orion: Prelude &lt;-- currently  But you know what they keep updating the game which is good to see from a developer. It doesnt feel like a complete game but then again what game does? It's almost like one of those games it's bad but it's so good. For one dollar its lots of fun. One these games that you have to try for a bit and play it once a week with friends. Its one of those coop games that you can just sit back relax and have fun. It's not a game where you can play hours and hours and scream at people for being bad. Not a competivie game. The game has aspects of Killing Floor and L4D with waves of dinosaurs. If you like those type games you will like this. People are friendly and its even better with friends.  Gave 4 copies to my friends so we can have a break from CSGO from now and then. And did I mention its only $1... like sheeeet.  Graphics: Its from the Unreal Engine 3. So it could be better.  Game Modes : Survial - Defend against wave of dinosaurs Conquest - Muliple Bases to Defend Vital - 5v5 PvP protect your base while destory the enemy base Capture the Flag - Capture the Flag Ramage - PvP Dinos Vs Carriers  Team Elimination - 5v5 PvP Team Duel - 5v5 Swords and Bows Free for All - Deathmatch King of the Hill - Machine Guns and Flamethrowers Gun Game Slaughter - Every 25 kills you are offered new weapon  1v1 Duel  FFA Duel Instagib
3263	1	a	Very fun to play, never gets old.  The amount of effort the Devs have put into this game makes it worth way more than $1.
852	1	a	Fun and simple, with lots of jokes, this game is a MUST buy, this and the sequel!
998	1	a	Crazy fun, totally worth it
855	1	a	They must all die.
4097	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥
2285	1	a	It's like cs go, but with dinosaurs  11/10 - Would play this game again (with friends this game is a must own)
1266	1	a	A solid twin-stick shooter set in a mech/steampunk world. You can upgrade your vehicle's weapons and armor, and even get a cool pet to follow you on your dangerous exploits.

734	1	a	Great Game! Fun to play and easy to learn!
4130	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
1750	1	a	It's like they say,you cant judge a book by it's cover...likewise here
2002	1	a	IT GOOD TO KILL TIME
442	1	a	Does what it says on the tin.
356	1	a	A superb 'Tower Defense' game that will have you coming back for more.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRtNMrV-PY   Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die in this fantasy action-strategy game from Robot Entertainment.   As a powerful War Mage with dozens of deadly weapons, spells, and traps at your fingertips, defend twenty-four fortresses from a rampaging mob of beastly enemies, including ogres, hellbats, and of course, a whole bunch of ugly orcs. Battle your enemies through a story-based campaign across multiple difficulty levels, including brutal Nightmare mode!   Will you roast orcs in pits of lava, pound them flat with a ceiling trap, or freeze and shatter them with a slash? No matter the weapons and traps you choose, youâre sure to have an orc-killing blast! - Highly Recommended! 
2183	0	a	When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.  Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.  The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.  Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped. I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.  On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.
4276	0	a	This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. dont waste a dollar on this thing. This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that i almost choked to death on my own â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hand
1483	1	a	Loved this. The little alien is so easy to control. Good story line too. Still need to finish the game as it does get tougher the more you play. 9/10
889	1	a	This game is ridiculous.
2726	1	a	You can punch dinosaurs in the face
3869	0	a	Someone has found a way to make dinosaurs not awesome.
4644	1	a	Escaped by holding ctrl. 10/10
4224	0	a	This is a very clumsy and bad game. Fuzzy controls, horrible game play and sub-par graphics. Seriously overpriced even at .99 cents. Download the free weekend version for giggles and mourn the disc space and band width wasted. The metacritic score is not a lie. Couldn't stand more than five minutes of this stuff. The dinos do look rather nice even though they move like sorry stop motion animation puppets. Maybe the devs should reprogram this game as a screen saver?
4680	1	a	5/10
3055	1	a	Good game easy to play with friends
5797	1	a	I don't understand why most people hate this game.  -Dinosaurs -Jetpacks -Guns, vehicles, perks -&lt;Â£1 -Oh and did I mention dinosaurs and jetpacks?  WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
824	1	a	Very cool little indie gem right here! :) Got awesome graphics and it's pretty chalenging!! 8/10 for me ;) I definatelly recomend it
807	1	a	I did not expect this to be anywhere near as stupidly fun as it is!
6048	1	a	This game is a fun FirstPerson shooter with a destructive force of dinosaurs. Will you join me in the endless waves of killer monsters?
1906	0	a	5/10 Scotty, beep me out  No matter if it's concept, engine, artwork or gameplay, everything feels like the devs have bitten off more than they could chew. After a complete overhaul (that hopefully doesn't make it stutter and lag on a 2015 PC anymore) it might be worth your money.
556	1	a	It's an enjoyable tower defense game with a good amount of humor. Gameplay is intuitive and fun with unique abilities allowing for creative 'deaths.'
2555	1	a	T-Rex ate me.. EPIC!
5397	0	a	'Can't Run On A Potato' -D00M   I guess it can run on Potatoes, game got stuck when I joined the server and the camera was just stuck on 1 view and I couldn't move.   =========Rip=========  ---60 Cents---   *You'll Be Remembered.*
1802	1	a	Surpisingly fun. It's hard but the neat imagery makes it less of a rage than a platformer like Mario. Plus, it's only $2USD, and it goes on sale fairly often. I'd pick it up. I got it as a random key but I'm glad I did!
1089	1	a	Very fun and entertaining game! I will definitely buy OMD 2!
2254	1	a	I love this game ! :D
5837	1	a	It has dinosaurs Otherwise, really laggy, no story, repetitive. 12/10-dinos
250	1	a	This is the orginal, it is better than the sequel (OMD2).
3999	0	a	This Game is a Dinosaur.
633	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very nice take on the tower defense genre. Seeing as I only played through the Single Player portion of the game and on Warmage difficulty my review will be based on that.  The game starts out with a short cinematic of an old archmage who meets his untimely demise at the hand of some stairs. As he falls Orcs are about to storm the portals into our world with one last obstacle in their way, the archmage his terribly unskilled apprentice, you.  Throughout the campaign the game slowly expands your arsenal of weapons and traps that you can use to slaughter the oncoming horde as they attempt to break through. At no point are you overwhelmed with choice or are you left with few options on how to handle a given situation.  While some strategies are more effective in certain situations you are always free to take the hard path. The difficulty level is not too high in this game and greatly depends on your preffered play style. Once I developed a certain preffered trap combo I found myself using it over and over with great effect until certain maps came along where the combo was entirely useless forcing me to adapt my playstyle.  The only shortcoming in this game is that while the difficulty is okayish in most levels there are certain spikes that can come as a complety suprise and force you to figure out some mechanics without being informed about them so this might be frustrating for some players who prefer to casualy walk through a game.  The only noticeable bugs I encountered were with flying enemies going straight through walls in some stages and in another some enemies managed to get stuck at the bottom of an acid swamp without dying. Overal these encounters were few and once you were aware of the possibility of them occuring not all that problematic.  Overal score of 8/10, Would totally recommend this to fans of the genre.
4744	1	a	It was $0.60 so I bought it, idk.
2799	1	a	Can kill T-Rex with mech.  10/10 Game of the Year  On a more serious note:  This game is incredibly underrated. I've played several hours of the survival mode alone, and it has been some of the most fun I've ever had in video games. The gun's models are well done, but are few in number. The game runs like butter and has crashed only once after a couple hours of gameplay. The dinosaurs models and animations aren't cringe-worthy. The combat is fluid, but some of the mechanics are questionable (Specifically the fight-to-survive mechanic). The graphics aren't anything revolutionary, but don't take away from the experience. The rounds in survival do, however, need a ready-up function to bypass the minute wait time in between waves.  I payed $0.99 for this game and had a better experience with it than I have with most AAA shooters selling for 60 dollars.  8/10, highly recommend.
2679	1	a	Its a nice little game that you can enjoy for a some time. especially with friends and stuff. it is a bit bad here and there but overall its a pretty good experience.
6119	0	a	This game can be, 'fun' but it really isnt that great. The graphics arent what they were portrayed to be and most everything else is just terrible quailty, do not reccomend.
3048	1	a	To be honest it's a crap game. But it was 99c!
3959	0	a	I tried playing this game, but not even the slightest indication of how to play or what you are doing is given. 0 out of 5 stars.
172	1	a	Some games you can tell are going to be good from the first 10 minutes of playing them. Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone.   But presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.  At the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.  Overall the game was loads of fun. I've had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it's often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it's a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.
3926	1	a	Dino defense with more options :)
2668	1	a	After the update and switch to UDK this game got AMAZING. My whole class in college is full of people who play it and LOVE it. I cant remember a time in my life I have had this much fun outside the tub. I give it 5.4 stars out of 6.
368	0	a	I emailed Robot Entertainment to report a bug in the game because some creatures didn't die when they landed in lava. They simply said to buy the sequel because they didn't want to release any more bug fixes. Avoid like the plague.
36	1	a	its good cuz therse cards an teyy fight guys
253	1	a	Pretty fun fps/tower defense game.
6164	1	a	THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME
3032	1	a	I purchased a 4 pack of this game while it was on sale, not expecting much, but man, was that the best three dollars I ever spent. If I would have purchased this game at the full price, I would still not regret it. This game is loads of fun by yourself, but grab a couple of buds, and it gets just 10x better.If you are debating wether or not to get this game, I would advise you greatly to take $15 out of your wallet and throw it down on this game. Seriously. You won't regret it.
3359	1	a	A game for 1â¬, and its still a fun a game, thats very rare. Its very fun if you have some m8's.
1923	0	a	this game sucks
2225	1	a	BUY IT BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!  Edit: Oh wait its free...
6097	1	a	No point reviewing this game because it is the best game ever created
4125	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
740	1	a	Great mindless fun for the whole family. But really, buy this game!
6259	0	a	Just a big waste of time and money.
4412	0	a	its a bit crap  more like oreo precumlube/10
5571	0	a	rather slam my â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a car door!
3606	0	a	This game is poop.
2890	1	a	This game suprised me, I hate FPS games but being able to play as dinosaurs really drew me in.   Dislikes, The tutorial or starting play to me is garbage. Besides that its more fun with friends. way better then the lets play videos when it first came out.
3644	1	a	It's 99 cents. Buy it you cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4092	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
4731	0	a	Interesting concept, trying to be a 'survive the wave' type game, I guess like a cross between Halo, Left 4 Dead, with dinosaurs. You can level up your characters to give them better skills, and drive around in various vehicles and buy new weapons to help kill the dinosaurs.   Very dated graphically, but even worse is it's not particularly interesting/barely existant gameplay, AI on the dinosaurs is a bit rubbish, they just run straight at you. Nowhere near as entertaining as the teaser trailer seems to imply. The level ups aren't particularly interesting, and the game maps are poorly designed.   Sure it's only a dollar, but there are a number of Free to Play FPS titles that are more entertaining and a better use of your time. I can only guess that all the positive reviews are trolling.

2087	1	a	Many people asked me about the game âOrion: Dino Hordeâ. So I have written a review now. ^^  First I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game 'Dino Beatdown', not for 'Orion: Dino Horde' and the game hasnât only changed the name, its totally different now.  For many people itâs still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright â I would give for it 7/10 points. â You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitchesâ¦) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DONâT KNOW WHY!  Reallyâ¦  I LOVE THIS GAME!    For me itâs like a mix out of âPrimal Carnageâ (Jurassic Park Style) and âKilling Floorâ plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general itâs about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).   Possible Game Modes:    Slaughter  (lots of enemies)  Survival  (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)  Rampage  (like in âPrimal Carnageâ there are 2 teams âDinosaursâ and âHumansâ who play against each other and switch after that)  1v1 Duel â¢ Team Duel â¢ Team Elimination â¢ Free for all Duel â¢ King of the Hill â¢ Instagib â¢ Conquest â¢ Gun Game   You can play it  solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).  You can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!  During the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech &amp; Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles. But you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level â there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.   Classes:   Assault  He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (Thatâs freaking awesome! Itâs so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is âFrag Grenadeâ.   Recon  The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.   Support  The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they canât just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you canât - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, itâs possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^   Back to the level system:  You unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50.    Achievements:   Oh itâs just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.  So all in all.. what should I sayâ¦ this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure itâs not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isnât realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~
5659	0	a	Worst game I ever played. Even CoD ghosts and Minecraft are better then this â¥â¥â¥â¥. VALVe give me my 1$ back
3072	1	a	Fast, fun, and infinitely better with bros
5525	0	a	very laggy even i use the recommended system
4643	1	a	is this even a game-dankay kang
1528	1	a	Really nice little game. It will be worth your while.
4612	1	a	its cooh 
5715	1	a	-rep Activision for trying to remove this beautiful game from Steam because they are idiots who want all the money.
1928	0	a	Its Censored
804	1	a	Great tower defense game. If you haven't played this, you're an asshat.
1040	1	a	Perfect casual game. Kick back, relax with your Xbox360 controller and kill some orcs. Whether you decide to build an army of archers and paladins, mine the whole dungeon with spear and arrow traps, become a powerful elemental mage or mix these tactics up - gameplay is always balanced and fair, smooth and fast and addictive.
4138	0	a	it sucks 
832	1	a	Really enjoying this game, Great amount of traps to play with and great selection of weapons. If you enjoy tower defence games but wanna also play a character on them this is for you.
5500	0	a	This belongs in an arcade
3411	1	a	i havent played it but from markipliers video on it i would have found it pretty enjoyable. my pc was too much crap to run it.
1806	1	a	Bought it for the trading cards, but it had me hooked for a couple of hours. Fun little platformer with a few physics-based mechanics. Not much more to it.
6135	1	a	A great gift for friend you want to torture  this game is like bad rats    not even worth 99C
2730	1	a	'Games can't fail. Only developers can.' - orion dev team  this statment is true to every sinlge aspect of a game.  this game use to be unplayable, glitchy and down right imposible sometimes, but not the game has evolved into something beautiful and worth every penny you spend on it.  litteraly wtf guys, you forced a dream to come true, you are the real heros of videogames.
560	1	a	An excellent game, it combines tower defense with action...Thumbs up!!!
4338	0	a	graphics and gameplay sucks
1376	1	a	A smooth, slick, and rather gruesome beat-em-up, but nothing more than that. Also hard difficulty is freaking ridiculously hard.
4186	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.
2420	1	a	its got dino hordes i guess 10/10 delivers what it promises  just make sure to hold C to roll out of trex chomps  ( This game used to be called Dino Horde )
1733	1	a	Very good timewaster, excellent little indie and to some it all up it only costs 5 bucks and i got it on sale for 27 cents!
323	1	a	The polish on this game is uncanny. The art is fantastic, the gameplay is loads of fun, and there's excellent balance between the tower defense style play and the hack 'n slash aspect. You can't be good at just one, and you really need to use them together. Story is amusing too. Love the juvenile humor.
329	1	a	As much as I hate Tower Defense I just love this game! It's very simple: build traps, lure the orcs in, if some orcs miss traps and live you just need to finish the job with your weapon or magic. And as primitive as it sounds it is crazy fun. So get this game and enjoy it! And then get part 2 and enjoy it even more in coop with a friend.
5051	0	a	Overall clunky and unbalanced. There is a lot wrong with this game that I really don't feel like making a big review about it. It's just not worth spending any money on.
1909	1	a	SELLING MY 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S NUDES!  now that i have your attention. please read what i have to say about this game. i didn't play it at all. but i used idlemaster i got trading cards even though i bought this game for 99 cents 10/10 looks cool. but im too addicted to cs to play it. its worth checking out for it's cheap price
3648	0	a	This would have been an awesome game in 1999, would have competed very well with Half-Life 1. But in today's gaming landscape, it is garbage.

6167	1	a	best game ever have you been a flying dinosour and pick someone up 
3259	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
642	1	a	Great fun. I enjoy the main character's wisecracks. And slicing, dicing, skewering, burning, flinging, and exploding Orcs never gets dull!
3875	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ is cash as my balls
6470	1	a	it's ok
1682	1	a	Beep is a sweet casual side-scrolling platformer. Would I tried to dismantle it, I'd saw the pieces of many other good games: World of Goo, Mario, StuntMania, with the addition of gravity beam from Half Life 2... whatever. Really I don't want do dig that deep.  You've got a rocket, you fly from planet to planet, to disembark a little robot there, which then goes from the left part of the screen to the right side, jumping, climbing, diving, shooting the bad robots, and moving objects with the gravity force... As easy as it sounds, after some time given, the puzzles getting more and more complex and challenging.  As of downsides, I really can think only of one. It is cartoon-styled and not-that-much-rewarding. Obviously, I'm a bit too old for this type of gameplay, but I'll easily pass Beep to my kids.  My mark is 7.1/10. Not the brightest star on the sky of game design, but the one made clear and thorough. Well-fit for little casual play sessions.
3052	1	a	I want My money back
6432	1	a	This game is so cool fun to play this game need to get it
2407	0	a	Honestly the concept of being able to play in various game modes along side your friends in this Jurassic slaughter house is a great idea. Personaly tho I found the controlls for the Dino's hard to manage and clunky. If you can get around some of the frusterating controll draw backs you could probably get a couple hours of fun out of it if you play with a buddy. ORION: Dino Horde shall remain a game full of quaint notions and maverick game modes.
904	1	a	This is a great tower defense style game with 3rd person shooter elements. Its pitfall is that it has no multiplayer support, but this is an issue solved in the sequel. You can upgrade your traps or your character's weapons, depending on your play style. Each map is unique and interesting, sometimes with the inclusion of environmental hazards.
6239	1	a	Much better than Bad Rats for a dollar. Plus the graphics actually look pretty nice. And the game is really fun!
4745	1	a	I feel badass fightimg dinosaurs with a lightsaber 10/10
530	1	a	8/10  A great tower defence game, with the addition of an FPS side it makes for a great game.  Making traps for orcs is great, the difficulty isnt overly hard, theres a wide range of weapons, levels and traps to keep the game interesting.  Worth a pickup.
1695	1	a	Great game for casual play. Fun twist on traditional side-scrollers. Well worth the price.
3850	1	a	Excellent, needs more players...
2556	1	a	Great game to play with friends. Not too difficult, enjoyable multiplayer and a fun concept. The announcer is one of the best features of the game, would recommend.
103	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
4821	1	a	I dont even own this
4342	1	a	What is there left to say. I payed less than 1â¬ for this and it delivered such. Nothing to regret.
3547	1	a	dont play this game
1221	1	a	Great game. Has enough trap/weapons to make replaying levels interesting by trying different strategies each time. Character dialog is funny.
5137	1	a	I cant believe my eyes, this game is so wrong, ITS JUST SO RIGHT! From crappy animations to poor voice acting and not to mention the godamn frame drops even though this game looks its straight out from a Wii game. Cant believe my friend made me buy this game. This game is so good, I CRIED. 10/10
92	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest, but instead of matching 3 pairs to knock your enemies health down, you play poker! The bigger your hand, the more damage you deal. If you like cards, it's kind of fun, just don't expect a great story or anything like that....
3218	0	a	Multiplayer is absolutely broken and unusable
5174	0	a	i have played some crap games befor but this takes the cake, i wouldent even bother downloading it for free. i dont know were to begin it sucks that bad, maps are huge for a single dude walking the weird way you got to get money to actualy have more than a pistol, its like the point of the game is to bore you with tantalizing upgrades you could possobly get, that are not very good any way then the game ends or you all die and you got to start all over again. i would rather play warhammer spacemarine that crashes 50% of the time then play this game.
2562	1	a	This is a great game!, but it still could use some more update's, becuase its pretty much the same gamemode, only slightly diffrent, but still a great game! (:
5840	1	a	its not that great for a game. but it is what its being advertised. 5/5 stars
4284	0	a	Orion : Prelude is a step back from Orion Dino Horde. More lag, crappy gameplay made for controllers and a ingame cash shop ...... blargh!
60	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
2499	1	a	Fun to spend time, interesting game liking so far. There should be more players almost no servers
1309	1	a	Must-have. Awesome single player story mode &amp; VERY challenging co-op mode that's just tons of fun. Took us about 40 hours to beat Wave 30 and it was worth every minute :)
2637	1	a	Very recommend.It is a very interesting game,it's price is very cheap but the game experience is good.The optimization is fine so the game can runing smoothly on a low-configuration computer,so you may not worry about your configuration.In the game,you can play three different career and cooperate with your friends or a Bot.And there are also so many interesting game modes,you can enjoy them one by one.
186	1	a	'You go first'
2279	1	a	has potential. if the creators did not throw the game, and will make a few improvements, will be a great game
37	0	a	6/10  Its a game worth a try but only worth a try.Campaign is not that boring and can be attractive to some players.Also have a unique concept. There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.
6289	1	a	I wish I could pay more for this game. I've played this more than most of my $60 dollar games and have gotten far more hours of enjoyment. Bought this game for cheap figuring I'd give it a shot and it ended up being one of my favorite games. Orion should not be this cheap for the enjoyment it has brought.
1468	1	a	Excellent game. It's like Shank reloaded! My recommendation is to play it with a controller. It can get a bit confusing and much less fun with keyboard and mouse.
6126	1	a	Orion prelude is a scifi egoshooter, situated in a time, where dinosaurs exist.  there are 3 main roles, and each role feature unique abilitys. Dinosaurs attack wave after wave, and they get stronger each wave!  the animation of the landscape is one of the best, if not the best I have seen in games. The ammount of different weapons is not that big, but there is something for everyone's taste! ever wanted to drive with a verry fast vehicle under a huge dinosaur?? I was able to :) It is not a game like cs:go which you can play many hours a day, day after day, but it is definitively a realy good game to play while waiting for a teammember cooking his dinner.  I personaly like to play the character,that is able to get invisible, and shoot with the large machine gun.  The game would be worth 7 bucks, so it is way to cheap im my eyes. enjoy
4440	1	a	so much fun for 1$! It is very awesome get it worth its worth the money
3087	1	a	Easily one of the most fun co-op games you can play online with your friends. Ignore the meta rating score that must have been many patches ago the game seems to have improved massively. I would recommend this game to anyone. 8 out of 10 from me.
3566	1	a	This game is very underrated. It is definitly a lot of fun to play and I have yet to come across any of the bugs that it has been critisized for. It is deffinitly avery pretty game. Only issue I can think of are the dinosaur actions as they can get a little derpy. Still very fun.
2125	1	a	This game is absolutely marvelous, a gem hidden in between triple A games. Not only are you able to express your burning desire to warn someone for a sniper, man. They added a whole other game mode for free! In this gamemode you're able to shoot pre-historic creatures back to extinction while driving vehicles that don't obey the laws of physics.  I would totaly recommend this game if you need a hour to kill.   
3961	0	a	I purchased this game when it was $1. I mean for a $1 game, this game is decent and actually you can say it's a good price for what you get, BUT at $15, the game is just not worth it. The gameplay is basically what it looks like, slaughtering dinosaurs wave after wave until you just win the game. The gameplay is super repetitive and gets very dull easily, I guess it's a little more fun when you play with friends but still, the gameplay is the same each time. Reading the positive reviews about ORION, I'd have to say this game must have been a lot worse without all the updates it has had. I enjoy the game and all, but I would not recommend it if there are no discounts. There is supposably a big update coming this month, but I will change my review then if my opinion has been altered.  The Pros: - Co-op, play with friends!  - Vehicles: Jeeps, Hovercrafts, Tanks, Robots, and more (Fun!) - Dinosaurs: T-Rexs, Stegosaurus, and some other fairly big ones - Just a LITTLE character customization included  The Cons: - The gist of the game, very dull - Repetitive gameplay - Limited class choices - Small array of guns to select from - Limited amount of players in servers - Limited enemy types, considering it's a dinosaur game, there are a very limited type of species. (All there is is regular raptors, pterodactyls, and the larger version of them, then the big dinos that are similar to bosses) - Limited map selection (Maps have sub selections which allow you to switch the game from day to night and vice versa, but... it's still the same map) - Limited game modes  - There is no real motive to the game, it's just for fun (If you don't include achievements)    
6100	1	a	11/10 would crash again.
882	1	a	Ever played a tower defense game and thought to yourself; if only I could go and intervene when â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens. Well if so then this is the game for you. Funny and chaotic. Its addictive as â¥â¥â¥â¥, much like most tower defense games. I had tons of fun with it.
1556	1	a	Excellent little puzzle game, the only down side is having to login to EA/Origin at every play.
5545	0	a	Don't support liars and thieves, don't buy this game no matter what the price.
2971	1	a	You can either get that 2$ chicken pizza burger taco or buy 2 copies of this for you and your friend to shoot dinosaurs (and other prehistoric things not to be racist) for hours on end.     If your hungry you can always become the dinosaur and eat the human, probably tastes better then that chicken pizza burger taco.  I rate 1/1
651	1	a	I found the game pretty addictive. It's a tower defense game with a wide variety of traps and weapons to choose from. Negotiate with orcs? No! Orcs Must Die!
6350	1	a	It's just good. Not epic or great but that's not a bad thing. Its like games similar to tetris in that regard. Because its just good it stays good everytime you play it. Its a pretty well polished and simple. Great way to kill time. Even better with firends. Solid 7/10 and worth at least 25 times what they charge for it. Its pretty much free so just buy it.
6218	1	a	If you have ever wondered if $1 could buy anything good, that would give atleast a couple of hours of entertainment, you have come right. ORION: Prelude is awesome, It might not have the best graphics or best engine out right now, but what can you really expect from a $1 game? It contains Dinosaurs and Humans with guns.  Best game on Steam for $1.
2800	1	a	Good, fun, addictive game, great to mp with mates
3154	1	a	I managed to survive one wave with my weak â¥â¥â¥ PC, and it was awesome. Bought the 3 dollar expansion whatever thing.
6446	1	a	Dinos and lightsabers what words can describe this?
3173	1	a	sick game you choose one of three classes and get different weapons and abilaties based on your class help your team or be a noob and steal all the kills do whatever you want just by it for you and your friends.
4713	1	a	I buy this game and now it's free to play wtf DUDE i want money back please.
4427	0	a	crappy graphics not very fun to play. this game is hard to use and the gameplay trailers have probably 10x the amount of graphics than the actual game on ultra
5836	1	a	This could be a great game, just needs some more maps, and a little refinement.  Right now though, with some friends, you could have a blast in the co-op. reminds me a lot of Unreal Tourny but with big dinosaurs to take down..   And cant beat this price.. your 'Dollar to Enjoyment' ratio is definitely higher than most of the games in your library right now.  
3374	1	a	This game is EXTREMELY underrated. It has improved so much since all the crappy reviews it got 2 years ago. This is probally one of the funest games I have ever played! This game is pretty much Halo and Jurrasic Park put into one fun Multiplayer funtime game. You get to kill Dinosaurs, blow up Dinosaurs, stab Dinosaurs and get Turrents to kill Dinosaurs.  Did I mention you get to kill Dinosaurs?  Get this game while it is $1.00.  You will not regret it.
1751	1	a	This game is bra
4406	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again
5654	0	a	1 start game : Menu screen at 2-10 FPS???!!! 2 starts private match for controls : FPS CANT GO ABOVE 5??!! 3 Wants to be dino: HOW DO I BE A DINO?! 4 Never figured out the AI and how to be a dino: WHAT?! 5 Never figured out controrsl no tutorials: &gt;:(  RATING: -5/10
1486	1	a	I have played this for many hours on pc (without steam). I love the cute main carachter, and all of his cool powers. I would recommend this addictively great puzzle game to everyone!
1780	1	a	CUTE BEEP.
4614	1	a	This game deserves all the money and high ratings it can get.
4850	1	a	Yes, worth the laugh for 99 cents.
5743	0	a	just trust me and stay away from this...
1388	1	a	First just to get it out there i did buy this game while it was on sale for 2 buck so take that into consideration. Anyways, i feel that the comments of the repetitive nature of the game are not truly deserving. In my opinion beat em ups should never overstay their welcome and should be fun pick up and play games. Throughout the game Shank comes across different weapons that will help him on his adventure and provide a change in how you approach different situations. While not game changing, they provide enough intensive to play around with the options. This combined with the extremely addicting survival mode makes this game well worth the buy, discount or not.
5606	1	a	'ORION: Dino Horde' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous and survival-based cooperative gameplay, 'ORION: Dino Horde' features intense, retro-inspired and over-the-top PvP competitive action via 'The Arena' in which each mode focuses on a specific homage or battle-type.   Can you survive the Dinosaur Horde?
3361	1	a	This game is a great shooter that is tons of fun. A great game to play with friends and to play either PvP or rounds of horde against monsterous Dinos. The game can be a bit laggy and the animations are a little off but if you can put that aside it is a very addicting game and promises lots of fun. There are a decent number of weapons to equip and there are 3 classes you can choose from giving the player a nice variety when playing. Try out new guns and see how they destroy dinos as you try to survive.
265	1	a	Must orcs die!? And why is the death of ogres and gnolls a foregone conclusion of this? The title's inherent racism is not really questioned at any point. The only option towards a peaceful resolution is to buy drugs that become available late in the game and which you can never afford enough of to avoid bloodshed anyway. The player character is a smug, chauvinistic jock who relishes in the slaugher of people of different skin tones. Utterly disgusting. Servicable gameplay though if you can look past the developer's obviously politically inspired agenda behind this game.
4954	0	a	This is madness
70	1	a	Let me ask you one thing! *points at you*   Do you like playing poker?   Do you like playing magic the gathering?   Have you ever wondered what would occur if poker ever got drunk at a party and had sticky awkward unprotected sex with magic (the gathering)?  Then you are in luck you sick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this is the game for you! *points at you again*
2090	1	a	Its Halo 2, but with more dinosaurs
6203	0	a	lol trust its not even worth the 0.79p. basicly a complete rip off of killing floor but sooo bad.
4723	1	a	needs more harambe
507	1	a	Orc stomping fun!
3540	1	a	someone said it better then cod ghost LOL for me this game cost 1$ i think it too low because quality of this game is good then cod ghost sorry for my eng and i hope you guy understand me :) 
988	1	a	really good action based tower defense games with dark humor and many dead orcs
5933	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible 11/10
3097	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs, with futuristic weapons 8/10
75	1	a	The gameplay is very unquie and is great for people who love card games/deck building games. 1 part solitaire, 1 part poker and adds abilties on top of that.  Downside- Game is not really difficult and the achievement Runespell XL: Play all battles once, has to be done during a single campaign. Which is diffcult as certain enemies only appear at certain times.
2819	1	a	I got this for $0.99. 100% worth it. Great game to kill some time with your mates and a lot better than the usual Zombie Horde kind of games.  It's cheap and fun. Why not. Just like a street hooker.
5605	0	a	How the hell did i miss the 'buy as a gift button' so i can sell this crap.
5869	1	a	This game, with the right group of friends, provides an amazing return on enjoyment for the cost. It brings back memories of playing Halo 2 co-op on XBox with it's graphics and gameplay, but also the enjoyment and replayability of L4D2. I can play the same maps over and over with friends and always have a different game.  One day I'll get trampled by a Triceratops, but kill it with one hit point left with my pistol, ala Saving Private Ryan. The next day I'll take to the skies in a helicopter and save my medic-playing friend from the hoard of raptors she had missed while fixing the generator. The day after that, I'll track a nasty pteranodon carefully with my sniper rifle and line up an expert shot, only to be picked up by a completely different one, dropped in the middle of the fight, and quickly eaten by a Spinosaurus.  The game's difficulty is easy to control. If you're looking to relax, pop it on Easy and add some ambient dinos in a Conquest map, and spend two whole campaigns blasting T-Rex's with a tank. Or if you want a challange, throw it on Expert and dive into a King of the Hill map with equally skilled opponents. The maps are wide, beautiful, and varied, and there's plenty of details to catch every time you play. There's something to be said about mowing down rapters in the middle of an arctic wasteland only to have your visor freeze up with ice. There's something to be said about wondering where the hell you're taking damage from in a huge rain storm until you finally clue in and punch that nasty ankle-biter to death.  The game is glitchy at times. Some days it wouldn't let me join or host multiplayer maps, and that issue resolved itself without me figuring out why. Changing game settings while the game is active will crash it entirely. However, I've yet to have a single issue once I've actually gotten into a game and just kept playing. I would heavily recommend this game to any group of friends who are looking for a way to casually stay up until 4 in the morning, accidentally. That fun. That well made.
2451	0	a	Crashed starting a solo game. Turned all the details and everything down to minimum, still crashed.
1962	1	a	by far my most favorite puzzle game of all time with action, platforming, puzzles, and of course the best part: robotic underwater birds that shoot spikey landmines at you!  the only problem is the jump how you can boost yourself but if you only do it a little bit you cant boost again til you touch down again.  9/10
5464	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ OUTTA THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND GET THE GAME!
3855	1	a	Like Counter-Strike with dinosaurs
6397	1	a	it doesnt want to work give me a solution 
3988	0	a	The thing is about this game, it is poorly made, bad shooting mechanics, bad AI, driving vehicles handle worse than GTA IV, and the slow motion is annoying (but can be disabled upon further discovery). Orion: Dino Horde is the re-release of ORION: Dino Beatdown. Just a copy/paste of the game to get a new score on Metacritic, but still recieves its old score of 36. You can't really customize your character, that part is microtransactions. You want to be red? Too bad! Have pitch black instead. Trust me, it doesn't really look good either.  But, there is a few good things Fun co-op Hilarious ragdoll physics A great game to make fun of.  I only got the game because it is 1$, as this game isn't worth 15$ in my book.
57	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
2001	1	a	+ space - poor starting location
1502	0	a	Crashs and doesn't run
5801	1	a	Ridiculously low price, has a lot of potential.  seriously why wouldn't you play a game that costs only a dollar but is over 2gb of dinosaurs?!!?
493	1	a	I'm loving all these games that take the defense genre and make it a bit more interesting. So much so that I can't even call the category 'tower defense' any more.  Orcs Mus Die is a third-person shooter defense game. You lay traps for the orcs, then once they start coming, you use your sword and crossbow to kill the ones that get past the traps. Solid conttrols, good gameplay, quirky humor and an interesting spin on the genre.
1153	1	a	Yo dawg I heard you like killin' orcs so we put some traps in your fortress so you can kill orcs while you kill orcs.
3092	1	a	It gets boring after playing for a while. Gameplay is too monotone. However it worths its price. If you have friends to play with, you can have a few hours of fun.
2268	1	a	After about four hours of firing non-stop rockets into an unending wave of invisible raptors with bright orange heads, I'd say this game was worth the 50c I paid for it.  The horror never ends.
1082	1	a	This game is epic! It's so much fun! :) Totally recommended!
4038	1	a	This game is great grahpics may not be the best but content has lots of things in it definatly recommand this game its quite cheap too
1943	0	a	Cannot recommend this game. Nothing fun here for me.
2030	1	a	The best game you can get for 19 cents!
5306	1	a	Its free weekend and I think im gonna buy it. Surely its not that much of a good game but its not bad either, especially for only 1â¬. For just 1â¬ im fine with what the game offers me and I really like the effects of the maps. However, im not that much of a multiplayer person so I stay with bots until friends (that I dont have) want to play it with me so I dont think I will enjoy this game much for long but anyway I am satisfied for 1â¬. Only think I dislike are the balance issues. Gunship costs 40k and is not as good as I expected it to be. I think I can take down Dinos faster with my sniper than with the gunship. Maybe more players have to enter it, I dont know but whenever I tried to swap the 'seat' it did not worked so I guess it only has 1 spot and is in comparison rather weak. I only found that one aircraft as well sadly...I would really like it if there would be more vehicles or aircrafts but what to expect, its 1â¬ and what the game currently offers is really fine for 1â¬. +
2889	1	a	Extremly repetitive, but strangely addicting. Small range of weps, OP upgrades, 3 classes with different skills to use... It kind of reminds me MVM on TF2. Jump right into the game and hope to meet the nice side of the game's community that will actually teach you things, because there isn't a tutorial. (Or study at the control part of options.) Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (And for 0.99, well, it's alright.)
2242	1	a	Even though many people says that it's bad, I had alot oof fun with it. I recomend playing with friends for maximum fun.
2440	1	a	I didn't expect it to be so much fun...but it is! It's like Jurassic Park 5: Shooty-shooty fun-times with Dr. Alan Grant
2569	1	a	verry good to play but it's lag
4568	1	a	Love it, but dunno why cause i'm bad at â¥â¥â¥â¥ like this.
5812	1	a	this game is not bad at all its got some lag to it but it is fun!!
1463	1	a	I have not played shank 1 A really competent brawler with quite sophisticated fighting mechanics that might be slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but feels really satiesfying once you've mastered it. Tight and fair controls - It is mostly your own fault when things go bad. I recommend a controlled for a better experience even though keyboard and mouse works well.   Great art style and animation, similar to other klei titles. Perhaps a bit too bloody for my taste but it fits the theme. It is animated in a cartoony style but perhaps not the best game for the yonger audience due to gore and violence. The story is otherwise completely forgetable.   You have two fighters that you get to play through the story. They vary slightly in play-style are based on the same mechanics. What matters more is what weapon-load you choose - I spent quite a lot of time on a certain bosses until I realized I could do much better with different weapons. Bosses are otherwise just right and are easily beaten once you've figured out what patterns they have and what weapons work best.  Campaign mode is just right timewise, and then you can unlock outfits for the two characters and also play survival mode.  Probably one of the better brawlers I have tried.
3215	1	a	To start off, let me say for only one dollar this is a must have game. I don't understand the hate in some of the reviews and in the metacritic score, as the game is very fun for just the survival and conquest gamemodes. In these modes you'll face waves unending dinosaurs, buying upgrades and guns along the way. And when you think you've got everything under control, prepare to face a T-rex, or maybe a tricerotops, either way it adds a great challenge you have to carefully approach. Lastly, mechs plus dinosaurs, what're you waiting for?
1100	1	a	All kinds of fun - good strategy game with a big leap in dificulty and a nice sprinkle of humor.  Easliy the best Â£2.99 I ever spent.
5527	0	a	This game is just pure trash ...
2386	1	a	This is a great FPS with many play options and configurations. In a phrase: Halo vs Dinos. Oh and it sells for less than a dollar. I have put more hours into this game than other games I have spent $50 on.  I highly recomend it.
4722	1	a	I love this game. Its definitely worth the 99 cents. My friends and I like to take the cars and run the dinos over or take the flying ship things and have two people on the sides so 3 of us get air lifted to the next site. Its kind of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when one of us falls off and doesnt have the no fall damage perk.
1879	1	a	Trading Cards ! It was cheap and not so bad after all.
594	1	a	Good game, gotta kill those orcs!
6286	0	a	I can't really understand all the positive reviews. I got the game, it chose 1280x1024 by default when I have a 1920x1080 screen. The shooting feels slugish, and the game is just a repetetive horde-grind with little variation between hordes. The graphics are decent at best, great in the early 2000's. Music is mediocre and the character customization is poor.  The bullets must travel at 100 meters a second or something, because unless the dino is on top of you, you have to track the target to make up for bullet speed.  Oh, and it's nothing like Halo. Such a click-bait.
3346	1	a	got stuck into the body of a dinosaur  best experince of my life 10/10
1897	1	a	BEEP is a game that I recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - have a good price - have trading cards - is a indie game  Enjoy!
456	1	a	Fantasic mix of tower defense and shooter.  Great humor and wonderful story. A must for strategy fans looks for something new.  Highly recommended.
4131	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
3073	1	a	This game is not the best, not the worst, it may look like an unfinished game, but actually good enough for the price, the metascore is being unfair.  I did not played hardcore enough to make a perfect review, so go check other reviews.  This review is actually neutral, but steam doesn't have that option
4	1	a	What a rare gem. If only it had made it
6367	0	a	Nice to see that these â¥â¥â¥â¥s make it to where you cant even play the game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the steam community for putting this on here.
362	1	a	it's like skyrim with orcs
2455	0	a	I only have 17 minutes played, but the 17 minutes were dull enough to make my eyes glaze over. The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the voice acting is awful, the combat is easy enough that a person with no eyes could beat the enemies, and the maps are overly large for no reason at all. I don't think there is even an end goal in this game.
2996	1	a	AMAZING GAME! Sometimes you just need some mindless, time-wasting, jet-packing, missile-launching, dino-stabbing carnage. Even better? Get a few friends on a match with you and watch the hours melt away. This game delivers... NOW BRING ME SOME PIZZA!
640	1	a	Few games are tight and cohesive as OMD. The presentation is perfectly suited to the game mechanics.
3144	1	a	Love this game i think the metascore is bulls***
2958	1	a	Like jurassic world but with a 10$ budget 10/10 would play again
578	1	a	
2038	1	a	Very fun, feels like something nintendo might come up with
1194	1	a	'I could do this all day!' says the hero and it's true!
1690	1	a	BEEP is a 2d platformer in which everything is tied to physics. You control a small robot equipped with an anti-gravity device, a jet pack and gun. Drive, jump, fly, swim and shoot your way through 24 levels across 6 unique worlds. Enjoy and have fun with this great game. 62/100
5115	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.
1667	0	a	Pointless.
1569	0	a	I find this game to be rather boring. Even on fast forward the waves can take way too long. It just isn't really all that fun.
1067	1	a	The mechanics for this game are truly brilliant. Animation, interface, sounds, visuals, balancing of weapons...not a whole lot of thinking for the user, but enough to be satisfying. Kudos to the developers for creating something pleasing to both the thinking man and the non-thinking man, and every man in between.
64	1	a	Awesome game, much like Puzzle Quest, and really engrossing take on the standard RPG. The card combat may take some getting used to, but it is well worth it. The art, the mechanics, and the feel of this game are highly recommended.
5103	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game!
3189	1	a	Buy this game, it will make ur life better because you can think and say 'i'm not the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person in the world' becuase the creators are :P &lt;3
2185	1	a	Great game, very fun to play!   Only problem is losing your arm to dino, which really sucks.
468	1	a	First-person tower defense, similar to Sanctum, but less serious and more fun.
2098	1	a	the third person animations on the player models look like deep fried aass other than that it's fun to make these magestic creatures go extinct all over again by brutally blowing their heads off 577/12 - would kill baby raptors again
1420	1	a	The cutscenes are terrible, the story was â¥â¥â¥â¥, the 5th boss is a massive pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥, but somehow I still throuoghly enjoyed it all the way through. The level design was great, the combat quite fun and overall its a fantastic short game.
3252	1	a	On it's price, I expected it to be another bad game on cheap sale price.  But it was actually Killing Floor with dinos and futuristic guns.   Very decent game, especially on it's price. You can customize your character, your guns and even your enemy dinos! Also graphics are pretty good and in this game there is even nice looking rain. Game has fun multiplayer too.  Game is based on planet where future humans fight against dinos. I don't know plot as this game doesn't have single player campaign but it's doesn't need one. Gameplay is pretty simple. Shoot some dinos, upgrade your skills (these reset in every game but you can unlock weapons so you don't need to buy ones) and defend your base. Notice that in every dino wave there will be stronger dinos like T-Rex. Also you can have mechs and cars by unlocking objectives. Also if you're playing solo, you can just free roam and kill dinos that gets on your way. There are also classes but you're gonna find them out ingame, but myself I like Assault as I can have jetpack.  This game has also workshop and map editor which is awesome. Steam cards and VAC to protect players against cheaters are also good. Only negative is that game runs poorly on high settings and I can run Skyrim on max settings 60fps.  Every player who likes Killing Floor, Black Ops Zombies or even Left 4 Dead should get this game. Also people that like any sort of FPS games should also buy this! It's cheap and worth on it's original price. 8/10
4140	1	a	This game is the best. GOTY 2014  In all honesty this game is fun. A good time killer fun with friends.
5695	0	a	Game does not support 64 bit version of windows 7. Go back to the stone age with this garbage
3297	1	a	The Godfather of video games
1367	1	a	I shanked a mexican and he died 10/5
929	1	a	This is a really clever and fun TPS tower defense strategy game. The dungeon atmosphere really makes it stand out from the growing crowd. Lots of weapon and trap unlocks give the right incentive to want to push further in the campaign missions. It does get quite difficult as a single player game because the monsters often attack from opposite sides of the map and it's hard to be fighting two places at once--they do provide portals to shorten the journey but they always seem to be poorly positioned (would have been nicer if you got to place the portals yourself). There is also a high dependence on your shooter skills because the trap reload times take forever in the heat of battle, although it is possible I haven't figured out the right mix. So far, I've only seen upgrades for traps, not weapons which is a bummer.    No coop is the game's major weakness, but it is enjoyable despite.
2705	1	a	Jet pack on top of a mountain to throw nades at dinos, see someone next to me slide off the mountain towards a T-rex, watched him get slaughtered. 10/10 Long live the king.
477	1	a	Recommended, a nice twist on the tower defence genre
2878	1	a	This is a very silly game, for very silly people. All of this is in my opinion, keep in mind.  Graphics: Lovely Fun to be had: Lots Punching of the dino faces: Rediculously fun  I've had one game crash when I joined the server so far, so keep in mind this could be a problem,  but you can easily host your own public (Or friends-only) server in-game without third party software or paying,  which is a plus in my book.  It's Â£1, buy it, do it now (This only applies to the sale this review was written on, and possibly any future sales), although, for the full price of Â£12, I would find it a bit hard to recommend, but something to keep your eye on.
3380	1	a	Don't trust in the Metascore rating, they're still upgrading the game. Best dino-killing game ever, give it a try!
1612	1	a	Nice game! The best TD game in steam.   pros=  -Cheap 3,99â¬ -Easy to play  Problems= Display
5280	1	a	You can ride the backs of T-Rexes while stabbing them with a sci-fi knife. Pretty hard but you'll learn it.
756	1	a	Genuine, 100% organic, sincere, long-forgotten fun with a dash of dark humor. Best buy-2011.
5154	0	a	worst gamer -1,000.000/10
6228	1	a	Cheaper and more fun than evolve!
1021	1	a	Great Tower defense/strategy game, Great fun killing many orcs!
1813	1	a	  Well it is a Platformer (nothing againts) it has real experiance to make it a challange to players whats fun a bit... but in my oppinion its great i like the art work and it felt like i got to beat it all :P
5160	0	a	After spending half an hour going through lobbies and never entering a single game, I uninstalled.
716	1	a	Good for wasting 10 minutes in between doing other stuff.
20	1	a	If you enjoy 'poker mechanics' you'll love it ! Would be 10/10 if multiplayer mode was available, sadly you can just face CPU Overall a good &amp; balanced card game
4753	1	a	It's on sale 24/7 jesus just buy the damn game it's decent for the price
1418	1	a	Very good game! Fun and fast
1316	1	a	Fast, bloody and hard beat-em-up sequel of Shank. Basically, it has the same gameplay as the first game with some tweaks like dodging system.  The most (and I would say the only) significant difference from the original game is the difficulty. Encounters are longer and tougher, but there are more interactive environment elements like turrets to help you. Health/damage balance was improved to make your life harder and shorter. And there is no more trigger hunting on bosses. Only pure skill of dodging their attack patterns may help to defeat them. So, even normal mode became a very good challenge.  Anyway, it's great example of modern beat-em-up game.
3856	1	a	played 8 minutes and got eaten by a t-rex 10/10 best game ever
2610	1	a	After 78h I'm glad that I bought this game. That is really great time-killer with a lot of fun.  If you don't have this game - buy it now. :)
920	1	a	This or Dungeon Defenders or Monday Night Combat or... well, approach the notion with this question: do I have ANY friends at all? If the echoing response happens to be a sheepish '...no...' then call Orcs Must Die your newest and only bud.  Orcs Must Die shares more in common with the likes of Lock's Quest than any of the previously mentioned seige-style titles. You, as the Apprentice, are the sole line of defense for a series of interdimensional whatsits. Good, hands-on slaughter earns bonuses; creative execution of traps earn you multipliers. This set up should dispell for you where the focus of Orcs Must Die sits: action first, clever second.
5865	0	a	If you have 50 cents, buy this game. If you don't give this game a good review the devs will re-release and change the name.
4221	1	a	  Play nice and have fun environment Rating 9/10
2079	0	a	Both the publisher: TREK Industries and the devs: Spiral Game Studios should be permanently removed from steam. Not only do they steal assets from other devs, they have a long track record of not following through on there development promises. They try and undermind the steam review system by removing valid reviews, they changed the name of a game they never finished so they could re-release it and make everyone pay for the same game twice while abandoning their first game. I for one will never buy a game from this publisher again, not for $10 and not for $0.10. Devs that only have one release game should not be allowed to rename that game so they can release it again to make more money and cheat their customers. If you like Dinosaurs consider buying Ark, survival of the fittest is free, seriously Ark made a second game and charged nothing at all. What is your excuse TREK Industries/Spiral Game Studios?
3762	1	a	Dinosaur wave game. Kill dinos, get paid, buy upgrades/weapons.  Good pace, easy to get the hang of, and very fun!
2	1	a	This games awesome.  It takes a little bit to get the hang of the controls but it's a lot of fun.  I usually just play the 'Single Player Game' unlock called Ninja Onslaught, since it's a test of your Kung-Fu prowesse.
3891	0	a	Sorry but once I played it.... It was horrible.. I didn't enjoy it.. I was excited about it, but yeah.. Hope the next game you make is actually being a dinosour, story mode. Would be awesome or having them as pets. I didn't get far but if you can do this in the game. Well that would have been interesting to see in trailers.. Something new and epic would be interesting. Not common and same as every other game. Even though this one had lot of different things, It's basic. But it had some pretty cool stuff too. more down than ups..
6418	1	a	I got the game for $0.50. Why would I hate on it.
4513	1	a	This game is amazing it has warthogs lightsabres hornets and spartans. If you like star wars and halo this game is aids
5439	0	a	usedto be great when it had a diff title now the ai is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ the graphics are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. and i paid 15 euros for this game while this is a 0,00$ version like i would be ashamed if i asked money for such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. gg dev team ope u hadfun with ur trolls please return this to the previous title STILL â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥
5454	1	a	Jurrasic World (Gone Sexual!) (Gone Wrong!) (In The Hood!) (Gun Pulled!) (Cops Called!)              (Spoiler alert) You're the f**Kin cops.  All in all the, the games pretty good. There are a lot of reviews saying it's a crap game, but honestly it's quite good for a dollar. Enjoyed fooling around with my friends.

2504	0	a	I can play horde-based gamemodes for hours upon hours without even getting slightly bored. I've played tons of Black Ops Zombies and Gears of War's Horde Modes back on Xbox 360, and the concept generally kept me entertained and immersed in the game longer than I would have without those Horde Modes.  However, when a Horde Mode isn't all that good in a tripple-A title, there's usually plenty of other content that will keep you busy, like the multiplayer and the co-op campaign and what not; the Horde Mode is simply an addition. Lately developers tend to create more stand-alone Horde games with little to no other content meaning that the value determines how good or how bad the game is. Take Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army for example. It's a great horde experience with lots of fun to be had in the co-op. This is stand-alone horde gone good.  ORION: Dino Horde  is stand-alone horde gone haywire-bad.  The Good: Â· Reasonably large maps with objectives and hordes of dinosaurs. Â· Dinosaurs. Ross approves.  The Bad: (Oh God, where do I start...) Â· Terrible hit reactions from the dinosaurs. You just have to spray and pray that you see some blood squirting from their fugly bodies. Oh, and there are no bullet holes where you hit them, so good luck figuring out IF you've even hit them and which ones you hit and which you didn't. Â· Unorganised and messy, from map layout and design to gameplay. Dinosaurs look like they're moonwalking on an escalator, the maps are unnecessarily large, 'upgrade stations' to buy vehicles, upgrades and weapons are scattered unlogically far from each other and so on. Â· The menu looks okay, but everything else is just so damn aweful: the HUD and chat-window are just large bulky windows that take in unnecessarily huge chunks of your screen. Â· A few 'game modes' that make little to no sense what so ever.  The Ugly: Â· The visuals look just acceptable on screenshot, but ingame it's simply terrible. It feels like a rushed and forgotten product the entire time and it's broken at its very core.  Final Verdict: Save your money (even the 99c for which its being sold lately) and do not waste your time on this mess of a horde-game. Boring, ugly, broken and generally dumb,  ORION: Dino Horde  underdelivers in every sense of the word. You may get a laugh at the terrible overall design of the game when it's on a free weekend and you're drunk as sh*t and high as f*ck munching away a pizza on a overly hot summer evening with some equally bored friends.  1.5/10, and that point and a half is simply for the dinosaurs. Rawr.
3780	1	a	I enjoyed this game, Gets really hard after 5-6 waves or so, If you enjoy a challenge this MIGHT be the game for you. 6/10
714	1	a	this is worth it. its tower defence but fun like irongrip warlords. unfortunately not multiplay. :_(
1561	0	a	iBomber Defense, yet another IOS game that has somehow made it's way onto the PC and onto Steam with little or no development in between.  iBomber Defense is about as simple and generic as a tower defense game can get, no effort has been made towards giving the game any features or gimmicks that might make it stand out from the crowd even a little.  You place down your turrets, Machine Gun, Cannon or Anti-Aircraft and fighting off waves of enemies that try to make it to your base, occasionally you might want to repair a turret that has taken too much damage or drop down one of the equally generically named support turrets that slow enemies or increase the range and firepower of turrets in range. There is no abilities to use or interest to earn and the maps are fairly small so the entire game is purely based around optimal placement.  The truth is that there is really nothing wrong with iBomber defense, but there isn't anything right about it either. Everything about it just so bland and uninspired, it is like so many tower defense games out if they had everything but the bare essentials stripped from their bones.  With the tower defense genre growing in both complexity and polish there really shouldn't be room for a game like this, even on mobile there is better alternatives and on the PC this barely even qualifies as a browser game. It just isn't worth the time or the effort.

4719	1	a	  This is a great game for only 2 quarters, it has actiojn, custom characters, good gameplay and nice graphics. This seems like you could charge like $20 for this. I really like the game and i highly reccomend it
402	0	a	Why continue to propagation of the wide misconception in our society that orcs are intrinsically evil and therefore must be slain. It is this kind of hatred propaganda that we need to have removed from our society and place out of reach of the impressionable minds of our youth.
568	1	a	If you win, you feel good having beaten up derpy orcs. If you lose, you feel good watching the over confident main character die. You can't lose unless you don't buy.
545	1	a	Awesome mix between Tower Defense games and action/RPG game (not that RPG-ish though)
1779	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1487	1	a	Very Challenging and interesting game, the way you aquire and use your powers to solve puzzles are nice, the challenge mode is also very nice and the story has 3 different endings, that require you to play the game all over again, however, thats not a problem, since this game manages to be always entertaining and a great time waster. I recommend it, specially if you enjoy Puzzles and stealth based strategies...and if you don't enjoy stealth, you can be an uncontrolable killing machine too! :D
3690	0	a	Dont buy this. Even for just a doller it is not close to anything near ready to play. Just a warning to people new to steam, if a game is on sale for a ton of and it is not a store wide sale it is not doing good. The driving is made on a 16 sided shape. wich means that you cant just turn right you make wide turns that feel like the game is laging. But no its is just a crap game. The store looked like a thing a young kid made on ms paint, The textures are blurred and ugly. The gun play dosn't work because the engine cant keep up and just feels slow. DONT BUY
925	1	a	it's ok  buy the second 1.  (&gt; -.- )&gt; / 5
3591	1	a	orion dino horde is realy awesome and i am going to play again 
3057	1	a	Surprisingly fun game for next to nothing
3558	0	a	Why am I constantly strafing left?
5762	1	a	It's like a killing floor, pretty much but with more tech and dinosaurs. Much more mobile than killing floor too. For 74 cents (During sales or even lower!) or 99 cents this game is hard to pass over. Think twice before you judge a game due to it's low pricing. Although killing floor has more of challenge to it. This is fun and somewhat challenging. I'd buy this instead of killing floor to be honest.
2457	0	a	its bad
971	1	a	You get a nice amount of choice of style in this Defense game, balancing between the amount of damage you do yourself and the amount of damage your traps do. And it's nice to see orcs explode in tiny bits or run screaming while they are on fire.  I would like it if there were more different lines of combad shouting. Perhaps in a DLC?
481	1	a	You may think this game looks boring and is pretty one sided but the moment I saw the trailer this definately looked fun. And then I won the game and later bought the DLC on a sale.  This game is hilarious. I'm loving it. You pretty much have to fight against waves and waves of orcs but you get all these brilliant contraptions such as flip tiles, wall arrows, your own archers, floor spikes, explosive barrels so you can build up your defences and hold off against the enemy waves. It gets really challenging when you have a few entry points but if you think well and have a good defence structure, it's a breeze. Endless action, a very funny protagonist and visuals that make you feel like your in a cartoon, it's awesome. 9/10!
2927	1	a	great game for a low price, although animations and graphics are a bit low quaility
4918	0	a	Heyyo,  I bought it because the devs continuously build onto the game and that's cool and all... but it's still sadly broken when it comes to the AI... lots of the AI can be easily defeated by just strafing in a circle and it'll never catch you... so with easy to defeat AI? I can't recommend this game. There's better Swarm games on PC like Hard Reset.
4331	1	a	Ohnestly You Realy want me to buy this im a evil AI i already have it!
6274	0	a	Boring game, got it as Steam gift back in the days, never liked it and surely don't like it now.
3745	1	a	I love broken pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5032	1	a	Ad a campaing
2203	1	a	Do NOT trust metascore ! This game is pure awesomeness ! Spread the word and join !
5834	1	a	game of the year every year
3602	0	a	It feels like I just dropped a 1â¬ coin on a rush sale. I open the game try out the solo and I notice how the dinossaurs movements looks like a plank with robotic legs. I still had some faith and tried joining a multiplayer game but all the servers I could find were either on the other end of the world with over 420 ping or were password protected. I mean, holly mother of dino jesus, even the T-Rex's struggle to move between wee litle dinossaurs.  Oh look, it also has hats, taunts and mutch more fun looking things, surely they are earned by skill. Nope just by money.    So remember kids, just because the trailer and pictures look fun it doesn't mean that is fun.
4053	0	a	Do not buy this game. I bought it when it was under a different name which was Orion Dino Beatdown that game was a buggy mess and so is Orion Dino Horde DO NOT be fooled by it's new name it is still the same piece of trash when it was first released. This game has a small community if you can call it that and the servers are dead the peak is about 60-80 players. The guns feel like cheap knock off BB guns and the AI is just bad then combine that with the dinosaurs getting stuck in objects such as buildings, rocks and mountains that sort of thing. This is by far one of the worst games I have had the horrible misfortune of playing sure the devs seem to be making a vague attempt to make it playable but with it's dead servers and bad gameplay with a dash of microtransactions make this game a slap in the face to the gaming community and hard working devs who produce top quality games. Do not support this product at all.
130	1	a	Wasn't expecting much from this. Wasn't expecting much at all. Then I played the game and slapped myself in the face. Later I looked in the mirror and berated myself for being an idiot. Then I wiped away my self-inflicted tears and went back to my computer with new tears in my eyes... tears of joy brought by this game.
1358	1	a	Entertaining
2464	0	a	Dinosaurs AI is very bad, they only walk in straight lines. Clipping issues with dinosaurs. Graphics could be so much better since this game was release in 2012. The maps are boring, plain open fields of nothingness. The gameplay is clunky and unrealistic. Weapons seem like they don't have any weight and I think bullets travel foward until they hit something. The dinosaur theme itself, not that interesting but I decided to give it a try anyways and wasn't really disapointed cuz i was expecting anything good from the start. Wouldn't even pay 0,01 for it.  (anyone who wants to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this will be talking to the hand cuz i have better thing to do than listen to lil fan boy kids.)
5914	1	a	$1 to get rekt so hard by a dino you break the map 10/10
4629	1	a	You NEED to have this game compatable with mac. all steam games should be for that matter.
216	1	a	If you haven't got this game yet, get it! It's simple but fun, and challenging to get 5 skulls on each level. Truly a great find in 2011 gaming!
2808	1	a	 Guys, buy it now . You won't regret it. Dino Horde , a.k.a. Futurist Killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicules, is a nice fun source. Step 1: Buy the 4-pack Step 2 : Give copies Step 3: Have fun !
2513	1	a	Will not start up... Dont get it yet, wait till they fix this!
384	0	a	Fun idea for a game but i'm finding it to be very glitchy. The opening cinematic freezes after about the fourth word the old man says and the third level refuses to load.
5319	1	a	better fps on desktop than laptop xD 
1342	1	a	This game has it all, its one of them arcade games but with a great story to it. Shank 2 reminds me of 'Commando' which was on miniclip and Shank 2 made it like that, but on steroids. The art is great the becuase it is like a comic feature. The combo system and the combat brilliant, Everything is great. The best Â£3 ive spent, its been a while since ive played a fast pace action video game and this is one i'd reccomend to people. :)
1849	1	a	Classic platformer with good idea. I liked it =)
3717	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
5264	1	a	excellently broken. It a bit of a pain but a blast of fun. If you try not to take it to seriously it can be one of the best games you play. That is if you're with friends.
4674	1	a	It's fun but for a few hours play it doesn't look like a finished game but it's fun and i recommend it if you are looking for a game to kill half an hour with
27	1	a	This was a fun and reasonably easy game to master. The mythic poker system is more of a cross between solitaire and poker. The layout is solitaire, but the building of hands is very much poker. Royal Flush has the most value at 50 attack points. I like the way your runespells charge by both dealing damage and receiving it from enemy attacks. The story was reasonably engaging for what it was, and they left room for DLC or a sequel. All in all, a good way to kill 8 or 10 hours. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7 for fun, but an 8 or 9 as far as games you can play to kill time whne you are bored. Online play would be a natural evolution for this game. I hope they are considering the development of PvP matches.
697	1	a	Great little game of Tower Defense against countless Orcs where you are right in the action 3d person. Just replace the word Tower with Trap...
1549	1	a	EA sucks! They make you sign in to Origin, twice! Then they make you 'activate' the game with a CD key, twice! The menu sustem is also crap. It's inconsistent and clumsy. Please EA, just die already.  That said, the game is pretty awesome. I had a hard time putting it down and played for 3 hours in the first sitting. Graphics are good and control is decent, at least with a controller. I love all the little sounds the alien makes. If you're a fan on minions, you'll love this little guy.
4119	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
2861	1	a	Wow, simply fantastic. I've persoanlly been searching for a good Dinosaur game for a while now, and all have been sub-par. All until now, that is. This game is the most exhilirating, most intense, hardcore dinosaur game I have ever played. I would a hundred dollars for this game, but this game is a fraction of the price, making it a must buy, 11/10 would reccomend
5371	0	a	It's pretty bad, unfinished and full of microtransactions (not pay to win, only cosmetic). Overall....it's free and I still didn't my money's worth.
4062	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ tier game, how do you â¥â¥â¥â¥ up dinosaurs 0/10 would rather fist my own â¥â¥â¥
6142	0	a	The graphics are out dated, most of the servers don't work. Lack of support for new players make the game unbalanced. Don't waste your money
2950	1	a	When I first got it, I thought this game was crap. Then I realised that my computer was crap. The game was too pretty for me and my computer wasn't happy about it. So really, that's good. But survival wasn't doing it for me. AI weren't all that great, and I didn't know what to do. Then I played rampage mode. DANG. I'm a human. And some guy playing just ate me. LOL. I mix things up and play as a Spinosaurus. And I ate people. And it was AWESOME. Then I finally got somewhere in survival and I found a tank. And shot a Stegosaurus. And a T-Rex. And I wrecked dino-face. So glorious. Bought a 4-pack, and I'm looking forward to eating my friends while they try to kill me with puny guns. Not a great game, but it's great fun. I'd recommend this for $15 dollars. All the way. IT GOT BETTER.
6132	1	a	Game is a lot of fun, but the only problem I had seem to have was that there was lag when having a second player join. It wasn't impossible to play, but it was a mild annoyance.
3694	1	a	Best. Full with actions. Recommended.
6467	1	a	I bought this game when it came out. For $6 is was good. For $1 its even better!
4671	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
5908	1	a	Think about this, this game is cheaper than a bar of chocolate. A bar of chocolate is satisfying but only for a short while as after you eat it, it's gone. Orion: Prelude on the other hand is a game meaning that it has a practically infinite amount of usage, and if shooting dinosaurs in the face is not satisfying to you then I don't know what is.
3872	1	a	I don't own the game but I can write a rewiev. So I think it's a cool game and I give it a good rewiev.
5038	1	a	Gud game. Trailer sold me on game. Best 2k19. Worse than ark. Buy ark instead.
4532	0	a	Orion: Prelude a game where you get to protect power generators and shoot dinos! Sounds fun right? Tried it out, guns sounded generic, abilities seemed a bit uninspired. Dino models looked great, gun models looked pretty decent, but the game crashed. Combine that effect with a lack of single player story and well... you get to shoot dinos right? Unfortunately the games not for me, you don't get to build anything permenanet, design any dinos, and from asking around all the matches, waves, and spawning rates are typically the same. I am not able to recommend this game.
324	1	a	Lay traps and keep killing orcs and their allies, bit like a zombie game except more fun!!!!!
2308	1	a	Counter strike with Dinosaurs, do you really need anything more? You even get classes to buff yourself up so you can HACK INTO DINO ANKLES WITH A KNIFE
1295	1	a	Great 2D beat-em-up  PROS +Big Arsenal +Great Battle System +Nice artstyle +Big amount of skins +Nice storyline +Survival Mode with coop  CONS -NO coop for campaign -A bit short  Nice and enjoyable beat-em-up=)
701	1	a	Awesome...a proper blaster with some turret style tactics and humour thats reminiscent of Evil dead' Ash...recommend it 100%
4989	0	a	BLAM THIS PEICE OF SH!T
4964	1	a	mlg seal of approval
1344	1	a	Nice beat 'em up sequel 'directed' by Quentin Tarantino :)
1474	1	a	worth the price and its a lot of fun both in co-op and singleplayer, gameplay is better but i miss the co-op story from the first game and the way that you had to find difrent aproche for each boss, now its kick them till they dead and it makes them boring and basicly they all feel the same, in the first game you died a lot till you find the way to kill the boss but when you did you can kill the boss fast, and feel smart, the same was in coop story
4725	0	a	ripped my money
2605	0	a	Warning , there is NO invert options on this, i have waisted cash and space on this . if you do find options for this pls let me know as i cant find invert anywhere. good looking game but built in the stone age it seems:( 
1877	1	a	Easy to play, Simple but beautifully rendered graphics. Plot is a little weak but hey, whaddy'a expect from a game which costs less than $10? 8/10

3659	1	a	this is the best game for such money ! some times big ping but still nice , so i can recomend it if you are bored or wanna kill some time!!!
3010	1	a	Just spent two hours on Survival, got a consistent feel going. That.Was.The.Most.Amazing.Game.I.Have.Ever.Played. This game is INSANE. The dev team is out of their minds to make it $1. Buy it now, buy 4 packs like I have, sell it when it gets popular for like $5 lower, make a profit, have fun with friends, heck, the experience is yours to make. Enjoy.
3060	1	a	So I watched like one episode of Sword Art Online 2 and if anyone knows me they know I like sniper rifles as much as I like swords, so I was reading this synopsis of one episode and I got really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that they imply the top sniper in an entire extremely competitive gun-based game was less skilled than some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that shows up with a sword, and then my friend tells me about how Kirito is using a sword in a gun game and how that was the class that was apparently treated as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and awful and he's automatically the best at it.  So it made me think of this game because one time I jumped out of an aircraft with a lightsaber and took out a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing t-rex in one hit with it.  *****. Best $1.00 I ever spent on a game.
3655	1	a	its like call of duty if you replace the word call with dinosaur the word of with killing and duty with simulator. 10/10 IGN
1567	0	a	A simple but fun tower defense. Till level 4. Level 4 does not load, the game crashes. Do not buy this game. It's not worth whatever they are charging.
3532	1	a	When it first came out, it was totally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Now, they actually polished it real well and it is pretty fun. Great team game.
2670	1	a	0.99 is a steal for this game. Fun and more fun. Lovin it.
3489	1	a	This game is like halo and dinosaurs combined into one! I would reccomend it to anyone even if your new to the game. 
6152	1	a	A surprisingly fun title with more than what you bargained for.
5352	1	a	CoD Ghosts:  - Kids on multiplayer - Spamming on Voice Chat  - Very High Price - Unrealistic Gameplay while game takes place in this universe - Crappy graphics  This game: + Great multiplayer experience  + No voice chat for spamming + 0.79 cents + Fantasy FPS with an alternate universe + Still better graphics than CoD. 
1051	1	a	Not since Lemmings has a game so seamlessly mixed engaging mechanics, humor, cuteness, and gleeful cruelty.â 90/100 â PCGamer   I AGREE!
2858	1	a	I'm surprised. This is actually a fun game. Is it a KF replacement? No, but it will give you hours of fun. And you can't beat the price.
1680	1	a	Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it! The level design is consistently 'pretty good,' with occasional memorable moments.  You play as a BEEP robot, exploring a system to collect antimatter. Gameplay consists of mostly platforming puzzles utilizing moving, jumping, shooting, and, more often than not, the Zero Point Energy Field manipulator (read: gravity gun) which you control with the right mouse button. The game takes place in an unnamed star system with three planets. Each of the two hemispheres on each planet has its own environments, music, and introduces one or two game mechanics that for the most part are used exclusively for that hemisphere. Each hemisphere has 4 levels, which each have 3 anti-matter nuggets to find, as well as a bonus fourth one which is rewarded upon collecting ~20 smaller pellets scattered around the level. This leaves 96 antimatter parts to collect. In order to unlock the next hemisphere, you must find a minimum amount of antimatter nuggets in the previous levels, as well as getting to the end of all the previous levels.  While this game is certainly charming, it's not without its flaws. It is very possible to use the antimatter to grab an item and use it to propel yourself upwards before grabbing it and using it again, and, if you're good enough at it, can be used to get over almost any obstacle. While the game never requires you to do this, it is tempting to do it to get just a  little  more air to climb a wall. On quite a few walls, it is possible to simply drive straight up them by moving towards them, as one of BEEP's wheels seems to clip into the wall. The difficulty curve is somewhat predictable up until the last planet, where both hemispheres present environmental hazards that make the game much more difficult (though not frustratingly so). Completing levels honestly felt a little unrewarding, and I was consistently able to 100% complete levels my first time visiting, never having to backtrack. Additionally,  there is no reward for collecting all 96 nuggets of anti-matter . This may be an issue for people who invest more time to collect everything. I managed to beat the game and collect everything without backtracking in under 4 hours.  As a snobby musician, I thought the music was pretty forgettable, However, it had themes that appeared multiple times in the game, which is always interesting to discover, and the music never feels out of place. The art style feels very much like that of a decent flash game, using basic shapes and characters with cartoony eyes and solid colors. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it feels hastily done to me.  At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.49. I can definitely recommend it at that price, at least. It's a cute little game, but don't expect hardcore gameplay or mindblowing game design.
3933	1	a	Love this game lots of fun!

5127	1	a	A co-op shooter where you fight waves of Dinosaurs. Very similar to Killing Floor. Would murder waves of extinct animals again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v44GiUhVAbw

4291	0	a	Not worth even 99 cents !!!  Don't buy IT !!!   Too booring!!!
2454	0	a	Don't trust the minimum system specs listed. My system meets all of them and even with all settings dropped to lowest, I only get around 3 FPS, making the game completely unplayable. This comes despite marginal polygon counts and no exceptionally heavy eye candy that I could see. There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game. Audio stuttering on SFX is one thing, but this was BGM stuttering, completely ruining immersion. Needs heavy work before I'd call it a success of any sort.
6465	0	a	Crashes on startup.

1505	0	a	This game was not enjoyable at all and I felt like I was smacking my head againist a wall because of my machosistic desire to finish games. The puzzles weren't awful and the atmosphere was okay but stuff seemed off and when enemies spotted you it seemed at times unfair and then they randomly swear at you for no apparent reason.   Not something I'd recommend to anyone.... =(
1541	1	a	This game is insanely fun! The little guy reminds me of Stitch of Lilo and Stitch only he has no qualms with warping into a person and reinacting the chest popper scen from Alien. This game is a great mix of puzzles, stealth, and little bits of awesome that make me squee.
295	1	a	Fun. Try out OMD 2.
1268	1	a	I received this game as a gift and after playing it for a while I'll have to buy my friend a drink, tap him on his back and forgive him his foolishnes.
3285	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
5565	0	a	The game's a shoddy Halo clone with goofy dinosaurs. Didn't have fun with it when it was new, but your mileage may vary.  However, the developers of this game are shady hacks. They've done multiple re-releases of this game in the past, in order to bury the earlier iteration's extremely poor reviews. They dropped the price to a hilariously low 99 cents [or less during a sale] so they can take advantage of people thinking, 'This game's super cheap, I won't lose anything if I buy it'. They've stolen assets from other developers on several occasions, such as an armory model from the game Natural Selection 2.  As further proof of this second point, another identical halo/dino game by them simply titled 'Orion' was recently removed by Steam as of the writing of this. They ripped a *fictional* sci fi gun model [a very different scenario than if they stole a modern-day, real gun] out of one of Activision's newer CoD games and shamelessly used it as their own. I don't normally side with Activision, but I really wish more big companies could strong-arm these scumbags out of the industry.  Having paid the original price for this game when it originally released as Orion: Dino Beatdown, which was 20 bucks, and of course long before the days of steam refunds, my regret for buying this piece of garbage will never cease haunting me.  Don't buy this. Don't support these devs with this game or any other game they make. Let it all die.
2823	1	a	It's almost so bad it's good. I wouldn't recommend for solo play, fun with a friend. 10/10 would get stuck in a rock again.
6065	0	a	Absolutely horrible, I first had to trek 1 kilometer JUST TO GET TO THE FIGHT, and then the generator you were supposed to defend was out in the middle of a field IN FRONT OF THE FORT, as opposed to in the fort, where any sensible architect would have put it, and then when the dinos finally did begin appearing out of nowhere, I simply ran into them until they died on a tiny gravcycle, even the 'boss' was killed by a few hits with the completely undamaged gravcycle.
3113	1	a	This game seems to have a pretty bad reputation but after playing it for a few hours it is genuinely entertaining. It is not, however, a polished product by any means. It has plenty of flaws and at times feels like a conversion mod for another game. Overall it's definitely fun and worth $1 though.
1949	1	a	I haven't actually played this game but it looks nice
4786	0	a	Your bullets teleport to the target, this game sucks.
5243	0	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAID FOR THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ NOW ITS FREE TO PLAY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS STEAM WHAT ARE YOU DOING
2859	1	a	ok so i bought this game for 99 cents when it was on sale and i will admit it was probably the best 99 cents i have spent recently. the game is pretty fun i mean there are a few small things that i think could be a little better but overal the game is a great time killer and it has the potencial to be really fun if you have a good group of friends to play with. i personally wouldnt spend full price on it though even though it is fun there isnt much content its just another multi-player shooter. but next time it is on a steam sale i say get it for sure
1209	1	a	Simple gameplay but very enjoyable and replayable.
375	0	a	It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2
6005	1	a	Beats playing Dino D-Day Worth getting :D DX11 Support, Unreal Engine, You can ride on a T-REX and destory humans together, you can drive bikes/cars etc, totally epic game well worth checking out.
3214	1	a	It might have been complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ once, but after trying it, it isn't too bad for such a cheap game. Think Killing Floor, except really, really stupid and with giant enemies and vehicles. The hate for this game is a little bit ridiculous at this point, so I suggest getting it once it's on sale and just have some fun. With a more polished sequel with more content and variety it might actually be a great game... Hell, give me a sequel with climbing mechanics from Dragon's Dogma and we have a classic.
2514	1	a	One time, my girlfriend had this dream that me, her, and all of my friends were riding this huge pterodactyl. We were armed with assault rifles and flame throwers, soaring through the sky. There were many raptors and lions beneath us, which we were mowing down by the ton with our guns.
47	1	a	Puzzle Quest fans need look no further for their next addiction.
281	1	a	I liked Dungeon Defenders a lot, but Orcs Must Die is even better. There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!  The game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.  And since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game. Highly recommended as i guarantee you countless hours of insane fun!
6462	1	a	IT IS VERY COOL   
3555	1	a	Seriously, do not be fooled this game can provide hours of fun alone or with friends! The dinosaurs are bad â¥â¥â¥ and the gameplay is way better than you would expect. Buy it on sale though 15 bucks is a rip off. I got it for like 3 or 4 dollars.
26	1	a	Love this card game, use poker hands to defeat your enemys, with plenty of spell cards and allies to aid you when things get difficult. Most enemies are easy to start off and you think its a walk in the park but it soon cranks up the difficulty later on and you have to really think ahead and put good hands together to win. If you like card games then this is worth a shot.
906	1	a	great game, just smash zombies in many ways, 10 out of 10 :)
4315	1	a	its a nice game, but before you ask no i wouldent pay the 15 bucks for this game but 99 cents yeah its fun.
1900	1	a	It's like mario, instead as a robot (with an antigravity gun, and machine gun). Very enjoyable game, feels great to complete a level. Pros: -cool soundtrack -interesting graphics -price -trading cards  Cons: -no achievments :((  Should you buy this game? Yes. A very enjoyable $5 game to keep you entertained for hours. 10/10 would play robot mario again
2237	0	a	too many glitches and stuff they need to fix them
2341	1	a	One of the best games I have out of my almost 100 game steam library! The Metacritic is wrong. Other than connection problems, the game has no problems. It gets better with time. The Devs really deserve for this game to be played. GET THIS GAME ALREADY!
4538	1	a	It's a fun game, simple, slightly stupid, and way more fun than I had expected from it. It's worth the 15 dollars you can usually get it for, but I've seen it on sale for 93% off a few times, and i'd recommend you stock up on a few copies for you and your friends any time it's on sale.
1167	1	a	Forget the later OMD games, this is the one you want.
4396	1	a	LOVE IT
5386	0	a	bad graphics, terrible audio and sounds wich give you a headache, badly optimized, massive frame drops, bad animations, bad models, etc, i dont recommend this game at all, the only good thing about this game is the ragdoll physics on the dinosaurs, nuff said
425	1	a	If you have the money buy the game its amazing. Lots of games time trying to get a 5  skull rating on evrey level. If not at least try the demo for it.
5538	1	a	pteroerdactelyeyl scooped me up whil i was dancing 4 da ladiez  
1127	1	a	Amazing!! I played this on my friends PC and bought it without a single thought!! lol
1315	1	a	A great sequel to the first Shank installment, which is also pretty good. I love the visual style and the animations in this game, its definitely one of most entertaining platformers i've played.  The length of the game is also good, controls are solid and easy to learn. Survival mode can be really fun, too bad i could not find anyone to play online. I should have played this back when it was released, but oh well. :/  The only thing this game lacks is online and local co-op for the Campaign, which could have been a great addition to the game, but still. I highly recommend both games if you still haven't played it. The first Shank did have local co-op, i don't know why they removed it.  Also, try Mark Of The Ninja, another epic platformer from the same creators  Score: 8,5/10
146	1	a	 Orcs must die  belongs to a genre that is obviously meant to be have repetitiveness, but in a good way so no reason to explain that . You have to stop horde of ogres from getting into some kind of orb that powers you and the valley. Use traps, weapons, guardians and powers to stop the horde. It may sound boring but trust me you'll love it. It has a bit of story that continues on OMD 2! so it is recommended to buy both on bundle. + Play as you wish. First 2 levels are meant to teach you but after that kill them however you want. + Plenty of creative environment kills available + Increasing difficulty doesn't mean the health bar will just increase. Instead, a lot of varied types of ogres come that requires good knowledge of weapons that you'll pick before starting the stage + Creative weapons + Funny + Really cheap on sale  -Just when you think you have the grip, the game ends -No boss ending, kill the last horde and the game will just end after a cutscene  ~Stages are not sorted according to difficulty well. There are difficult levels and some dead easy levels right after that. But maybe thats how they want it to be.   Overall I give this game 7/10 Nick Cage and a big heeeeehaw!  
5359	1	a	Really cool game, loved the gameplay. It would help to have a tutorial system that explains the controls while using a controller
4939	1	a	an combo of starwars, dirsic park, tf2 and lots of fun
2255	1	a	You get Halo, CoD, and one heck of a FPS for .99 cents
5829	1	a	- Fun for a buck.   -The opposite of how it feels to buy a slice of gas station pizza in the middle of nowhere because you're hungry, and as you eat it, begin thinking clearer about what just happened; you went and paid 3.50 for a slice of pizza (which was the only slice left in the warming display) that you would normally not eat unless one of your buddies gave you 5 or 10 bucks on a dare, because the thing is so dried up and stiff you could more feasibly use it as a shield for being attacked by an aggressive cat with KHAJI'IT-sharp claws rather than consider it a source of nutrition.   Don't let my play time fool you, I really had fun after the whole Prelude update, I could see more life being breathed into the game. It seems the devs are very active, the community has a pulse, for my brief experience the rounds played at a fun pace. Likely, I'll play much more one day but I can only focus on a limited amount of games at any given time, and I'm more of a single-player, grind to get achievements, story mode gamer.   It's a freickieng dollar when it's full price. Just get it because, you can pay 10-20 times that amount for a game you will NOT EVER enjoy as much as this game!   Or, don't get it yet- It's going to be a dollar (or less), forever!   
2989	1	a	To be honest, the game is far from being perfect. The animations are bad, the bots are dumb and for the first hour in game, you don't really know what's happening. BUT the overall concept is really, really cool. It's just like some guys were sitting together over some beer and then someone said: 'I'd really like to play a game right now, where I can punch some T-Rex on his nose!' And then the second guy said: 'Yeah, and where I can fly a jetpack while shooting rockets!' And the third guy just shouted 'LIGHTSABRES!'. Then they finished their beer and started working. For all of us. Because we all secretly wanted this game.  Even though the result doesn't look as great as they probably hoped, the game works. And goddammit it's so much fun. Buy it. And buy it for your friends too, so you can punch T-Rexes and run over raptors in beach buggies together. It costs less than a beer.
5724	0	a	.
1136	1	a	The most fun i've had playing a game in ages. Great for pick-up-and-play after a long day by just chunking orcs to bits, but the nightmare mode and leaderboard rankings actually require a lot of strategy and forethought. Have played it for countless hours (well, ok... 33 in two weeks) and have gotten 5 skulls on every level on NIGHTMARE... and that this is from a guy who can't even be bothered togo back and finish the last level in MGS4 because it would require fiddling around behind the TV to plug it in which should tell you all about how addictive and enjoyable it is.
4360	1	a	Otion: Prelude is funny game, much better now then it started!  + Various weapons; Vehicles; Perks; Habilities; Chalenging; Leveling; Weather changing;  - Optimization; Maps Quantity; A.I; A lot of bugs; Physics.  Score: 7/10 
4756	0	a	I haven't played this a lot yet, but so far the experience has been quite terrible. When I play with others the game seem to randomly lag like crazy. Also, monster animations are a travesty. Completely boring combat. I think it's safe to skip this one.  2014.10.02: I've noticed the game has changed its name yet again. It's at least the third time it has changed name. Pathetic.
6148	1	a	I cant believe this game is only for $1. If you are too stingy to pay $1 for quality, then go sit in the corner.  (personally i got one of the free copies)  First of all, you are paying for bare minimum quality you would expect from a $1 game. However, the quality you get is much better then that of most $20-30 games. Not to mention all the different game modes, equipment, enemies and customization.  Sound/picture quality: 7/10 (few graphical/camera issues that need to be addressed. Luckily they do not affect the core game)  Gameplay: 8/10 (its just generally all around fun. What more could you want from shooting dinosaurs)  Multiplayer: 10/10 (Had no issues with multiplayer. Its just one of those games thats 10x as fun with friends)  Highly recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it. Its only gonna continue to get larger with steam workshop content flooding in. (PS: some game modes allow playing as dinosaurs)

2184	0	a	this game was a dollar and I still feel like it wasn't worth it  that's like an entire twix bar man
5909	1	a	I bought this game for my friends and I as a joke yet it turned into most of our favorites. Great graphics, controls, and gameplay made this an amazing buy for a dollar. It's sad that there aren't that many players because this game deservers a lot more players than it haves.
2891	1	a	donno if its just me but its super laggy, can't see the dinos or anything else. I also played it on a friends PC and was great   9/10 great game
570	1	a	Started playing because I got this as a gift from my friend. CAN'T STAHP PLAING. I THINK I HAVE ORC-BOLA PLES SOMEONE HELP ME! (This game is amazing, in a shortened version of those last couple of sentences. lol, good game, guys!)
5934	1	a	This game can be a bit hectic if you thrust into it right away but it's fun, very fun!
4293	0	a	ThatÂ´s the first game I bought in the new steam interface....couldnÂ´t be sorrier. How come 73% of more than 10,000 user could possible recommend this crap!? One visit at metacr... site and all I see are terrible reviews by the critics and a very low metascore, but I had already bought it.  Difficult to play, need to put all video quality on low and still bugging. On other computer with more power the game was a little better but the gameplay is not ok, too messy and confused. 
1901	0	a	not worth it!!!
3502	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least.  Personal Rating: 2.5/5
6271	1	a	Fun,runs smooth and its only 99 cents.
1490	1	a	It definitely is a fun little game, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a simple adventure type game. I enjoyed spending time on it. You play as a little critter that can warp through thin doors and such. You can make people explode if you warp into a human so thats neat too :o
3965	0	a	Though fun, the game falls horribly short as the dinosaur. They feel unpowered, squishy, and mostly target practice. Where this is good playing as a human in survival or even in versus; It leaves much to be desired as the supposedly powerful beasts. As the smaller dino's, you're so soft that you can rarely take more than one quick shot. The larger ones seem so clumsy and slow that it's nearly impossible to hit the humans. It could really do with some rebalancing of the team/species-based combat. The solo play is fun, and playing humans v. humans is also enjoyable, if not reminescent of another scifi shooter. If you wanted to play this game simply to be a titan, squishing puny humans and eating them up, this is not for you. If you wanted a good online shooter where you can switch targets between walking fossils and other sacks of meat; then you've come to the right place.
4553	1	a	Killing dinosaurs was never this easy!
5181	0	a	Good mechanics and graphics for a 1 dollar game, but too unpolished and unplayable.
4215	0	a	this game is absolutely terrible. i bought a 4 pack when it first came out. (at full price) they its had its name changed twice since then. terrible terrible game. dont believe my hours played either. the game didnt close and kept running in the background. save youself some money and shoot yourself in the leg for the same experience.
2047	1	a	Great little game with brilliant color and runs so smooth on mid-end PCs. Fun to play and smart use of abilities in the objects found in the environment; a bit of simple tweaking can be done to get you over a seemingly unscalable wall just by using the bodies of defeated robots and the random mass blocks that work even better, especially if you remember to throw them ahead of the screen to use again for the next obstacle. Can't wait for the sequel.

1058	1	a	Excellent game, one of the best trap / tower defense type games i've yet to play.  The graphics are good for what it is, the game runs very smooth and is nice and fast paced. Excellent game, certainly worth looking at.
4827	0	a	it doesn't seem to be running properly. i'm not sure if that's because of my system or an internet related problem, but its too frustrating to hold my attention.
5854	1	a	the soundtrack i9n this game is so awesome!!! the prehistoric mode is awesome too i like to put the dinos health and damage to 25%:p
3842	1	a	I have played the first beta of the game ... it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ . But i have to admit that this has been the best transformation of a game i have ever witnessed
4474	1	a	The best 79 cents I've ever spent.
5126	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
1261	1	a	Orcs Must Die!, another game I got AFTER the 2nd in the series.  Guess what?  I'm doing it wrong.  But anyway, great story with amazing voice acting, especially the effects of the sorceresse's voice. Another Gr8 r8 8/8 m8. Thx! :D

851	1	a	I...I think I just realized I don't like tower defense games after all the ones I've tried. I can recognize this as being a well made hybrid of that and a third-person shooter, and there are definitely things about it I can appreciate, but even after trying it twice a couple years apart, I've bounced off it both times. Thanks, Orcs Must Die. You seem like a good game...for someone else.

3680	1	a	One of the best dollars I ever spent on a video game. Take on waves of Dinosaurs in Survival modes, using a wide array of weapons, skills, vehicles and classes. Customize your character with hats, capes, Armour colors and more if you are willing to spend an extra couple bucks. If you a PVP player their is a wide variety of Deathmatch and objective modes as well although this game really shines in its survival mode in my opinion. Something adrenaline rushing about fighting against waves of Raptors, Pteradactyls, Stego, Rex's, Spinosaurs and a lot more.  Game Showcase-    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5-0QSalIis

4709	1	a	This game is an amazing exmple of great developers. A few years ago, this ame was everywhere on steam with the reputaton of one of the worst games to be made and sold on steam. However, the developers instead of doing what a lot of game designers do (abandon their game), they stuck with it. They knew they had an interesting idea and in there, they just neede to improve upon the game, and they did. This game is now one of the most stupid fun games I have. I the developer's new saying, Games cannot fail, only developers can.
3651	1	a	Great game to burn an hour or spend all day on when you need to! Has great graphics and concept. Cheap and easy to learn
4466	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
4627	0	a	Worst game i've ever bought
4876	1	a	one of the only games where im better than everyone else one of the only games that cost 99 cents and i ask why a game where you can get chewed up though a wall  34/16
1927	1	a	Great game i love how when you order pizza and they deliver you frosted flakes ceral, its just well made game, you guys took your time in fixing my car and making me cookies, you're such a doll, this beats mw2 and csgo put together and a dash of mtn dew. thanks and have a wonderful doritos
2068	1	a	For this price it provides a lot of fun. It can also get a bit tricky at times, especially at the end, but for the most part it just feels too easy. What I really don't like, is the lack of options in the main menu. There is also no way to rebind your controls or change resolution, but overall it is still a good game.
319	1	a	Addictive.
3827	0	a	Unless you are mentally ill, and or a masochist, who like to torture yourself, I cannot recommend this game. Its just a reskin of the older game, Orion: Dino Horde, still has the same bugs, broken mechanics and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ balance.
5608	0	a	Why support lazy developers who have show a penchant for stifling user criticism...  Spend the .99 on a McDonald's coffee and enjoy it.
3967	1	a	AWESOME but slow load speed and shooting reaction 
3538	0	a	âââââ   Pure trash. That's why it went down in price to a mere .49 cents. But go ahead purchase it. Because some of you will think 'It can't be that bad is it?'.
2511	1	a	For however â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheap it is, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hilarious to play with friends. It also looks REALLY good.
1980	1	a	its a great game do play when you are bored cause its really funny and makes you flexible
439	1	a	This is a good game to kill time with. Classic tower defense type of game.
2367	0	a	This game is terrible. First 2 minutes sure that was fun but after that its terrible. The reviews below are misleading the trailer is nothing like the game, this is just Halo with Dinosaurs. The game is full of microtransactions and full of glitches. Do not trust the trailers or reviews that are postitive the developers are lying and this is not even worth putting on your Hard Drive even if its free. DO NOT be pulled into the heap of trash which is Orion: Dino Horde
656	1	a	Tower defense with humor and an attitude. The music keeps pumping, orcs keep coming and you have a growing arsenal of traps and weapons to keep them at bay. Lots of fun!
1343	1	a	If you ever played the first Shank, then you pretty much know what to expect from this sequel. It improves on some of the frustrations the first one had, but unfortunately not all. First of all there are more weapons included in this Shank adventure, which makes killing more fun overall.  Second, they have included counter-attacks, meaning you can press a button when a red exclamation mark appears above your enemy. It looks cool in motion and works really well.  On to the stuff that isn't quite alright... it's short. But I don't see that as a downside. When you finish the game (about 4 hours) you've probably seen it all. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, thankfully. And then we have the difficulty. One moment it's easy as I-don't-know-what, and the other moment (which can be seconds later) the difficulty ramps up making it practically unplayable.  It's a good game nonetheless, and if you love beat 'em ups you'll love this one as well, I'm sure.  [Rating: 73/100]
3890	1	a	This game is a fun little title where you fight horde after horde of zombi-, I mean dinosaurs. Even though the game is pretty glitchy I still think that this game is a fun FPS to play with friends. One thing I disliked however is that there is an ingame store that requires real money to make any purchases, which is a shame. Seeing as how the game is on sale now, I would suggest buying it.
1219	1	a	Funny as all living hell.
2102	1	a	I got ripped off, I spent 1 dollar to buy it, now it's free.
1193	1	a	Great game - exactly what I had hoped Dungeon Defeneders would be. Just the right weight of game for me - not too heavy/long, but not so light/simple that it isn't fun.
693	1	a	Great game for the price. I even picked it up on sale. It will give you a lot of game play IF you want to get all five skulls and the achievements. Get ready to be frustratied (unless you play on easy) However, the challenge is part of the game. Remember this is a short game but it's worth the low price.
5431	0	a	I can't run it in offline mode steam!!!!
5052	1	a	cool and good co-op 
6342	1	a	11/10 would kill my team again driving off a cliff
310	1	a	A Great Singlepayer Third Person Tower Defence, If that's what you're looking for and If that's not what you want then buy it anyways
2856	1	a	I haven't play'd this game since some of the most, most recent updates as an fyi. When my friends ask me about this game i tell them that this game is buggy and if you come into the game as a try hard wanting to beat it on the hardest difficulty this isn't the game for you. however if you come in with friends and just F around you will have one of the funest experiences of your life.  10/10 Best Simulator for Driving off cliffs in a Truck full of teammates
2737	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Do you like peacefull, non FPS games? Do you like usefull teamates? Do you like paying for good games? Did you answered NO to most of the questions? Then you will love this game
2500	1	a	Ignore the metascore. I believe it has something to do with a previous iteration of the game. This game is great fun with friends. There are plenty of different game modes and most of the bugs seem to be ironed out. The development team are also constantly adding new features and game modes.  If you're looking for some entertaining co-op or versus action with friends then I highly recommend it.
3649	0	a	Not so good of a game, badly-optimized too. Developer stole assets from other companies, lie/threaten legal action to the community to protect themselves, and get away by removing those content when caught, excuses attached.
1140	1	a	Great game
672	1	a	This is just dirty, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed fun. Gotta think, gotta react, and most of all - gotta stay calm. Definitely worth the lucre.
3186	1	a	'Optimus Prime in the teens fights buggy dinosaurs.GOTY!' - Gamestop 'Like Halo with guns!' - IGN 'IT'S 1$!!! I LOVE STEAM!!!' - 12 yo boy
2010	1	a	The realism in this game is out of this world
1916	0	a	F**K This Game. Only Buy On Sale For Trading Cards And Sell Them!
5422	1	a	Best dollar I've spent on steam.
4863	1	a	Game is actually really good. Would buy again.
4817	0	a	Definately no similarity to the Carnivores series of dino hunting games. Might be fun with friends, but when playing solo, it's nearly impossible to survive more than a few waves of dinosaurs. I hope developers create something similar to the old Carnivores games...this definately isn't even close to a real dino hunting game.
5172	0	a	I want my dollar back! Enough said.
288	1	a	One of the most fun tower defense games I have ever played! The controls are perfect, the humor is spot on, the character animations reek with personality, there's lots of replayability if you want to get the highest scores and ratings per stage, the story is hilarious and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! What also makes a great tower defense game is freedom in how you accomplish your goal. This game definitely leaves room for success via various strategies. Definitely a must buy!
4838	1	a	I find this game extremely fun. Not sure why, but it is. Maybe it's because it looks like L4D2. I mean, the objective is to fight with the horde. Back to topic, i recommend it, you'll find a lot of hours of fun here. I like the vehicles a lot. I found only one little problem in steering some of them, but it's not something upsetting. The idea is so cool. I wait for new upgrades.
6473	1	a	Probably the best videogame in existence. There are costumes, and Sandwich hats, and Dinosaur Killing.  So much Dinosaur Killing.  10/10.  Logical Conclusion to Gaming.
1197	1	a	This is awesome! Only thing it is lacking, whish is a major thing.. is cooperative gameplay!
2900	1	a	It made me â¥â¥â¥â¥ upon myself
2961	1	a	dinosaurs, lasers, guns, futureristic,lightsabers,jeeps,hover vehicles,and drones what more of a cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥ can u ask for  1000/1000-MGN would play again
1464	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
80	1	a	Card game rpg? Why not... fun for a little while unless youâre into cards, then you'll have a blast methinks. There should be an 'iffy' button for 'Do you recommend this game?'. More positive than negative so I'll say Yes.
6426	1	a	LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
5268	1	a	This is amazing....
4489	0	a	The third release of Orion: Dino Beatdown is no better than the first, they fixed some issues but a lot of technical stuff is still broken, and even for a dollar, a tenth of what i paid, I don't beleive thisis worth your time. There are better free games on steam.
3118	1	a	This game is awesome! That is the truth. There is a bit of jank to it though, but the developers appear to be actively updating it and ironing it out. What is already here is awesome. Like how Fall Out New Vegas was awesome, jank and all. The game is a blast to play. All games types have a real sense of progression to them and a rewarding upgrade/weapon/vehicle system to keep it changing as you go. The augmentations system alone gives you the ability to customize your game on every life or level if you want. This game is great. Get eaten buy a T Rex or the other one at least once. You gotta do it. 10 outta 10.
783	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very enjoyable mix of the tower defense and third-person shooter genres with plenty of comedy mixed in. The objective of the game is to place traps in order to prevent waves of orcs from making their way through to your world. As you progress, you unlock more traps which you can also upgrade. Furthermore, you can supplement your traps by attacking the orcs directly.  I highly recommend this game. The gameplay and comedy are highly enjoyable. For those looking for a co-op experience, you'll want to check out Orcs Must Die! 2. Which as a bonus includes levels from Orcs Must Die! in addition to it's own, new, levels.
440	1	a	The voice actor of the War Mage Apprentice (the player) in this game is Robert McCollum! He voice-acted Wataru Akiyama from the anime Initial D!  Oh My gosh this game is cool, one of the best tower defence games I've ever played, or even enjoyed for that matter.
504	1	a	Very easy to get into. EXTREAMLY FUN! As casual games go there few that can offer you this much fun. Killing the hordes of orcs and vile creatures that storm your castles never gets old. The maps gets very interesting as you move truought the campaign and your unlocked traps and upgrades are persistent so you can use them all the time anywhere.  ORCS MUST DIE  MUST BUY!
2452	1	a	Yeah, I have been playing games for years and years, and back in the day, games were fun, games were simple, and most of all games were FUN, specially with friends,this game while simple in its premise, has a lot of heart is fast paced, and is loads of fun, sure the meta critic is low, but that was its previous incarnation, not this one, this is a great article on the game check it out:   http://www.dsogaming.com/editorial/orion-dino-horde-controversy-let-the-battle-begin/   Besides what have you got to loose for a few dollars? this game gives you more bang for your buck than some AAA titles that I own, and even tho It might not be the most polished or graphically amazing game out there, it delivers, and brings home the pizza!  so dont hesitate, you will have fun, you will be surprised at the sheer madness of running around from killer dinos, and then jumping in a jetbike making a last second save, the gameplay has lots of emergent moments of pure madness, and in that you can see that the folks that made it has a vision, and above all know how to make a fun game.  Play it, you will be surprised! oh and it has a 5 star community you cant go wrong!  
1557	0	a	A serviceable effort for the consumption of genre fans that are satiated with a competent Tower Defense game. For the rest I suggest you check out Defense Grid, Orcs must Die or another exemplary title in the field since this game doesn't really stray from the tried and true formula.  It bored me.
4618	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME
3731	0	a	couldn't join matchmaking and single player was not fun or challenging. would not recomend buying
389	0	a	This game is all about killing orcs with traps, no big deal.
1940	0	a	  This game is horrible. Please for the love of god and your wallet, do not get this game.
68	0	a	Play Solitaire instead.
5244	0	a	Itisbad but fun sometimes
2534	1	a	A game that has everything you've ever needed: Guns, dinosaurs and pizza.
4539	0	a	Game is ok if you are borring. This culd be Free to play... not worth spending money for this. 
5441	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
949	1	a	Even if you don't reach for scoring, it's a very nice game to play. I'm not in tower-defence but this TPS-ish version of it is much fun.
2652	1	a	This Game is bad but it makes fun with friends because you can trickshot dinosaurs! 10/10 :D
4481	1	a	Didn't play the game Still get to make a review 10/10 would review again
6145	0	a	This game is glitchy and buggy and the gameplay lacks any kind of fun You are only trying to find the small dinos in the grass (they are hard to find) to kill em and the you shoot the big uns  nah
228	1	a	I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.  Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed) Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense   9/10 in my book The only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue
775	1	a	Very fun game, give the demo a try!
1632	1	a	Fun little platformer that works well with both keyboard/mouse and a game controller. All the levels can be completed fairly easily, but also collecting all the bonuses along the way is considerably more challenging. Recommended.
1271	1	a	 https://youtu.be/OsnaGt0NXbA   Fire up your engines and tighten your twin sticks for 'Gatling Gears'. Overall a very solid game with minor flaws of aggressive forced scrolling and a little sluggish turning on your character.
3353	1	a	This game, after playing it for 8 hours, has shocked me. The gameplay was way over my expectations, as well as the graphics. The game has many different modes to play like rampage, a ctf like game, survival, and many others, making it an all around fun game to play. I mean â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was $0.99
1644	0	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is a game developed by the lone indie developer Jason Rohrer. Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game.   Insidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.  As a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music.   There are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.  Score: 3.5/10
1430	1	a	Good refinement of the fun gameplay of the previous game. A bit short and lacks co-op story mode, but worth the price for me.
6268	1	a	Has sience gone to far?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?  1337/10
1011	1	a	This game is great to play when you want to have a quick fun. Each party does not last more than 20 minutes, so you can play it every now and then.   The gameplay is easy to grasp and the challenge is well balanced so you get the incentive to start over some levels to get all the points.  I'm going for 100% achievements for this game, because it makes me feel like I can do it.  I will do it at my pace, one play at a time, every now and then.  And when I'm done with it, I'll download the sequel to keep the fun going.  That makes for a fun game, that I recommend.
584	1	a	A whole lot of manic fun, you wont mind how repetative it actually is under its shiny cell-shaded surface and you will have completed it several times long before you ever wanna stop playing it.  One of those games that Does Exactly What It Says on the Tin  Orcs Must Die!  4/5 (mash em, boil em, stick em in a stew.)
1707	1	a	Addictive and fun. Can not complain about the price too!
3190	1	a	10/10, bought the 4 pack last time it was on sale, gifted it to my friends, I now have no friends. Thanks Trek Industries!
5369	1	a	Crazy, stupid, but FUN!
5016	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
1815	1	a	IT's ok i guess.
437	1	a	An entertaining and comedy-oriented trap dungeon defense game.  It took me a bit to get used to the trap difference vs the usual tower defense games I play - but it pans out well in a very entertaining, challenging and rewarding way. The traps set up have a limited area of effect and react on a reset timer for most of them, so its a mixture of combinations of traps and your own wits with weapons and the enviroment to pull it off well.  It proves to be a good game that is well worth its value.
5072	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
4796	1	a	Great game Transformation!
3152	1	a	Okay - One of those blind buys, because it was cheap. DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! I have so much fun rolling around and blasting dinosaurs with my friends, I'd say that everyone should have this game - go buy a four pack and gift your friends and let the carnage begin! 10/10 would buy again.
6248	1	a	Do you like shooters? Dinosaurs? How about cheap buggy games that you can play with your friends and laugh your asses off for a good 3 hours? If you answered yes to all of these questions just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy the game, it's a dollar.  All jokes aside, I love this game, I get to rocket around with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ flamethower whilst burning dinosaurs down in a blaze of glory, it was amazing.
1435	1	a	This game is really fun and fast pased, the co-op is really fun. i really enjoyed playing the single player mode. this game is fun and if u enjoy indie games u should get this game.
3878	0	a	Ok, so this game is a bit misleading... 'The metacritic score is missleading' Notice none of these quotes have actual citation... Because noone but the developers said it. Don't be fooled by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t comments. Good thing it's on sale. This is the most revenue this game will ever generate.  WHY IT'S BAD: Ai is terrible, gameplay is simplistic and boring, artwork is meh. Don't waste your penny's. I fully intend to ask for a refund because I bought the 4 pack to play with friends.  1/10 (Because every game created deserves a little credit)
2537	1	a	bretty damn cool  I've always loved dinosaurs and really all the games about dinosaurs are pretty terrible, but this one isn't all too bad it certainly isn't a terrible game, infact it's has the potential to be fantastic, and it's almost there, but I feel like it's a little rushed  great to play with friends, and the dino vs humans mode is a blast with a lot of people  if you've played call of duty zombies, or ghost's extinction, it's very similar to that, and all the same fun
4430	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
1176	1	a	Great Indie Tower Def game. Havent had this much fun and laughed at game in a long time!
3770	1	a	What can you buy for 99 cents? You can buy random iPhone games. You can buy a very cheap packet of chips from Maccas. You can buy a frozen Coke from Maccas. You can give to a busker on the street.  Or you can buy Orion: Prelude and nuke dinosaurs with rocket launchers... in empty servers that crash a lot (at least they did when I played).  Angry Birds/10 would buy chips from Maccas again - IGN
3175	1	a	OMG THIS GAME IS INSANE! I recommed this game to everyone! I like to kill dino's ;D But those small creatures are hard to spot -_-
5239	0	a	A steaming, gigantic, dynosaur TURD!  Want to kill hordes of brutal enemies? Play killing floor... You love dynos? Go to a museum or watch discovery channel...   Please, for your own sake, STAY WELL CLEAR FROM THIS GARGANTUAN PILE OF DYNO CRAP!!!
4180	0	a	'we will not be pursuing legal action...'  ...because we would lose so fast our heads would spin.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ DEVs that steals assests, lies about it, gets caught lying, then gets all defensive and self righteous when the whole communbity turns his 'evidence' upside down on his â¥â¥â¥â¥ filled head.  for the record, those photos which 'prove' he didnt steal assests have been pretty much proven to be lies as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s of better non biased photos showing clear copying have surfaced.  for the record, I think Activision are a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s too, but at least they put the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a nice silver platter for you to see before you eat it. and they don't rerelease the SAME game under different titles to try to cover up negative reviews...this is now the 3rd or 4th name change since 2012.  oh, the game you ask?  .... it sucks.   it has and pretty much always will regardless of all the stolen COD/starwars/other assets.   (keep in mind I paid 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars for this garbage back in EA) *(working on refund for Gaming's sake)* deleting it regardless to make my own point if it fails.  gonna go play a GOOD game, like ARK.
2376	1	a	This is probably the best game that you can get for $1 (on sale)! Only thing I don't like are the microtransactions (purely asthetic). I would have preferred to unlock all the asthetic's through playing the game but really it's quite minor. This game holds it own and seriously is more fun and addictive then the shooter you are playing right now. It's a must get.
1198	1	a	These orcs must die, will you aid us?
2786	1	a	I recommend this game to the people who like first person shooters and 3rd person. There are tons of very uniqe weapons and equipment. PLAY THIS GAME!
1245	1	a	ORCS ARE HUGE, THAT MEANS THEY HAVE HUGE GUTS! SPIKES AND TAR, SPIKES AND TAR!
4793	1	a	i bought 4 copys of this game, might buy another 4..  its so great lol been gifting it to any of my friends willing to try it! it is crazy intense tho i only just got into the game i can see my self loving it for a long time to come
4242	0	a	They changed the name of this game several times. The name changing is so out of hand that the review on the game's page is from the wrong game. It's constantly being discounted to 99 cents for a reason. Not very fun, and multiplayer is a real challenge to get working. Plus no one plays it. Still doesnt feel like a polished game for some reason.
3110	1	a	Your game is the single worst â¥â¥â¥â¥en peice of trash i have ever seen in my entire life. â¥â¥â¥â¥ looks at ypur game and says gee that looks â¥â¥â¥â¥. I love it  8/8
3424	1	a	One time I was killin a trex and then out came a mother flippin jet and I was like ahhhhh yeah.
421	1	a	Gameplay : easy Atmosphere : good A wonderful tower defense game
6441	0	a	Turok with better graphics... need I say more?
3852	1	a	Really great game. Worth the price you pay.   Bought the 4 pack and it was the best. I recommend you buy it to.
831	1	a	A rather fun and whacky game where you defend and let no orc pass thru.. Use a dozen of different traps, weapons to slay and mutilate orcs hahah... Fun and very challenging! :D
2180	1	a	Is this seriously only Â£0.79?!  It's fun, it's lively, it's simple. Kill the dinosaurs, secure the objectives, buy cooler guns. This is a bargain, get on it.
5162	1	a	Cool Idea 
1188	1	a	If you're after a fun casual challenging but not serious game this is for you! Writing this review I'm only 3hrs into it and love it I definitely recommend this game purely just off how fun it is.   8/10
4023	0	a	This game is so broken. I haven't experienced any actual bugs, but the Dinosaurs are so overpowered that all the gamemodes aren't even that fun. Survival is okay for a couple of hours, but it is the only DECENT gamemode. All the others are just boring, overused by most games, and if there are dinosaurs involved, considerably unbalanced. For this game to go on 93% to get some sales just shows the desperation of this producer...   I would give it a 4/10 at most, and that is being generous. This game is pretty much a waste of a dollar, so unless it is on sale that much, I highly recommend not getting
4243	0	a	Played for 30 minutes and failed to find a reason to ever do it again. This could in theory be a really good game I imagine, it just doesn't quite work for a number of reasons. I didn't get any good explanation as to how anything works. The weapons and upgrades system is fairly basic and a little overwhelming at the same time for a newcomer, all the guns look and feel the same. The gfx/sfx are oddly bad in some places while decent in other places. Enemy models will often chaotically twitch for a moment, making it hard to aim where you want to, not to mention I saw every single raptor who got close to me from the inside because the camera was inside the model, something that shouldn't really happen.  Overall the game feels horribly unpolished and lacking any real substance. Then again it's dirt cheap and not downright terrible so I imagine it can offer some fun for good money if you find it more entertaining than I did.  P.S.: V as the default melee key and a second wind game mechanic that allows you to avoid death by getting a kill quickly enough... why does this feel familiar?
599	1	a	The first 3 levels were boring as hell, and should have been a 'tutorial'. After that it got much better.  It's ultimately a Tower Defense game, but the 3rd Person Shooter perspective makes it more fun. Being able to fight manually gives something extra to do between placing traps, and gives you a nice perspective to watch all the orcs die.
5233	0	a	So if you kinda have a old computer do not get this. If you have a realy old computer definetly dont get this. I dont know if you have a brand new computer maby get this  but its probely not worth the mony
1937	0	a	An awesome platforming game with a robot  I had doubts about this game on the first try, choosing the levels were weird for the first time, but after a few levels, it became clear for me, that level choosing is awesome and creative. The game in overall is lovely, story is a bit weak, but I don't think platformers are about the story.
2140	0	a	The devs jumped ship to release another copy of this game under the name 'Orion' to avoid the press on this game because they stole assets and fired their artists right before release so they didn't have to pay them and are now playing the victim and claiming it's a witch hunt because 'they're a small studio and wahhh AAA publishers are mean'.
6319	1	a	Don't try and fight the dinosaurs. Instead, run up the cliff until you reach the limit and watch everyone suffer.
1933	1	a	ellO this is morky ! played game for 26 mins, love so far !! completed first 4 lvls all on my own (help from doland) &gt;.&gt;
1373	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
2270	1	a	10/10 would get chomped again.
3410	1	a	We all bought this game as a joke because of the price and we had read the reviews of how terrible this game was. At one point, yes, this game was probably the worst game on Steam. Whatever the developers did in between then and now, it actually turned out to be quite fun. The graphics are actually pretty good (especially the weather effects), the controls feel solid, and it's fun to shoot dinosaurs.  There aren't are lot of classes (four) but the ones they have are unique and fill their roles admirably. The maps are huge and the vehicles are a blast to drive.  This game is 100% better if you have a small group of friends to play to log on with and just joke around killing dinos. For $0.99 everyone should probably own this game.
1713	1	a	Very fun, is intuitive and easy to waste time on. Also it is cheap and the level select is cool! 8/10 would BEEP again
4915	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RECAMEND THIS GAME 
6121	1	a	Its a fun game.
3166	1	a	Despite being pretty unpolished and seems like it was made by a band of chimps; it's still very fun.
1824	0	a	Nothing noteworthy about this side scroller. The gameplay is fairly tedious and doesn't really incentivize someone to keep playing.
1039	1	a	I love this game!  It has lots of levels which will supply you with hours of gameplay.   Every level you get a new spell or trap to use against orcs.  The game has very good graphics and dosn't lag on my $400 computer.  Over all I give it a 10 of 10.
2686	1	a	10/10 not expected games that cost 0.74$ (summersale) are bad, but not this one
1449	1	a	A funny arcade style beat em up.
4832	0	a	This game is the embodiment of an awkward child you don't want to sit next to at lunch.
1267	1	a	Gatling gears is an oldie. but goldie. i have to be honest they just dont make games this good anymore. you remember the days when there was a big buzz about games. and massive interest not just by gamers but by the guys making the games. and the way they was describes in demo mags. they use to love showing off what they done. showing you how much better there games had got and giving you demos etc so you could see for yourself how good it was. those days was golden. its just not the same anymore.   i definatley recommend this game. its an arcade shooter platformy type. you run around in what they called a walker back then. and you can modify it build it up improve it get better weapons and even change the way the walker looks.  its just one of those games that got a lot of love and attension. and its so easy to see. as soon as you pick up the controller the movements feel great, everything is very well put together. its also a really nice looking game. with nice lighting and shadows and sun glare. black smoke effects that look great. nice explosiojns. and so much more to enjoy.   i promise you this is a game you wont regret buying and its so good value now. a must buy ive loved this game for years. its kinda special. and big.
1054	1	a	An enjoyable strategy/action game of a single war mage against an orc army. Quite short, but I enjoyed the challenges and uniqueness that came with it.
3347	0	a	For a game I have played for less than an hour, ORION: Dino Horde left a lasting expression on me. Not the kind of lasting expression that leaves a pleasent taste in your mouth, like tasting Auntie Anne's fresh home-brewed strawberry lemonade, more like the the type of expression that horribly scarrs you for the rest of your life.  I bought this game for a very steep price, like, dirt dirt cheap. I could have bought gum instead of this game, if that puts in perspective. This game, unlike gum, did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I'm pretty sure a piece of Trident layers would have lasted me longer than this game.  Upon launching, I was greeted with a nearly 780 FPS loading screen, which subsequently dropped to an FPS of about 20. I can run solitaire at a good 25 FPS, so this game had no excuse. When entering the very first game ever with one of my friends who I talked into buying this game, promising him we can shoot dinosaurs in the face until the early morning. He called me a nerd, and he was right. I was a nerd who was sucked into this game under promises of shooting dinosaurs and having fun.   My hopes were smashed, and upon dying to a lag-spiked Triceratops who appeared to be doing the thriller, I called the game 'bad.' My friend also agreed, telling me I sucked quite an exorbant amount of male genitalia for making him buy this game. Alas, he was true. I do suck.  Not as much as this game though.  
5761	0	a	Played it once, uninstalled, no regrets.
2401	1	a	Killed a T-rex with a pistol before I revived my fallen caped crusader who shot me with a med-gun as I jet-packed over the next stegosaurus. I now wear the T-rex's head on my head. No â¥â¥â¥â¥.
112	1	a	Just played it through and left wanting for more. It's a simple game to learn, if you know poker hands. Poker hands are used to do battle against foes. Among poker hands, you get to use spells, allies that have different powers and pet abilities. I love the tactic and mathematic side of winning the battles. Not having much time to play and having to get off the chair before my computer a lot, I'm happy that it's turn based and that you can save between every battle. Hope there's going to be more soon. :)
1941	0	a	With the sticky, unresponsive controls, to the sheer force enemie throw at you, no wonder this game was 50 cents.
4027	1	a	Oh look. A bunch of people jumping on a witch hunt and ruining someone's livleyhood based on activisions unprovable claims on a non-competing franchise.   Get real people -- errors have been corrected; hence why the game is back up for sale. The worst are the people changing overhelmingly positive reviews based on here-say like truly ignorant white knights.  If you want to go blast something go hate on the re-re-re-released version of the WarZ -- Shattered Skies. Those people deserve all the hate the world has to offer and more.
1248	1	a	dumbass war mage+orcs+traps+magick crossbow+magick sword+more rediculous traps=â¥â¥â¥â¥tons of dead orcs  but seriously this game is awesome, its a hero defense game, stop orcs getting from a to b using traps soldiers or slaughter them yourself, i had lots of fun playing it
2622	1	a	Using the Unreal Engine, this game is a combination of Halo and Killing Floor, only more entertaining. With three classes to choose from and a extensive leveling up system, this game is one awesome indie title for the ages. Orion has difficult but pleasant battles with all kinds of dinosaurs, including T-Rexs. It is very satisfying to fight and kill these very large and prehistoric beasts. The fast-paced shooting works greatly and I most definitely recommend this title for everyone.
2153	0	a	This Is way more horrible than the metascore suggests. I dont see how anyone in their right mind would play this for fun, aside from laughing at how horrible this game is for a few minutes. There is a reason this game is only up for 99 cents. The paid reviews should be investigated as well.   Buyer beware.
5413	1	a	5/5
2827	1	a	Not A Bad Game
4606	1	a	This game was bad, now it is good
5768	1	a	Do you like flying around in a futuristic robot suit? Do you like sneaking behind dinosaurs and killing them off with a knife? Do you like playing as a T-Rex and eating your friends while you're at it?  Then this game is for you!  - Although repetitive, the game does not fail to bring surprises in every session (wait for that huge pumpkin man). - I like the big dinosaurs that spawn every now and then (TRex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, etc). - The vehicles are a great way of traveling around the map especially when objectives are far from the base. - The AI is actually quite smart when you play solo. They know how to ride vehicles (given you're the one who's driving), and they know what to do and when to do it. - There are only three classes to choose from, and this might discourage some from purchasing the game. - The game is actually quite cheap for what it is. - There is no single-player campaign, but there are single-player game modes. - It's like Dino D-Day future style, but with lots of game modes.
4160	1	a	Its good.
318	1	a	Pretty accurate marketing.
6226	1	a	A really good laugh
2926	1	a	Deserves a lot more love!
4839	0	a	It has potential but its not fully realized the game's menus are absolutely horriffic and the chat menu is annoying as hell in game. It seems like a cool idea shooting dinosaurs but needs more polish. ALOT more polish.
975	1	a	Awesome game! One of the best in Hero Tower Defense genre.
5357	1	a	Got a couple hours into it. ha the first halo feel to it, i think it has alot of potential but it needs to be heavily optimized in the sense of LAG. hope to see what it grows into and for .99 cents whats to lose. 
3607	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play a video game with state-of-the-art graphics, intuitive controls, and creative multiplayer modes? Neither have I, and the developers of ORION: Dino Horde seemed to understand just that. They have pandered to what is assuredly a golden niche market: true hardcore gamers. Because I am the type of person who can confidently identify 'skrubs' who 'get rekt' because they are indeed CASUALS, I can say without a doubt that this game is not for the faint of heart. To really understand Dino Horde, you've got to have the HARDCORE GAMER attitude. Just remember our mantra: 'Anyone who doesn't enjoy a video game that appeals to a select group of people for any reason- be it the challenge it presents or because THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERING OPINION- is a casual and therefore terribly pathetic.'  I think I speak for millions of elite gamers when I say that ORION: Dino Horde is the next Dark Souls before Dark Souls 2. Some folks just can't get into it because they find it too hard and give up in the early stages of this masterpiece. What these NAIVE FOOLS need to understand is Dino Horde is the type of game where you learn by experience. Once you get the hang of the game and start to understand it for what it really is, it presents you with new challenges that build on knowledge you have acquired by simply playing the game and not giving up. That is the beauty of ORION: Dino Horde.  The controls are FLAWLESS. Anyone who says otherwise clearly has no idea what they are talking about. The HUD and the gameplay do not at all feel like crummy ports of the Halo franchise with dinosaurs. Each gamemode is unique and has an entirely different feel from the last. Everything about Dino Horde is so fresh and invigorating, you will never want to play Call of Duty again, which as we all know is one of the most ever-changing game franchises in existence.  American author and journalist Ernest Hemingway once said: 'Sarcasm is difficult to detect on the internet,' and apparently so is honesty. What do dumb ol' books have to do with ORION: Dino Horde, you ask? You didn't hear it from me, but word around the office is this game is the best of its time, and will be for years to come.  I'll leave you with this final thought: Why buy ORION: Dino Horde? No, really, why?
4741	1	a	10/10 This game is pretty good. Also its easy get money to upgrade your weapons and the dinosaur are really  strong yeah. more games the dino are easily died and also i apperciate this game coz it really good and the map  are big and when came on the round 20 or 30 the dinosaur are getting to many. but the best for me the halloween  map 1 coz its pretty hard to kill the all the pumpkin dino. and this game is good. who make this good but the graphic  are not so good but anyway this game good.   ó ðð°ð»ðð´
2577	1	a	This game is some of the best fun I've had playing a multiplayer on the PC in a VERY long time. Thumbs up from me!
6255	1	a	Definitely a fun way to kill a few hours with friends, and it's cheap, which is great.
4525	0	a	What a waste of 99 Cents.
3438	1	a	Shoot dinos and hope for the best   9/11 i give
4143	1	a	its a good classic
1801	1	a	It's fun .... I mean .. it's fun :))
4103	1	a	There are SPOOKY dinosaurs dont play!  10/10 WOULD â¥â¥â¥â¥ PANTS AGAIN!
2161	1	a	Lol why did I buy this
2558	0	a	it sucs
1592	0	a	my computer made an ibomber on this product so I can't load this high quality product
5666	1	a	melee is so op but awesome, THIS GAME IS GREAT! =D
1571	1	a	Great, fun, tower defense game. It's a fantastic time-waster for when I have a few minutes before class.
1491	1	a	A good game marred by horrible console porting. Poorly optimized and bad controls (arrow keys instead of a mouse, wtf) means it can be very frustrating to play at times. But still, you should probably try it anyway. It's like Portal but with more exploding scientists.
1141	1	a	Tons of Orcs, tons of fun, plays like dream â get this one!
3925	1	a	at a buck, you gotta own this.
4088	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs
2939	1	a	Not a bad Dinosaur Horde Survival game, but for $1, its a steal of a game! Definitely get it, since its one buck.
5973	1	a	More fun than a stripper with no inhibitions at a bachelor party!
829	1	a	A tower defense game mixed with RPG elements and a 3rd person perspective on your hero. A really enjoyable game where you are a young wizard defending the onslaught of orcs. You set up each mission by placing your 'towers' (in this games case, traps) to slow the orcs down. This is only your first line of defense as you control the young wizard once the round starts. Cast magic, go melee, fix traps, and much more.  I would recommend getting this game before purchasing the sequel. Sure the second one has two player co-op, but this will be cheaper and allow you to get a feel for the game. If you really enjoy the game and, like myself, find yourself wanting co-op play to add new deminsions and strategy, grab the second one. If you are quick, grab both games from Humble Bundle (as of this posting 12/10/13) and get both games, all DLC, for $4.25.  I highly recommend giving it a try. Watch the video/trailer to see if the playing style is what you are wanting too. If not, then don't waste your time because you will not be satisfied. If you are intrigued or thinking, 'yeah I will give it a try. looks fun!' then you should buy this right away.
1588	1	a	I found this game abit more challenging as compare to iBomber Defense Pacific, because of the Axis mode.
4935	1	a	Best Graphics ever. Possibly the greatest dinosaur shooter ever. - 1/10
4211	0	a	  Cool game but i dont play it very often.
2654	1	a	I hit a dead T-rex with a vehicle, t-rex flew into the air. 10/10
4897	0	a	Even though it has a gamemode where you can play as a dino but its not that fun deinosuchus hardly works for me i cant kill anyone I hate that my fav dino raptor only has one attack never choose raptor if your playing with pro players I dont even try to play as compy ptera the only dinos that are good spino,trex,triceratops,stegasaurus i didnt even remeber the rest of the dinos if there are more even for the price its at i still dont like it
2364	1	a	Mid or Mac because Mid is not Mac but when Mac is Mid it is
5276	0	a	dimond in the ruff mabey in 2001
3280	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
6469	1	a	Keep stabbing ankle on that T-Rex!!!  8/10
382	0	a	I played a few hours and got bored.
5487	0	a	Not what i expected... But gj to the devs anyway
2230	1	a	36 Metascore, everytime for 1 Euro... Dont care about that... The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome!
5191	0	a	One of the ''WORST CO-OP GAMES IN THE WORLD''
5778	1	a	This is a fun time killer! No plot, no mystery, and for shooter fans, no learning curve.  Loads fast and play is fun.  I call this a win.
1976	1	a	Nice game with pretty good idea with lovely little robot :-)  Verdict: 6.5/10
3944	1	a	For 99p its a good deal, he maps are very big and open and everything looks pretty. Its difficult to keep track of players as they tend to die in two chomps, the sounds are repetitive and the voice commands are so cheesy they would be rated extra mature. Fun for multi player if you can have a laugh at some of the physics, its no Serious Sam and you get exactly what you pay for!
5978	1	a	i love this game and the tank is so awesome
5883	1	a	dis, dis is a good game, buy it, it cheap,buy it ,it is like aneling youurself with a fineliner 
4681	1	a	Its an amazing game, cheap and so worth the money. I'd definite suggest it, but i will warn you that the graphics could use some work, as well as the frame rate, if they could fix that, this game would be out of this world!
1104	1	a	This is a brilliant core defence/tower defence mixed with action combat. With the well thought out ability to upgrade perks within the levels, high customisation of object placement and damaging objects already built into the maps ready for you to trigger; this is a must have title for any core defence lovers.  The only downside I have found so far is the inability to foresee what is coming on the next wave so you can plan accordingly.
1180	1	a	Funny, and fill the time, when i need some crazy destruction
3136	1	a	first it was bad but now my its 1 euro and its free for now its killing floor halo and tribes combinde do i recomend YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1001	1	a	Hilarious, fun, wonderful. Worth every penny, action packed and strategic.
4009	1	a	Dinosaurs are destroying your generator! Are you a bad enough dude to kill them all?  Dinosaurs/10
126	1	a	Nice tower defense-ish game. Basically you have to control the flow of Orcs in such a way that you manage to kill them all (either with traps or by yourself).  I think it is quite a good game. Also you can get it cheap enough as it currently is in the Humble (Jumbo) Bundle.
6351	1	a	Just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing epic with your friends
5717	0	a	This game sucks because of the graphics, even thou it cost as much as a Mc Donald burger
2615	1	a	I honestly didn't have much thought about this game when I first started, I thought I'd play it once, think 'Yeah, alright, good laugh' and never touch it again.   I absolutely love it. Fun, frantic, fast paced, and getting ontop of a rock with an LMG spraying down dinos is immensly satisfying.   Easy to pick up, easy to play, little brain processing required - good, simple fun.
4913	1	a	Definitely worth $.99. You can probably get it for less if you trade cards for it on the trading forum.
4931	0	a	4/10 it's not worth the $15
296	1	a	addictive game!! really awesome arcadish kindo' game graphics but really superb!! While playing the game its intensity and quickness makes me too much impulsive!
1623	1	a	It's cute but really, really casual. I can't play it longer than a few minutes. The graphics are cartoony and cute, and the sound isn't all that spectacular, but it gets the job done. The goal is to guide your character (in a teacup (!)) towards the finish line while trying to collect as many sugarcubes and stickers as you can, and, at the same time, avoid enemies. Like I said, it's casual, but the difficulty ramps a bit up later on.  [Rating: 71/100]
5800	1	a	orion is the greatest game I've played this year
4658	1	a	Yeah This game is great the graphics could be alittle better but im not complaining . if natural selection 2 and halo had a baby, this would be it (even though u cant play as dinos) overall awesome game
3913	1	a	AMAZING JUST AMAZING
3035	1	a	9/10 would be 10/10 if it was called orion dino beatdown again
3230	1	a	It's like PlanetSide 2, with dinosaurs!
5309	1	a	It's alright, probably not as bad as a lot of nerds are making it out to be
5385	0	a	Fun for about 10 mins
5101	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
4813	1	a	Make sure you watch out for those Spinosaurs, dem motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥as ain't just jackin' off in the corner, they'll â¥â¥â¥â¥ in your cornflakes.
4202	0	a	I might change my opinion, but for now, my review is short and to the point - like my play expirence. It SEEMS like a really good game, and soloing with bots it feels like it would be fun with a group, but joining a server is impossible because of the numberous issues that come up.  Yes, yes - I know the forums list solutions, but there are a zillion to try and they are insanely involved - more so than one should expect to go through for any 'finished' game. This feels like a buggy alpha, not a full release.
350	1	a	Great game, great times! Funny easily enjoyable game.
4693	1	a	This is a great shoot the dinos game and a lot of fun :)
4585	1	a	  Got this game for super cheap one day, and it is actually a lot of fun, you will run around with no idea what you are doing and still enjoy yourself. No it isnt the BEST FPS out there, but it is absolutely worth playing.
1229	1	a	Surprisingly funny game. You're a young battlemage, who uses his crossbow and tons of traps, to hold back incomming waves of orcs. Though it sounds like a standard Tower-Denfese game, it personally reminded me of Dungeon Keeper 2. I approve!
4701	0	a	What am I even doing here?
4277	1	a	So bad its good. Pretty much just a crappy halo but with dinos as ur enemy would say u should play it with group of friends or else it may not be as humerous it just a silly game u can mess around in with friends, ull have more time laughing than actually bothering about wats going on
5533	1	a	Best game to get Call of Duty guns
1416	1	a	Not a prison â¥â¥â¥â¥ simulator, I was disappointed.
1785	1	a	BEEP is a puzzle game where you solve puzzles with a gravity gun and kill a bunch of evil robot thingys which are... being evil in the star system your BEEP-Ship has discovered. Your BEEPs must explore 2 very different zones across the each 3 planets in the system collecting anti-matter along the way. Each zone is 4 levels long and each level and zone increases in difficulty. Each level has 3 chunks and 25 nuggets of anti-matter. Collecting all 25 nuggets will award you a fourth chunk. Anti-matter allows you to unlock new zones providing you've completed all the levels in the previous zone. You will traverse methane oceans, volcanic valleys, a purple forest and death, so much death. You can get a total of 96 chunks of anti-matter although you only need 60 to unlock the final zone. At the end it's hinted there may be a sequel!  Paragraphs? What are those?  Rating: 9/10 because I get angry when I die.
4258	0	a	Hilariously bad coding, icons quite possibly stolen from Apple's iOS, and unintentional surrealism (read: bizarre ragdolling) combine to produce a quite mediocre dino-killer surprisingly reminiscent of Halo (with dinosaurs), but nowhere near as good.
6058	1	a	Surprisingly fun, like Halo with dinosaurs
3482	0	a	The only thing that is cool about this game is that you get to shoot dinos otherwise it is like quake went stonage minus the fun.
4389	1	a	Loved the game it was by far the best dinosaur game ive played i got to do lots of things be dinosaurs, kill dinosaurs, ride vehicels, lots of gamemodes, it was the most fun ive had.
5069	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
5661	1	a	For the money it costs, you can really try it. I don't know how it was at the beginning, but I just bought it for 49ct and it's totally worth it. Only thing I don't like is the weapon system.
5250	0	a	I Want my money back!
2792	1	a	This buggy game is actually pretty fun when playing with friends!  This has a 5 player co-op.  i find the original price to be too high, I think this game should be around $5.00.  However, me and a lot of my friends only paid $1.00.Worth every penny. :D
5540	1	a	This game is a little like passing a kidney stone made out of angels.  Space robots fighting dinosaurs is something i only knew about from the ramblings of my drunk uncle when i was but a child, to be able to experience it first hand, brings forth a feeling of pride, honor and dinosaurs to me.    If you like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥, buy this game.  If you don't like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥ please consider sounding with a fire extinguisher.
3631	1	a	This is the creation of the smartest minds of this generation working together to create the worst game in history.  10/10 I was mindblown. 
5678	0	a	Man there goes 1 buck, that's 1 bag of m&amp;m's...
5151	1	a	Liquidy purified AIDS condensed into a mess. Took me 20 minutes untill I was searching up how to permanently remove it from my steam library. SUCC/10 Willl never achieve THICCness.
1934	1	a	Bought game for 21 cents, sold cards and got 7 cents each. Thanks for the free game. 10/10
2433	0	a	It isn't amazing but it isn't awful either. The game is a decent amount of fun, but Trek Industries is a trashy and shady company. I'm usually all for supporting indie devs, but Trek takes things to a whole new level. They're manipulative and money hungry. They lie, fire employees without paying them for their work, and they steal assets from other games as well. I cannot recommend buying this or any other games they may be involved with.
4537	1	a	Although I have only put about 5 hours into this game (as I have to update it and been wanting to install other games first), this game is addicting!! Halo meets Star Wars vs Jurassic Park! Incredibly broken but my brother and I couldnt stop laughing from the sheer insanity of it all!! Shows what a .99 game can do and outshine some of those games that want $19.99 and are just subpar. What are you doing here still? BUY IT MEOW!!!
5230	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
1607	0	a	Horribly balanced game. The first several missions were incredibly easy, then suddenly the difficulty jumps to impossible. The second to last mission I tried was so easy that I didn't have to buy/build a single tower for the last 1/3 of the waves. Then I couldn't beat the following mission no matter how many different tactics I tried. At that point I gave up and haven't bothered playing this again. There's too many other good tower defense games out there to bother with this one any more.
5192	0	a	probably the worst game i played for 10 minutes
3365	1	a	Ten times better than Call of Duty. 11/10
1723	1	a	Press R to re-load your weapon.  that should be included in the tutorial.  no other complaints, great game.
182	1	a	KINDA REMINDIN ME OF MY DAWG RUFUS WHO GOT HIT BY A TRUCK NIQQA LOOKED LIKE A FKN ORC YA DONT WANNA NO  GAMES GUD CEPT FOR THE BICH @SS MAIN GUY WHO LOOK LIKE HE TAKING A GIANT TURD ALL OF THE FKN TIME  WE STILL HERE NEFF MARCH 2K14 HOOD
967	1	a	Verry nice, and fun game, the best game to come down if you are mad :D
761	1	a	There's so many positive things I can say about Orcs Must Die. It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought.  Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps. Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system.  Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay.  Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.
5953	1	a	Probably one of the best games for that price, tonnes of fun and lots of achievements to be won
2175	0	a	The compeny behind this game is a real flock of scum bags so don't bother supporting them.
5353	1	a	beta for battlefield 4's upcoming dinosaur dlc
3870	1	a	cool game
650	1	a	Very fun game for the first 2 hours, then the difficulty falls off a cliff and most people stop playing. I've been back to push through a few times but the novelty is gone. A good buy, just know ahead of time that you will probably only get 2-3 hours gaming from it.
431	1	a	Very fun and underrated game.
2728	1	a	The best co-op survival fps game ever! You like Killing floor? Halo? Evolve? You should try this one then! You pay only a dollar for a great unique gameplay that will combined with beautiful graphics and some personal system that include level, stats, achievements, etc. It's a profit to buy this w/ your friends ;) 9/10
1059	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is just some GOOD CLEAN FUN. Must play!  Seriously, great game. Guess you could say it's RPG trap defense. Third person shooter, puzzle, whatev. Damn good gameplay. Smooth as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s â¥â¥â¥. The sequel is even better!  10 / 12
6095	1	a	Think Tribes with dinosaurs. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, but it has the potential to become one of those games that get popular for being bad, a sort of cult following. Other than that, the game was poorly executed, IMO, but a nice idea
3696	0	a	The optimisation of this game is horrible. The game itself is very repeditive, some of you may disagree but I guess the $1 it is currently on sale for is the chance for you to try it yourself. Might just be another number to add to your account. I'm not telling you not to buy it but it still may tickle your fancy. It's just not my kind of game.
2620	1	a	Devs actually fixed it. Game don't suck anymore, guys.
4355	1	a	One thing I can't figure out... I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale. Now, all of a sudden I have to buy it a second time, and at full price? Why is this happening, I thought I already owned this game.. Other than that. The game itself is awesome in my opinion, I love the halo-esque feel when playing it, then throw in dinosaurs. Done... All in all, it's a great game and would love to continue playing it, if it wasn't for the fact I apparently have to purchase it again. Hopefully this problem will be fixed one day.
4082	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
3605	0	a	So... The rewiew... Bought this game for 1 euro so i dident know what to expect. Now i know. This is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ive ever played. I dont think you can make a game any more bad. I put the graphics up to full and it still looked like â¥â¥â¥â¥... When i got into my first game there were no other torturial than 'Use wasd to walk' And thats it... Nothing else was there and i just walked around without knowing what to do..  1/10 ....
3991	0	a	after watching the first trailer on store page, and read the 'comments' in this video i thought 'wow that must be really cool- so much positive comments - and wow they say its like killing floor and borderlands and turok. wooow'. but it was not.  after few seconds on title screen the backround music makes you puke. then startetd the game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphic, â¥â¥â¥â¥ sounds, â¥â¥â¥â¥ viewmodels, no atmosphere. this game maybe good.....if you are 12 years old and we have the year 1997 and you re totally in halo or dinosaurs.
2918	1	a	With the gun style of Borderlands and the HUD style of Halo that makes this perfect. And you kill dinosaurs. DINOSAURS! How can you not find 99 cents for this game! Within 10 minutes of starting my first game, my friend and I were in tears because of how much fun this game is. 10/10
3484	0	a	The budget for this game must have been $2 :(
2313	1	a	I played this game a little while ago and it wasn't terrible but it had things in the game that just were not done well. But now it seems the Developers actually saw this and unlike other game devs they actually fixed â¥â¥â¥â¥. NIce job
793	1	a	10+ hours.. Awsome TD/HD game.. Lots of jokes.. No multiplayer.. 9 of 10..
198	1	a	This game is amaizing! Worth every penny! Can't wait for more DLC's to come out.
2004	1	a	So goooooooooooooooddd... its free trading cards are like 55 kr then this game is 40 kr :) hacks 
5272	0	a	Game has great potential but it's spoiled by the mass amounts of lag and uncomfortable experience.
2837	1	a	Metacritic rating is very misleading. This game is quite fun: lots of guns, perks, and powerups to buy in each individual map, as well as a leveling system that applies permanent passive bonuses.
1608	1	a	Quick little stress buster!! 5/5!
4379	1	a	i mean, its bad, but it IS a fun game with friends xD
5682	0	a	I'd rather watch paint dry than play this
194	1	a	This is one hell of a fun reverse-tower-defense game, mixed in with a FPS. Great stuff. If you like battling orcs, then you'll love Orcs Must Die!
1585	1	a	This game is very addictive. Maybe its the sound effects, maybe its the blowing up of stuff, i dunno but its definitely fun :-)
5335	0	a	To be honest this game offers nothing new. You're better off playing halo, or team fortress.
2099	0	a	Stop stealing you s**ts.
3674	1	a	- Walked out of base - Chased by huge horde of dinosaurs - Watched teammate get taken by a Pterodactyl - Ran for cover - Found tank - Jumped in tank - Destroyed angry Stegosaurus with tank - Massacred dinosaurs for a 'MONSTER KILL' - Triceratops bashed tank to death - T-Rex ate another teammate - Died to horde  10/10 - Would die to play again!
4536	1	a	really great game! Zombies gameplay but with dinosaurs is brillant! the weapons and graphics fit quite well with the era(whatever era it may be anyways) and the objectives and conquest are deffinitly the winning game mods here! they've done an amazing job with this game and i can't see it going anywhere but to the top!
5518	1	a	Screw the Meta-critic this game is heaps fun!
6034	1	a	this game is a great game and you should totally buy it
3195	1	a	This game is good when playing in such as Lan party or something. A thumbs up game that every FPS player should have.
4071	1	a	Reasons to play! 1. Super fun  2. Completely free!  3. Supportive and open developer  4. Character progression and customization 5. Different classes for different play-styles and class roles 6. Dinosaurs (Duh!) 7. Jetpacks, mechs, helicopters, tanks, hovercraft, jeeps etc. 8. Lasers Swords and good sword play! 9. PvP and coop, and PVPVE too (players protect bases in teams and can sick dinosaurs on other teams) and gamemodes where you can be the dinos too 10. You can surf on the hood of your buddies jeep/hovercraft/tank/helicopter  Reasons to not play :[ 1. You hate fun?
1546	1	a	This is a fun little game, and the bonus of getting it on sale makes it worth having. Really adorable concept, if the idea of blowing up bad guys from the inside can be referred to as 'adorable'. I'd pick it up, you can't beat 7-10hrs of entertainment for $2.50 (especially when a movie costs like $8).
3335	1	a	cool game for $1 but, if you have a cheap computer/work laptop i would not buy this game. if you have an old computer with low amount of vram game will be semi unplayable
2138	0	a	Stealing content from other game developers and lying to their fans about it, deleting negative comments on their Facebook page, setting up an Indiegogo campaign to steal even more money from their fans (They donated $500 to themselves in the campaign to make it look like it is successful) @  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orion--5#/  , abusing employees (Firing them just before the release of the game and not paying them a single cent), abusing the current publicity they are getting (  http://imgur.com/s4WSxmf  ), threatening to sue people for having negative comments on their company (  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/d4rc74m?context=3  )    https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/   Also, this game is horrible in the first place. I bought this game last year and I have only played 0.1 hours for many good reasons.
558	1	a	Pros: +music +dialoge +so much orcs to kill +lot of traps, multiple ways to beat same levels +3 build paths in lategame +storyline &amp; main character Cons: -short (took 7 hours to complete and I think it's not the fastest time out there) -some levels were too easy to complete when other were somewhat challenging (last 3 maybe)
3779	1	a	This game is amazing! Definitely worth 50 cents
4543	1	a	When this game is on sale, it is TOTALLY worth it. Its a fun, fast paced, easy to get into first person shooter. I bought it for $0.49 and it was worth every penny. I have only played about 2 online rounds but still like it a lot and will be playing it more.  If you're looking for some kind of long story line, and tons of depth, this isnt it. Its meant to be SUPER easy to get into and get out of.  Although, it is buggy and I think the dinos get way to close to you and its hard to see them. But all the settings are there, FOV slider, textures, AA, so forth... Like it is going to get more and more attention as more people buy it. But it is not meant to be this super realistic game, just meant to be fun.
5821	1	a	The game has a broken rocket launcher and super glitchy cars with rocket boosters, nothing more needs to be said.  10/10 would play again for hilariousness
742	1	a	I first tried Orcs Must Die! 2 at RTX and loved it. So I get the first one. Solo is a lot of fun but playing it with a friend is the best way to play this game.
3368	1	a	Would be flung by T Rex again and make love to on dark nights. 24/10
5117	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
2957	1	a	Fun for while. Jokes for a while. Id reccomend of youre bored. 10/bored
138	1	a	This game is a blast it is easy and fun to play. The in game dialouge is funny and the story is understandable  RATE IT 8.5/10
6092	1	a	by far the best $1.00 I've EVER spent... 8.5/10
6108	1	a	It is so fun to kill all the dinos!
4367	0	a	This game is still HORRIBLE after three years of support. Please stop supporting it and let it die. If this is seriously 3 years of effort, you need to find a new career path.
2411	0	a	Don't spend a penny on this game, the servers are terrible, the graphics leave much to be desired, the attack animations are non-existent. Did they even try? It's good for a short while, but never leads up to your hopes. Please spend your money elsewhere.
3784	1	a	I really like this game. It has dinozavers inside. I mean - dinozaveri. THE TRUE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE.   U kill the dinozaveri and u look like a cool robot. Robots will zavladeqt the world, if they are rabbits, ofc.   i recommend this game. PLAY IT, FEEL IT, DONT GET DED AND REKT !    With alll my love, PeikaPLS
2923	1	a	this game is great
2713	1	a	The game is actually pretty good! the graphics are OK, and the sound design isn't crap. unlike what others say, this game is pretty fun compared to the bug-fest others make it out to be. Dino Horde borrows elements from other games, which makes it very familiar and relatable. Ignore the Metacritic review, this game is worth the purchase, especially if on sale
5377	1	a	This is one of the best games I have EVER played. It is a fast paced FPS sort of. Basically all you do is upgrade,upgrade, and kill kill. I haven't seen this kind of game in a while, so it is highly recommened. :D P.S: Anyone willing to gift this game to me? Add me on steam if you can.
1289	1	a	Shank 2 is a cheap game in every way, its hard, and occasionaly unfair. Its hard for me to recommend it. But still, I cant be unfair just because I've lost my nerves playing it. When you make it work it offers decent fun, interesting cartoon-network-like design, and some nice music.  Before you start, however, you better be playing this on the controller. Don't you even dare to play this on the mouse and keyboard, because you'll be cursing the day when you were born. I had to because my controller was working in one part of the day, and stopped in another (I dont have problems with other games). With the mouse and keyboard you are controlling your movement on the keyboard (also throwing grenades/molotovs/knives), and attacking with the mouse. The problem is that your character is following mouse cursor, so he attacks and shoots in the way where the pointer is, and if you don't pay attention you will swing/shoot/throw grenade in the wrong direction.  Another problem with controlls is that they are going nuts in co-op mode after you call-in menu window on 'esc' and close it, or Steam overlay on 'shift+tab'. Your character is dodging instead of moving (or even completelly stopping), using heavy instead of light attacks,... The only way to fix this is to press 'esc' again and then close menu window.  Boss battles are epic, especially the last two, that is - if you know how to dance... Just as with all other bosses in the game early fight is relatively easy. When their health comes near the first half you are getting an opportunity to perform some special attack that trigers a cutscene. Afterwards 5#!t hits the fan; since they are considerably larger than your character you can be damn sure they are going to exploit that in every possible way: they are going to grab you and squeeze like a lemon, throw you around like a rock, burn you, slice you in pieces, call their minions to help them, and generaly just make your life as miserable as they can.  By accomplishing certain tasks in the game you will unlock other characters with their own bonuses, and you can also use them in the co-op survival mode. You can play it alone or with the friend, and you have to survive 30 waves of enemies. With their elimination you are getting gold which you can spend in the shop (items are unlocking progressively), on healing, decoys, turrets, all of those will come in handy vs bosses (and zombies too).  I also have to say that playing hard mode of this game (no checkpoints in levels, once you die you have to start all over again) reminded me on the past when I have played, as a kid, NES games and throwed my controllers in anger....    
2064	1	a	I like this game very much, It is a very fun platforming game whith some challanges here and there. This game is really nice to have when you are bored/dont have any connection to the internet, i mean it only costs like 1 euro when its no sale goin' on so why not?  Have some exrtra money just waiting for lord GabeN? Why not spend it here?  I totally recommend this game like a 'secondary' game or offline game but it isnt something you wait all day long to come home and play after school but its a fun physics/platform game and my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ computer always hits around 60 fps so dont worry about the specs of your machine.
3899	1	a	Really fun in co-op
6217	1	a	first 15 min i was like wooh i dont get it but asi started playing it was the most bestest coop game ever  feature i like  1.bow  2.mech  3. dinos  
452	1	a	With Orcs Must Die!, the game starts off slow and seems to get quicker and more faster paced as you gain experience and get access to more abilities. Graphics are nice in this game as well. It Does seem to get a bit tedious after a long while and the pace at which the orcs spawn and rush in increases.   If you do not have a lot of time to be able to play because of work, schooling or family schedules but would like to spend 15 min, 30 min or an hour just relaxing, I would recommend this game.   So overall this game is enjoyable, especially if you dont always have tons of time on your hands.
5086	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
3165	1	a	Very fun game at a cheap price and is worth a dollar. It's pretty much Halo with dinosaurs instead of aliens. 7.5/10
2852	1	a	Very good game. Metacritic scores are misleading.
776	1	a	pretty good game if you just want to mess around and enjoy funny dialogue. theres worse things you could spend 15 bucks on
1263	1	a	Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist. Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes. The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace. The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy! The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the 'skull ranking' system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment.
90	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
404	1	a	no funny one liner here, just a whole-hearted recommendation. buy this game. then, if you still havent had enough, buy the second one,.. but this one is better.
3222	1	a	This game is quite good. I know that it got downvotet into oblivion by IGN and CO but this game is not quite good. Give it a try, you won't be dissaponted
5580	0	a	Clunky. My laptop can run DA:I, Mass Effect, and other much more demanding engines with ease. However, this game still runs like molasses.   The premise is enjoyable, however. For a game that proudly calls itself the worst game out there, a great success.
5927	0	a	Worst game ever. Like, NOTHING in this game works, except for the singleplayer. But that â¥â¥â¥â¥ ain't balanced AT ALL. 'Look at me! I've got a jetpack to fly places you can't hit me!' Assault-class all the way - eat â¥â¥â¥â¥ Orion.
5308	1	a	You get alot of content for $1... And if u get it half price, like me, it's INSANELY cheap.
834	1	a	Didn't play much of it but was fun while I did.
2081	1	a	For the sweet price of $1 there is little to comlain about.  I've bought $5 sandwiches and spent only 3 minutes on them. This I've spent over 5 hours. That's like 60 sandwiches.   10/10 Would have more sandwiches.
3324	1	a	Dino Horde is the best horde
1595	1	a	If you are thinking about buying this game call me first. I will then mail you a brick which you can break down and consume one painful spoon full at a time only to excrete it, again with pain, which you can rebuild it using your bodily fluids as a bonding agent.  After an hour of playing you will wonder why you are playing...Find a game with crystals *hint* if you are into tower defense games.
2039	1	a	Pretty, awesome game :) I had a little retro-feeling in it, but that lil' robot is so cute :)
2874	1	a	You can shoot a Tyrannosaurus with a lazer shotgun while flying with a jetpack... WHAT ELSE DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?!?! In all seriousness, I got this game on sale for 0.99$, (which it goes down to rather often) and I thought it was completely worth the price. At full price, I'd try to check out the game somewhere else first to see if you like it, but it's definitely worth a look. It has quite a few fun modes, and the gameplay is fast paced and fun. One of my few critiques though is while there is class variety (A soldier who can fly, a medic who heals, and a spy who can cloak) The distiction doesn't show up that much, and they're basically interchangable classes (So it's best to pick the one who can fly). Overall, a reccomendation to look at it, because you'll probably like it. It involves shooting hordes of dinosaurs while flying in a jetpack. Sometimes you can stab them with a lazer katana.
5969	1	a	This game catches alot of flak, I'm not honestly sure why it has such a low metascore, because personally I find the game to be a really solid co-op survival game. There's nothing outstanding about the game, but the jetpacks, vehicles, guns and grenades all work fine.   Load up the game with a few friends and this is a pretty good choice for come mindless shooting fun.
1307	1	a	Great game, nice graphics and works very good on controller. The survival mode is really good, even offline playing with your little brother, the fun is guaranteed.
1346	1	a	Named Shank 2 for a reason. Other possible names: Knives 2, Machettes 2, A lot of Blood and Badassness 2  +: woo hoo it's a fun game. Nice graphics, great gameplay, gamepad supp, intel to collect, difficulty is balanced, story, cutscenes, blood, blood, enemies, bosses, weapons  - : sometimes annoying deaths but that's because wasn't good enough :(  overall GG, 8/10 would slice through peeps again
5444	0	a	Ok, i know i haven't even played this game for 30 minutes, even 10 minutes. But here me out anyone looking at this review; the SECOND i got on, i thought this game was GREAT, but it turns out that the loading/menu screens were sexy looking.. When i got into a game and tried to connect; BAM, i lost connection. I tried 12 unsucessful times to get into a game and FINALLY got into one on my 13th try. The second i get into it, what does it say? 'Lost connection to host/failed to maintain connection' so i go back and i try again :P  When i DO finally manage to get into a game, the graphics were poor, the controls were CLEARLY meant for an Xbox 360 controller, NOT a console, and i could barely move around or anything due to that fact. And when i saw the Dinos i nearly â¥â¥â¥â¥ a brick -_-  They were awkward looking things, albeit their obvious attempted graphical enhancements.. so no, i won't recommend this game even though it was 1$  This game HAD good potential back when it came out awhile ago, now, however; it doesn't which is sad to say.  but HEY! who am i to tell people what to do/not to do? Go on and buy the game, try it out for yourself! But this is just my recommendation to NOT play the game. :) enjoy -_-
4376	0	a	as humorous as i thought it was playing for the first five minutes, this game did not sway me into buying into it. even with the sale price of 99 cents at the time of this review. is it entertaining? i'd like to think so? is it worth a dollar? debatable, at times it feels literally unfinished. wait, I take that back, pretty much all the time it feels unfinished. but I did enjoy the few minutes i played it but didn't see it go anywhere past 1 or 2 plays. if free gameplay and a 93% discount doesn't sway me into buying your game then i'm sorry i cannot reccomend buying this game. do play it at least once though. it'll be interesting.
4152	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
2527	1	a	I 1v1'd a T-Rex with a laser-cannon rifle
5132	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
5410	0	a	It sucks i got this game along time ago and guess what the first minute of gameplay it sucked IT SUCKS it sucks at sucking thats how bad it is IT SUCKS 
4815	1	a	Great game only if it didn't try to burn a whole through my proccesor.
5390	1	a	It is a funny game to lose time, for him price is ok. 3&gt;
5542	0	a	Do not buy this game, even as cheap as it is... the Dev does not deserve a penny for all his stolen assets.  Search 'ORION DMCA' and you will find a reddit post explaning everything.
3753	0	a	This game gave me AIDs and that means alot because i got it for $1 
6037	1	a	this game is just starting out and has great potential. Being able to kill players and dinosaurs what more can you ask for.
21	1	a	Fun card dueling game. Uses traditional poker cards / hands, along with special abilities. There's not a whole lot to it, but the gameplay is mildly entertaining. The story isn't very good, but I'll still recommend it if you can find it on sale.
3235	1	a	I could say a lot about this game being pretty standard shooter - but I have had some much fun playing this game. Shooting dinosaurs - levelling up and jumping around the map - this game is silly, surreal but fun.
2636	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs. Interesting environments. Unique weapons.  All this can be yours for just one easy payment of $0.99.
2362	0	a	So it got updated. And nothing from what I've noiced has changed. It's still the same boring buggy mess when it was orion: dino horde. Just go buy primal carnage instead. That's an actual good game where you shoot dinosaurs.
5746	0	a	Its really fun. Recommended
2000	1	a	Great game for the money at only 15p, worth it!!!!
926	1	a	Fun game. I guess I'd describe it as defense with traps instead of towers. Very similar to Dungeon Defenders, but where DD succeeded in its multiplayer, this game succeeds in its silly nature and delicious traps of death.
4022	1	a	For the two hours i've played. I highly rated this game, considering it cost me a whole 4 dollars on sale for 4 copies. However, i just wish the multiplayers worked for me, as it seems to for my friends. I want to murder some dinosaurs :( I'm going to blame the game, but i should probably blame my ISP. Would buy again, if on sale for 99c.
272	1	a	Bullet Point Review :  + Action packed and fast paced + Challenging when reaching the endgame + Cool soundtrack + Witty humor + Smooth looking graphics + The game really motivates you to finish it, which immediately sets it aside from 9 out of 10 games.  - Danger of getting stuck, especially for casual gamers. ( Real casual gamers, not the term 'casual' hardcore gamers like to use for the average gamer ) - Repetitive to a certain degree - Bullet projectiles make no sense ( you have to aim above the head to get a headshot )  Conclusion : 9/10
1668	1	a	Yo Dawg! We heard you like shmups, so we put a shmup inside your shmup, so you can shmup while you shmup!
3407	0	a	There is no learning curve or anything. When I started the game, I just got dropped in a menu, which let me connect to a game. I joined a game with the easy difficulty, and found myself dying very often in the 15 minutes I played. Furthermore, the game feels unnatural, and the graphics are weak for the system requirements. Furthermore, I experienced lots of lag when many dino's spawned.
1986	1	a	Really isn't my style, but was worth the 0.19 cents i paid for it :).
2853	1	a	It's a decent game i guess. A little bit of bugs and other stuff but it's ok. :3
298	1	a	I feel sorry for the female orcs..........
3289	1	a	Good Game But With One Major Problem.......The Lag Can Be Overwhelmingly Bad With A PC/Laptop Of Around i3, If The Curators Of The Game Could Fix It Then I Might Give It A 9/10
916	1	a	Orcs MUST die! Just as the title states! 5/10
3534	1	a	Doesn't take itself seriously at all and doesn't really need to, either. Basic but fun.
3772	1	a	Definitely underrated, but still gets boring relatively fast.
2642	1	a	Fun game especially when you play with your friends . Lots of fun and laughs. Many interesting weapons and vehicles , although the mechanisms are pretty difficult. Nice graphics too. Definately worth my 0.39 euro.
503	1	a	A simple action game about fighting hordes and lasting in a contention zone (a la Delta 8 Nova Prospekt in Half Life 2), with the twist of putting a lot of crazy defenses. A game for only fun and laughs, but that usually enough for a great time.
2738	0	a	I dont even know where to start, the game in short is a terrible mess. Ugly and confusing GUI and the game's graphics even on best resolution leave much to be desired. It amazed me because the screen shots look good, even fun, but like every movie trailer these pics were probably the best parts of what this uneventful game has to offer. Trust me whan I say this.... STAY AWAY you'll thank me later.  Update: The game has gotten better since writing my review, but it still is graphically inferior. If you see my review just skip this game and try the devs new game The orion project. This game has much more promise, its currently in early alpha stage but well worth the dollar.
2176	0	a	very much not a fun game, not worth the dollar it cost
1902	0	a	5/10 Scotty, beep me out  No matter if it's concept, engine, artwork or gameplay, everything feels like the devs have bitten off more than they could chew. After a complete overhaul (that hopefully doesn't make it stutter and lag on a 2015 PC anymore) it might be worth your money.
3774	1	a	This game literally gave me cancer. Thanks asshat chek ur privlege shitbirds sdufaisopjdfa;si9eruuuuuufhnoas
4924	1	a	Drove off a cliff with a bunch of people       10/10 would drive off a cliff again
4594	0	a	didnt grabet me on first plus but i have to say that this game was the first game that i see a ''team vs monster''game
3733	0	a	There are a lot of things to do, a lot of modes to try, and a decent selection of weaponry but overall it is very boring, glitchy and slow.
2435	0	a	I was not aware this game had stolen assets before purchasing. For 50 cents, it's a great game to mindlessly kill some time on, but after hearing about the theft, I regret supporting this developer with my purchase.  
4737	1	a	bought it for cards. played it and its fun enough to play for a bit
4947	1	a	I highly recomend this game. there are dino's to kill people! bring this game back from the dead! as in there isnt many players nowadays.
4852	1	a	Despite the metacritic's score, I found myself coming back to this game over and over. While I still use the same strategy and class, it hasn't stopped the game from being fun yet. My only complain at this point is the difficulty in hitting flying dinousaurs, as they sometimes get stuck in strange places.  Apart from that, it's a really fun game to play with friends, or with others online.
5918	1	a	Dino's are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cool!
4318	0	a	REALLY I WAITED 3 MONTHS FOR IT TO GO ON SALE  FOR A 4 PACK then i bought it for $2.99 NOW ITS FREE AND I DONT GET â¥â¥â¥â¥ TO SHOW FOR IT AT LEAST GIVE ME A COOL WEAPON THAT UNIQUE OR EVEN A CUSTOM SKIN  HOW ABOUT A REFUND? oh no steam will not cover that you played to long other than that game is fun just gets to boring tedious and repetitive  but if u love 2 grind play this   EDIT 1: i bought this game Feb 22, 2014  and i still got 2 copies left which i can trade but since the game is free  WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT
3430	1	a	Pretty much Halo with dinosaurs.
3881	1	a	100/100
347	1	a	Super fun game and all but Orcs Must Die 2 is out so just buy that unless this is mega on sale. Also buying this game will unlock some more levels in omd2. (7/10)
4965	1	a	SO this game from customer side, looks little boring. But. this game is much diffrent when you play. its AWESOME !!! kill dinos, buy weapons (but you will lose them after last wave). i dont know why its too cheap. but its cool.
720	1	a	Now this is a fun game! Combining stragegy and planning with frantic combat and dark humor this is easily one of the indie games I've enjoyed the most over the past few years. I could easily see this doing well on PSN or Xbox Live (if it isn't already).
2660	1	a	An AMAZING fps game! Just watch the trailer and you'll know why. This game has guns, jetpacks, tanks, helicopters, and dinasaurs in it! It's 99 CENTS just for the plain version, and the WHOLE game, PLUS FOUR PACKS are only 3.99! It's worth so much more! I would reccommend to anyone who is a fan of an fps, and surviving waves of enemies. I even got a four month free trial!
5491	1	a	Step:1 buy game  Step:2 install game  Step:3 play game  Step:4 ask why cant this game with pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics run on low with more than 5 fps this is on Radeon R5 with an AMD A8-6410 cpu  Step:5 ask your self this why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did i buy a 99 cent game on steam about killing dinosouars i could of donated that to charity Step:6 uninstall game and request a refund get denied for said refund  Step:7 save another 400 dollars and buy a cheap gun in real life Step:8 shoot your pc Step:9 insert gun in mouth  Step:10 regret that you bought a cheap flintlock and you only bought 1 ball  Step:11 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and whine in a review
2482	0	a	I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.  I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.  Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.  Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser. I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.  I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.  There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.  In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round. The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles. I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.  I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time. But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.  Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game. Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it. Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.     
5349	1	a	What can be better than shooting a t-rex in the face with bullets? Shooting a SPACE T-REX in the face with bullets. When's the last time you picked up a friend in a jeep and spent the after noon cruising the land scape, running over velociraptors, runnning from a triceritops, and dodging pteridactyls? Come visit the jurassic park of the future where you make the endangered extinct! Caution no small children or Jeff Goldblum allowed.
1882	1	a	you drive around picking up POPS my favorate cerial!  10/10
5087	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
247	1	a	One of the better tower defense games I have played. I'm more of a co-op gamer though, but when there is no one to play Orcs 2 with then this is a nice alternative, considering Orcs 2 is impossible solo.
559	1	a	Very refreshing combo of Tower Defense, Hack and Slash and a tiny bit of RPG. The style's also very cool. Orc-hating cartoonish stuff. Looks great
2479	1	a	I know what you're probably thinking. Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great. I personally enjoy this type of game and it's just action packed and will keep you on the edge of your chair.
6093	1	a	The best dino-killing-game ever. Its a fun shooting game, were you don't need to always shoot at player, but in stead have a great co-op. But hey! they got jet pack and medic gun, what can possibly go wrong :D
4034	1	a	great game and very cheap! I boght this for 24 cents :D 11/10 just buy this game :D
5721	0	a	I got killed by picking a gun up. 10/10.
380	0	a	I'm not a huge fan of tower defense games to begin with, so meh. In this style, Dungeon Defenders was far more enjoyable.
1696	1	a	Well , the levels are really challenging despite of it's childish background. I recommend this game to you if you suits the following list of targets. 1. You like to play ' looks like ' baby-level, low - inteligence but surprisingly challenging games 2. You are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 3. Your IQ is critically low 4. You are a lolicon 5. You are too rich that you want to throw money away for any games to level up the game count badge in steam profile. 6. You are bored to a point that you will do anything for fun NOTE : This game doesn't have manual settings for changing resolutions , language options, convert to window mode , or graphic level. You will have to access the files yourself.
1704	1	a	BEEP is the first title out of BigFatAlien, and judging from the quality of this litle gem, BFA is someone to watch.  The core gameplay is always accessible. It is a physics enabled 2D platformer that harkens back to the days of Super Mario and the ilk. It feaures a nice overworld to let you choose levels, and has a simplicity about it that is charming.  The BEEP itself is a darned cute character that certainly has my vote for President when he decides to run.  Music is top notch, sound design is great, and visuals are styled well and look awesome.  Easily worth the money. Stop reading &amp; go get it.
2782	1	a	Reason why the meta score is bad because the game is bad
5274	0	a	Its cool if you have so much lag and cant tell whats going on and just laught with your friends but when the lag is gone...
2835	1	a	this is a pretty good game, i give it 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family and would play 24/7 to save the little black people from Kony 2012
5466	1	a	I spent 10 dollars on this game in 2014, money that I worked for.
280	1	a	One of the most fun 'tower defence' games ever.
6079	0	a	The Source Engine would have been a better choice, doesnt make sense, poor aiming ability, promised big dinosaurs and big guns, world design :(
3592	1	a	L4D2 meets Borderlands... but with Dinosaurs. 10/10.  Also, Santa is a total Jackass in this game.
1513	0	a	Game looks nice but on my PC, it runs at ~15fps. Unless I find a way to optimize (unlocking fps in warpengine.ini did jack) it's $2.49 wasted.
6112	1	a	Pretty pointless, but fun nonetheless.
4789	1	a	A really addicting game, which with a group of friends and the help of the community can provide endless hours of dino hunting.
4545	1	a	This is Halo of Jurassic Duty 2 or Call of Jurassic Halo 2. This game is so cool and very fun to play
524	1	a	Charming.  8/10, would get thrust awkwardly into a position of overwhelming responsibility again.
3589	1	a	You can be a small dinosaur 100000000000/10
5376	1	a	so swag me and my bud quick scoped some dinos they dident see it comeing!
6477	1	a	Such an underated game. Just amazing!
992	1	a	Killing Orcs has never been more satisfying
4823	1	a	First off, Metascore is way off. This game is very fun, very fast paced, and can be very challenging. Think Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs. They're fast, deadly, and they are relentless. Raptors, Compys, Tri-tops, T-rexes, as well as many others make an apperance, and that's just the horde survival mode. Level progession system gives you more tricks to keep you interested, while scailing dinos keeps you from plowing through unhindered. Believe me, when you've got a T-rex, stegosaur, and dinosuchus chasing your â¥â¥â¥ down, you'll wish it didn't. :P Highly recomended.
6264	1	a	if i had the choice to buy this or call of duty i would defintley buy this even if they were the same price i mean you can buy four of these for a 1/9 of the cost of COD for you and your friends to enjoy and the bugs are usually enjoyable
5647	0	a	It sucks.  if this review gets downvoted 500 times i'll vac ban myself from this trash
4127	1	a	Bought this game for about 50 cents, and although its a little glitchy its just a fantastic game. For the money, its definately worth it.
5024	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
2226	1	a	METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE
4892	0	a	Very buggy, alot of glitches, fun for 10 mins... 
3348	1	a	Its a good game worth .99 cents i love how strange the guns look
5592	0	a	why
6212	1	a	Such a timekiller. Love it :) 
412	1	a	Fantastic game. Overwhelmingly positive critics are well deserved indeed. From all the games where killing is fun and creative, this is pretty much as good as it gets: OMD does not flatter finests instincts, but after over 2 gazillions of dead orcs, you may still find the resources to find it hilarious.
5498	0	a	I rather buy a big mac.
464	1	a	Quite fun game, but rather short. Beat the Normal difficult within 10 hours or so. Even then, the hardest difficulty proves very challenging and I can see beating it taking a lot longer. I'd give it a 85/100 or so, but if it's on sale, grab it for sure.
1351	1	a	What a butt.
4522	1	a	It is an ok game and it is definitely worth the fabulous price of 1$, it is pretty fun with multiplayer, there is workshop content and it can be played with a controller. It is laggy a lot but worth 1$, I had fun with this game. it is decent
4036	1	a	The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥, the mechanics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. they only good thing about it is the hour i spent laughing at how â¥â¥â¥â¥ it is
6452	0	a	I would rather eat â¥â¥â¥â¥ than play this game for 1 minute. (My playtime is idleing cards)
1029	1	a	Sometimes, I almost feel bad for the Orcs. Except, not really.
1609	1	a	Simple, good for a bit of fun.
3759	1	a	Tons of fun if you are looking for a mindless shooter.
2609	1	a	Hey, forget Evolve, buy this instead. It has assymetrical multiplayer, excellent co-op, different classes with leveling and perks, multiple different weapons, turrets, vehicles, and ridiculous fights.  It's really a lot of fun, and it's cheap! It's something you can play with anyone. Oh yeah and Workshop support? Yep.
1574	1	a	Good simple tower defense game. I had some good fun with it, though the Axis Quickplay missions were a bit more challenging than I would've liked. I recommend this game to those interested who are into TD games.  My score: 7.5/10
4363	1	a	fantastically cinematic shooter action, listening helplessly to your friend scream as he's torn apart by a T-Rex in slow motion, and avenging him with your bare hands is a rare experience, play with voice chat for maximum adrenaline
6288	1	a	I thought it was very good. It provided me with a fun experience and even though at the time it was early in development. Sorry it took me so long to write a review
8	1	a	weird and funny and worth the money
6221	1	a	This game was well made and now there selling it for so cheap, what happend that this game has to be sold for such low price its fun its entertaining fun with friends I don't understand it well I suggest buying fun game alot of fun with friends only 3.30 to buy for four of your friends why not?
4187	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.
4401	0	a	very poorly made game
6383	1	a	I purchased this game a long, long time ago; along with copies for friends of mine. We always thought this was a pretty fun (and sometimes funny) game but always ended up rage quitting from the wave mode difficulty. The developers have supported this game for so long, even though it wasn't the greatest game for the longest time. I have seen this game in turd stage, polished turd stage, and now it seems to have been overhauled. I can't wait to tell my buddies about the latest update! Keep it up!
4153	0	a	its a dollar. still plays like â¥â¥â¥ though. why do i have hours into this? thats a good question.
3698	0	a	I got this game for a dollar and i'm not sure it was worth it. The premise seems fun, but the lack of people playing it makes it pointless to play.
2711	1	a	This game is bad and terrible for a lot of reasons but it's somehow really fun to play.Am I going crazy?
4043	1	a	I have had so much fun with this game. I bought it as a joke to my friends and me to laugh off but its kinda hard when its acutally a good game :I  Its really entertaining, and seriously, where would you go if you wanted to shoot a dinosaur in the face with a shotgun while flying over it with your jetpack?!  Can only recommend this game.
2988	1	a	Wow This game is Really good, it only needs a tune up on the visuals and maybe a couple more classes. and boom HALO for 1 doller+ jurasic park.
4491	0	a	A poor quality game, poorly optomized, barely functional, and all around garbage. Everything that this game does, is stolen from other games, which do it a hundred times better. I mean this game isnt a -20 out of 10. but its like a 1 out of 10. its not even so bad its funny, its just dreadful. I got a four pack of this game for like 3 american dollars on sale, and I want my three dollars back. Id rather buy a soda or something.
1155	1	a	A masterpiece, must have !
2301	1	a	shot an Dino in his â¥â¥â¥ and he blew up 10/10
1419	1	a	Festival of blood and gore...
54	1	a	recommending this random game from my games library. if you dont like it, dont blame me: I havent played it, dont even know what's it about. To be more frank with you guys, I even think this game sucks. Happy playing.
5089	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
203	1	a	Epic Fun with a unique twist. An original game concept done well.
3596	0	a	wanna waste your money? Well, this game is for you!
2754	1	a	The whole time I was playing this game: 'WTF IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!?!'
4718	1	a	Doesnt work properly.
3530	1	a	The Customer base is relativly small, but this game has come leaps and bounds from when it was released. It is a satisfying experience upgradding your favorite class and taking down a T-Rex 1 on 1 or maybe even a spinosaurusl. So give it a chance and you wont be disappointed.
123	1	a	Orcs don't have to die, but they keep walking into my traps.
490	1	a	Everyone should check this out. Really great gameplay, really addicting and a lot of fun.
2052	1	a	very very very very swag flash game
583	1	a	If you're a tower defence/wave defence fan and enjoy ridiculous humour then I couldn't recommend this more. Sequel coming out soon - worth grabbing this before it does!
4281	1	a	Had this game for a while now,  10/10 would always recommend
5220	0	a	It's a mediocre dinosaur shooter. The gameplay is not very compeling and the graphics are sub par.
6038	0	a	This game may look fun however it is not. My friends and I played it and it was very boring and the graphics were really bad. Please don't even spend one dollar on this game its not worth it.
5853	1	a	For what i payed i'm proud to have bought a 4 pack and getting my crew started in this game! This has been one of the most impressive alpha progression i've seen. Also there is a bigger project behind this and from what they offre us here i c'ant wait the see the rest! One of my best alpha investments. Thanks to the dev.crew for such dedicated work! 9/10 !!!!!!!!!
3372	1	a	If you have friends, you are going to love this game.  You will need a decent computer to avoid fps loss, however.
1325	1	a	first game was really nice piece of fresh air for me in gaming, i was blown away with spaghetti western revenge theme and atmosphere, anti-hero and bunch of similar things.... i also highly recommend this second instalement in the series but in my opinion it is too identical to the first game. i assume i would be equaly amused with it as i was when i played shank for the first time, but to me it seems like some extra levels for the first game, it really does not add anything to feel like new game. i found nothing new in sp part but challenges are fun to play with friends i guess.
1837	1	a	buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥
1349	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
5881	1	a	Brilliant. Dinos + unreal. One of the greatest PC games of all time, also the cheapest game I've ever bought (was even discounted for multi-buy). Amazing. 20/10
5612	0	a	Devs blatantly stole models from Activision.  Activision isnt my favorite. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Call of Duty.  Content stealing is wrong.  Pretending to be the victim and misleading people when the person you stole from calls you out is even worse.  I'll never buy from this company again, they're only a small step above those plagiarism riddled mobile games.

2458	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, thatâs sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just canât see myself recommending it in its current state.   Rawwr!!  4/10  Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the 'improvements', however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.
3953	1	a	play this game with friends... its way more fun that way... 8/10
5633	0	a	These devs are bad for the community. Stealing assets and lying to customers.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC_-6U_93rU  
1166	1	a	Too hard. Have to be MLG like me to have any fun whatsoever.
2549	1	a	Dude... You get to murder dinosaurs with futuristic weapons and jetpacks and tanks... The vehicles all resemble Halo, so do the guns and maps for the most part. BUT WHO CARES YOU GET TO MURDER DINOSAURS!!!!!!!!!!!
4030	1	a	(Going to update this as time goes by, but just know that the dev does update the game to this day, and it's really good fun! I'd suggest the reason a lot of people don't like it, is that it's in a different gameplay style than they're used to. But seriously it's a 8/10 for me.)
6204	1	a	cant go wrong with this. cheap jurassic park, but even better than the movie: the game.
5610	0	a	I made the mistake of purchasing this game when it was first released and before I knew about the stolen assets. This game has been released multiple times in order to wipe out all of the massively negative reviews in the past.  This developer steals content from other games and then tries to play the victim when legal action is taken against them.  Don't support â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ business practices.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q77rg/psa_the_developers_behind_the_orion_project_have/ 
5104	1	a	It's a game with Dinosaurs in it. Why are you still reading this? WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT IT YET? LET ME SAY AGAIN, IT. HAS. DINOSAURS. IN. IT.
3420	1	a	i love the game but every time i try to play multi player it frezes right as it loads the map
1063	1	a	great game
5031	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
5113	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
2721	1	a	1 dollar, come on, thats chump change. Just get the game. Even if you're not going to play it just get it.
1282	1	a	Fun little twin stick shooter. Campaign is about 5 hrs long. It's enjoyable if you have time to burn.
1775	1	a	Best game for Best price!!
2333	1	a	This game needs better optimization but its good. I wish this game had a better explanation of the gamemodes, and it had more unlocks. The game dinos just seem to be repeating and have very bad sprites.
1013	1	a	both strategic and hilarious. great game. I absolutely loved it. Hoping for orcs must die 3
5674	0	a	In light of the recent scandal.  The first rule of playing the victim is trying to make people sympathetic, being a â¥â¥â¥â¥ doesn't help.
2812	1	a	This is my first review, and I'm only writing it because of the low metascore that is highly inaccruate. If you like to shoot at dinosaurs and fly around with jetpacks, this is the game for you. Enough said.
4874	1	a	make a version of it for ps4 it will be awsome 
4017	1	a	Dinosaur genocide simulator with T-Rexes that do flips.
5140	0	a	would rather buy winrar
1249	1	a	Very entertaining. You can lose several hours easily with this games.  As a mix of TPS, tower defense (but with traps) and strategy its a game where you have to think a bit which traps are best and where is the best place to use it.  If your not a tower defense player this game might get a bit boring after a few lvls.  But overall its a very nice game.
1275	1	a	fan game ant goot game ant 9/10
1443	1	a	This game is great. I just started it, but I mean I just have to write a review about sooner or later. Right? If you like games where you walk and fight enemies on your way, this is what you need to get. I like the idea that you can range attack and hand to hand combat and the story makes a great first impression. Like, Shank (I hope that's his name), he started as a prisoner and they start to get hi-jacked by these goons and everyone leaves. Except for one person, Shank. He sat there, stood up to them and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed them up. Can't wait to finish this game.  That's a great way to show that you can face your fear right there.
2753	1	a	I got $.99 and I spent it on this game!
332	1	a	A highly addictive 3D tower defense game that simply feels right; the game is just long enough, the trap and enemy variety feel diverse without feeling bloated, and the pacing feels perfect too.
6376	1	a	So, I had no idea this game existed until my boyfriend mentioned it to me. It's like Unreal Tournament, Halo, and Jurassic Park/Turok had the best megababy!  It is absolutely ridiculous and fun. There's still some glitchy-ness here and there, but I'm going to chalk that up to my computer or something, just sometimes I lag when the kills start racking up - but it's not so bad I can't enjoy myself.  Best multiplayer experience I've had in a long time!
4098	1	a	This game is awesome and worth more then its price i recommend this game for evreyone who want an amazing cheap game. best 99 cents i ever spend, 10.5/10
924	1	a	An execellent tower defense/strategy game with a little humor. Great graphics, lots of things to built, lots of magic to cast; and lots of maps to test your skills on. Most importantly, it's good fun.
4862	1	a	IT S COOOLLL AS HEC
5725	0	a	Developer has a bad habit of stealing assets and calling them their own, even defending the stolen assets. Here is the best summary I could find:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
2976	1	a	I got the game because of the sale and would have payed full price for it, I have a great time playing with my friend and gives off a sense of adrenaline rush that makes it extremely fun.
2909	1	a	If your looking for a game to chill with this is one of my favourites. Well worth buying when its oin sale :D 
2292	1	a	PHEW *Wipes Sweat From face* Just got done playing a conquest on wave 30, man what a ride it was.  It was litteraly the most enjoyable 2 hours spent on a match i've ever had!  There was never a dull moment each part had action killing murdering beating down dino noobs across the tundra. Got in my VTOL/Helicopter started wrecking all types of dinos across the map I felt like the damn ice age myself the way i was killing those dinos.  DOUBLE KILL TRIPLE KILL MEGA KILL ULTRA KILL ARMAGEDDON LAST BUT NOT LEAST BRING ME SOME PIZZA!  Those are the coolest kill streak quotes in the game i feel like a damn boss when they guy is telling me all that mojo! This game has AWESOME REPLAYABILITY I RECOMMEND GETTING IT NOW WHILE IT'S ONE DOLLAR! You're paying one dollar for a game that produces $60 of fun honestly, which in my book is pretty darn good.  Highly Highly Highly recommend this game to all you guys looking for something new or something to play with friends with this is you're game I for sure know it!
3309	1	a	I personally really enjoy this game, especially with friends. The graphics are surprisingly good (though I had to turn them almost all the way down to get it to work on my laptop) and there's plenty of variety in weapons. Sometimes a bit repetitive, but over all I'd say it's a really good game. Definitely worth the $0.99.
1042	1	a	Great tower defence game.
1499	1	a	One of my favorite games :)
5312	0	a	just pure garbage. for little kids and not even. this is just stupid.  Dont bother commenting if youre butthurt. I will delete your comment and block you. This is my review my opinion deal with it.
5546	0	a	Complete crap from a not so savory development studio.
3433	1	a	I nominated it for the 'i'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.  I'll never see that 49 cents again :(
3727	0	a	This is just horrible.
1697	1	a	Really fun! The controls and physics puzzles are great. I love the graphics and sound too. My only complaint is that the mechanics remain very flat until the last 2 worlds. The difficulty feels just perfect.
6091	1	a	Difficult to begin, but fun once you get going. More fun with more people playing with you at the same time.
5943	1	a	Fan-fu**ing tastic game!
2234	1	a	My friend said to me 'hey Protahto! this will be the best decision you ever made', I believed him. I have since killed myself from the hatred I bear for this game. Has some neat holiday themed updates. Fun times ahead. 8/10
2955	1	a	Like halo... with dinosaurs very good and fun
5686	0	a	lol these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ stole just about everything when it comes to assets dont ever waste your money on this game
5348	1	a	I just imagine it as unreal tornament 2004 with dinos 11/10
518	1	a	Kill orcs.
5566	0	a	Just wasted my money (1$ + DLC, argh). Feels like a mobile / early 2000's cheap FPS. I would rather like to play Doom (of course)
2481	1	a	A good game. Entertaining, Beutiful And- DINOSAURS! The maps are well made. The game is extremelly fun, though lacks a large player base. Deserves more than its current meta score for sure.
2910	1	a	The reviews are very misleading as they were reviewing a dfferent game... This game is pretty fun and right now its only a dollar so grab it and have fun with some friends
6263	1	a	It's very fun game to be played with friends. But the aiming is not quite good. Need more improvements. 
5904	0	a	The game is on the verge of being likable which is what makes it worse.
4926	1	a	Use to be free for a weekend costed 4.99 (or 0.99) then now Free to play...         NO MONEY WASTED! :D
4192	1	a	I paid a $1 Can't Complain
1087	1	a	great game, challenging, but not impossible :)
313	1	a	Great physics game that gets progressively harder in single player tower defense action. Weilding your crossbow, you fight a army of orcs attempting to survive them and find out what is happening. Owning this game and the second gives you classic levels in the first one as well. Recommend if you get the second orcs must die for the complete story and extra levels with friends.
2470	1	a	It would appear to be a work in progress. For one dollar this game is amazing. Full price though..... I do like that the developers seem intent on adding content without charging the user for it. I like to support the little guy and this is a good game.
6116	1	a	Short and simply put, ORION is a game developed by people clearly concerned with their consumers having fun. If you can get the game on sale, convince some friends to pick it up, or snag a bundle. At a good price, the game is worth the one night of fun you would get at minimum. The weapons are interesting, the combat is hectic and the maps large. The only real complaint that I have is that it is too hard to earn credits to buy better guns, abilities, and in some maps and game types, vehicles.
3135	1	a	Got a giant Mech to ride on top of a helicopter, 10/10.
46	1	a	i cant even play i lod it up and it crashed ugh pls fix thx
5774	1	a	For its price, it's absolutely a crime not to purcahse it
4328	1	a	Basically dino D-Day but in the future, and with more tanks. Gameplay is janky and hard to follow, and the majority of the weapons make no sense to use, even for fun. But it's good fun, again don't pay retail for it
279	1	a	I like this game! This is basically a tower defense + third person shooter, similar to Sanctum, but with a much better sense of humor and style, and doesn't give me motion sickness. Within the first five minutes of playing, I quickly felt inclined to play through the rest, which is a rare experience these days.   There's a good progression, as the game starts to get noticeably harder in the final levels. There is a nightmare difficulty once you beat the game on normal, for an even harder challenge. Every level you're presented with a new trap or item, but I found myself not using most of them, having tried them out and finding them less effective than existing gear. Since every level offers up to 5 stars, replay is fairly good for those striving for the most reward out of each level.  Well worth the asking price, especially on a sale. I hear the recently released sequel is even better, so I look forward to that.
5281	0	a	I tried it for 20 minutes and I want my 20 minutes back.  I wanted to give it a chance to see if it felt like a good shooter. It doesn't feel like a good anything. Even if it was a real piece of human excrement, it wouldn't feel like a good piece of human excrement. The weapons have ridiculous recoil, but sound more like stapleguns. I could forgive the late 90's graphics if the game had a good feel to it, but they couldn't even come close to the combat feel of something like Goldeneye.  On sale for 74 cents, eh? Free would be too expensive.
2921	1	a	I bought this game for 39 pence simply to extend my library and to have something to entertain me for about 20 minutes. What acctually happened was I spent 80 minutes having one of the most fun experiences in multiplayer gaming. The people I played with were extremley fun and helpful, no trolls or spams or anything like that. I only played the game with strangers but I imagine there is also more fun to be had with freinds. I'm about to find out actually, I just bought this game for three of my friends and we are going to paly it to death.  If I was to give this game a score out of 10 so far it would be an 8. I was happily surprised by this game.
5550	0	a	call of oblivion: the taken assets
6105	1	a	I more or less bought this game basically because the name has 'Dino Horde' in it. I expected it to be completely ridiculous. It is completely ridiculous, but it can be addicting. I mean, what really makes this game worth it is that there is a mode where you can play as the dinosaurs and kill other playable people. I like that. It is hard to get used to at first and they overwhelm you quickly (regular horde mode), but if you play with a group, it is enjoyable.
4854	1	a	This is cool. U did gr8 m8 20/10.
5763	1	a	I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO OTHERS. IT IS AWESOME.
5621	0	a	I bought this game as 'Orion: DIno Horde'. Now, the dev has re-released it under yet a new name, and before I got it the game was Orion:Dino Beatdown. The good: A wave based survival game you can play with friends co-op. The bad: Most of the vehicles seem lifted from Halo, the dev keeps pulling and re-uploading the game to make negative reviews vanish, and now for their latest game they wholesale lifted assets from other developers and got caught, and are throwing a fit. Avoid this game to now reward them for their behavior, avoid the dev. I regre that I cannot refund it at this time due to getting too many hours into it.
6394	1	a	Call of duty fans unite and kill dino's
3029	1	a	this game just has the best 'cost/benefit ratio' a game ever had
1299	1	a	So good ,I like game cartoon graphic!  10/10 In the BEST â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5597	0	a	I am sure it is a great game but my computer would not hold it and I have a great computer! So I would not recommend it. Waste of $0.49! May aswell give money to homeless! 2/10
2480	1	a	This game has changed A LOT since release. What was once a shoddy, broken game is now one of the most jam-packed, jaw-dropping experiences I've ever encountered in a game. Not only does it have literally every game mode I could ever want it's only $15.  Do you like Dinosaurs? GET IT. Do you like PLAYING as Dinosaurs? It has 4 (soon to be 10). Do you like tons of guns? Game has 50+. Do you like cooperative gaming with friends? 4 coop modes. Do you like competitive multiplayer? It has like 10 modes!  200+ achievements, 30+ maps, I don't know how, even in it's worst state, this game was so knocked. Seriously check it out at the next f2p event or sale.
3985	0	a	Just no no stop looking at, yeah you dont even for a second think of buying this turn around and go buy something else this is not worth time, Download, Hard drive space, or anything. Trex mechs no noooooooooooooooooooooooo 
1647	1	a	If you enjoy the concept of games as art than this could be for you. I find it to be one of those games I can get lost in for a few 15 minute sessions here and there. There are some points where it's either over the top difficult or because of the power ups you've achieved it's too easy but those moments in between are great fun.
1392	1	a	Alot of fun :)
1232	1	a	OMG, best game ever you will like it so much, just buy the game you will not regret buying this game
4899	0	a	Although it is much better then Dino Beatdown, it is a poor excuse for a game still.
5742	0	a	Killing dinosaurs is such a lame idea, and the game is boring.
4533	1	a	Graphics: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Performance:10/10   When I bought this game I was expecting a broken peice of crap game. HOLY &amp;%$# I was wrong This game is addictive fun and great for co-op teamwork though a few of the gamemodes and a little broken. But the makes that up with Halarious Ragdoll glitches like a T-rex doing a flip. or a Raptor freaking out halfway in the ground. This game is not something new it reminds me alot of other co-op games but thats the point of this game it's a time killer game, for say you got 40 minutes to kill. This game will eat that 40 minutes right up. My verdict is a 9/10
5451	0	a	I paid for the game and its now free. watta â¥â¥â¥â¥ move.
3341	0	a	Eh you have to have a really good powerful PC to play this game and this game is terrible.
4540	1	a	the best thing is if they will come with a dino mode where you can play as a dino vs the humans  
3703	0	a	Seriously, take the 99p you'd spend on this game during the sale and buy one of those saver menu Cheeseburgers from McDonald's. It would be more beneficial to your health than this.
2755	1	a	Absolutly love this game.  10/10  would jurassic world again.
2288	1	a	ORION: Prelude  Would totally recommend this game! It's a fun dino FPS that's great for playing with friends. You capture bases, buy weapons, get upgrades, and fight off dino hordes!  PLUS if you like getting achievements there are tons that come really easily, mostly from just casually playing the game.  Picked this up for $1.50 in the steam summer sale and would give it an 8 - 10
3934	1	a	Played it for a while and it worked perfectly fine and it was wvery entertaining. Good game. Worth the money.
3504	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
3037	1	a	one of the best dino fps ive ever played :D
765	1	a	I saw a friend of mine playing a game like this a long time ago on PS1, I never got to try it myself, forgot what it was called, but ever since then Ive been wanting a game where you could spawn all sorts of gorey traps on the walls of a castle and then let the invaders run through them. This game gives me all that, and more, more as in comedy, badassery, archery, when in doubt use fire. This is the first recommendation I've ever done, so I hope that tells you something, it's just a game for pure fun and slaughter of evil orcs.
6018	1	a	Very entertaining to play with friends a must buy for under 5$.
2266	1	a	I really love how immersive this game is, it's like a mix of jurassic park and halo came together and had a brain baby, this game is very fun and I personally recommend it.
1529	1	a	A really good puzzle game that has three different endings. Graphics and sound were ok. 8/10
3345	1	a	I've paid a lot more for games not nearly this good. Halo plus dinos.
4752	0	a	This game has some cool features but I don't think they executed their plans good enough for it to be a good game. Gunplay is terrible on this game, dinosaurs are poorly textured if you ask me. It's always the same, you can go on for ages. A little bit too easy. After all I wouldn't recommend this game, this is also the reason why it became so cheap in the first place. NO.
4435	0	a	crappy graphics not very fun to play. this game is hard to use and the gameplay trailers have probably 10x the amount of graphics than the actual game on ultra
6136	1	a	Purchased while on sale for $0.99, watching the game play videos I assumed this game would be a lag nightmare or somehow not live up to any decent expectations. It proved to be the best gaming purchase I have made in years. Even for 20x what I paid this game would be worth it, as the key to any good game it is very fun!
3672	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous, survival-based cooperative gameplay and retro-inspired Arena Combat, 'ORION: Prelude' features massive, Open World Cooperative and PvPvE.
3011	1	a	I Got killed by a T-Rex 11/10
760	1	a	'I really like this game'
3249	1	a	Hilariously fun! Only played a couple times but It's definitely worth more than a dollar
1403	1	a	Challenging but fun game with an interesting art style.
2444	1	a	Got this â¥â¥â¥â¥ when it was free and went hard as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Forgot to buy it when it was 99 cents and got â¥â¥â¥â¥ for it but I have it now and I gotta say, it's complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't get me wrong, it's fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥ but the spinosaurus is a mean â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. He'll eat you for breakfast and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you out right after. He eats those little â¥â¥â¥â¥ing raptors like a fat kid eats cheetos he found under his man-boob flabs. His health shoots up faster than a meth addict in a truck stop bathroom. The stego is an OG and is a pretty cool guy. The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trike likes to hang out with the stego and act like he knows what's up but he's really just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ nigguh. The damn crocidile thing is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ other than be in the way if you're playing as a dino. Now you may think I'm just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, but your opinion doesn't really matter you loser. All-in-all I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. Really good price for a really good game.
5475	0	a	most lagiest game ever for any indians  ping is always reaching for the skyin INDIACANNOT PLAY LOCAL CO OP if any of you buyers live INDIA pls stay away from this game as far as possible
5752	1	a	I picked up this game along time back and it was unplayable so after looking at it again what an inprovment great game good job team!
6086	1	a	Like Jeff Goldblum this game had me avoiding the toilet for many days after playing. Simple concept lots of fun.
4033	1	a	this is the best dinosour game ever creatide  
2326	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME 
1782	1	a	 https://youtu.be/YAVdF1xAj3M   The first 30 minutes of gameplay are contained in the video.  So far, BEEP is a decent platformer with some clever use of physics, but it's really not my cup of tea. I found the core platforming mechanics to be too floaty, and I don't care for the BEEP robot's design or animations.  Given that the game is an indie title and operated mostly bug-free (save for the need to change my audio channels from 8 to 6 to prevent crashing) I can give these few small complaints a pass and offer a thumbs up to fans of the genre.  One caveat, however - if you're looking for a platformer that offers something new or innovative, I don't believe that BEEP is what you're looking for.
3023	1	a	This game was suprisingly really fun. I'm not really scared of dinosaurs,  but I do scream when I see the stegosaurus running towards me. This is a game where it will sneak behind you and grab you and by  the time you look at the time, while you're trying to survive the next wave,  you will already be 3 hours late for work.  Plus- Jetpacks. This game made me see how well jetpacks and dinosaurs go together.
3389	1	a	Ever want to kill Dinosaurs?? but you never had the chance because they're dead? Well this is a game for you. All you do is just kill dinosaurs and run around doing small task and kill dinosaurs!  10/10
1133	1	a	If you like Tower defense games, this is worth the $15!! Quoting one of the Orcs 'I'm just a day away from retiring!' LOL!
3734	0	a	Game's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, but as with every game, screwing around with your friends and finding glitches in this game is fun.
4191	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ i buy this game before now it's free
4366	1	a	This game is the description of 'so bad it's good'.
4423	1	a	It will change your life for ever.
2643	1	a	If you use the weird hoverthingies you can climb over the heightlimit and go driving around the skybox. Also it had dinosours at some point. But they won't really bother you if you keep driving in circle and just not care about them.  You are a autist who likes dinosours so you will buy it even if I say that this game is worse than Hitler.  9/10 it has dinosaurs.
1368	1	a	I want Shank 3 plxxx
4705	0	a	LAG.......GY......A......S......HE.......CK.....
5443	1	a	Buy now whilst it's cheap!
964	1	a	Crazy fun action, with fun weapons, and a nice strategy element from the trap placement aspect. Also, a decent story that mostly takes a backseat to the action, but is enough to be interesting.
197	1	a	This game... the most fun I've had in ages!
5494	0	a	This game is honestly crap, the graphics suck, and so does the performance.
1764	1	a	I have been playing this game for a little while now and I would have to say it's worth purchasing. If you are into platforming games I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this.   Especially with the current sale going on it's definitely a good game to add to your library.  I did a short First Impressions video on it showing the first 10 minutes or so of the game if you're intersted.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEjDax3XFs     Social Media Twitter -  https://twitter.com/kovicplayz  Youtube -  https://www.youtube.com/kovicplayz  Twitch -  https://www.twitch.tv/kovicplayz/profile 
6395	1	a	Who knew that the best game on steam would only cost a dollar.
1657	1	a	A bit boring &amp; a bit pointless. Sorry, infinite shooter of critical acclaim ;)
3801	0	a	I just want to say tht the concept is cool, but it is kinda hard to play when the game won't stop lagging..
3058	1	a	For the price, you get a lot more than you pay for, ignoring the awkward animations and weird looking players, a bug here and there, it's a quite fun game specially with friends.
5320	0	a	Do it only as a joke to annoy whomever recieved it. Do not buy this for yourself as a great game to play.
3016	1	a	The reviews are right, this game is extremely entertaining! It's a new look to the feels I got from playing L4D2 with friends before.
396	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
4830	1	a	fun PURE FUN the objetive is survive dinos or fight in team death matchs super fun glitchy yet fun i have ther way to say it 7/10 somtimes youll get fusterrated but thats ok just keep killing enemys i recomend survivle for people that like fight a horde of what evers but you survive grab objectives and rune back or even drive back cant wait to play some more :D
114	1	a	Poker styled card attacking game...  If that hasn't sold you then i don't know what will.  Definatly a 9/10!
3161	1	a	brilliant game some graphical faults but one of the best games available in my opinion
2236	1	a	A First Person Shooter. Check! Multiplayer? Check! Upgradable Weaponry? Check! Stealth Camouflage? Check! Jetpacks? Check! Tanks, Mech-warriors and other Military Grade Equipment? Check! Oh, yes... Dinosaurs, hungry for your blood? Check!  I have not had such a lot of fun in ages. Mutiplay with friends in Co-op is awesome. You should get it just for that. 
5618	0	a	Why do people keep supporting this developer. This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The developer is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person. And they should not be able to sell a game ever again. Oh wait. But if anything negative happens towards them, they will just rename the game and/or their developing studio name and the casual audience will not even notice. This developer is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scummy it isn't even funny anymore. It never really was. And the game isn't even good. Like Fez is a good game but this game is absolute garbage. Just buy Killing Floor.
515	1	a	Possibly one of the greatest tower defence games i have ever played.
6139	0	a	I changed my mind about this game, the soldiers are perfect but the dinosaurs on the other hand get stuck on any bush it hits and it is impossible to kill any soldiers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
3879	0	a	You can get 6 cards from this game. I recommend you play the game until you get the cards, otherwise you're missing out on about six nickels' worth of value. The best way to play the game until then is to idle out in the main menu and read a book.
3298	1	a	Still learning the game but had a ton of fun with friends playing it and seeing all the features like the mechas and tanks. It's a pretty simple shoot and follow objectives kind of game that's fun in group. It's silly and has a good base but definitely room for improvement. No worries though since the developers have been working on constant fixes to bring it up standard.
495	1	a	Hilarious! A must buy for anyone who likes Bruce Campbell films or Duke Nukem!  The extra missions that you can buy are also good but lack the hilarious storyline and the new traps you get seem a bit too powerful.  The follow up game Orcs Must Die 2 is terrible! Don't waste any money on it.
354	1	a	awesome game for lovers of third person 
5228	0	a	Its Free WTF and i and have my money back :/ this steam  
3963	1	a	Possibly one of the best Survival Genre games i have ever played
3454	1	a	I love this game, better then tripple A titles such as AC Unity and Arkham Knight. 7/10.
2842	1	a	Light and fun gameplay.
2306	1	a	this is a fun game and at one point you can be a dino yourself 
5859	1	a	I just sold some cards on the marketplace and bought this game with the profits, lol. So cheap. I have played this game when it was free for a weekend. Awesome fun and well worth the 49 cent price tag.
6020	0	a	What a horrible and junk game
4044	1	a	This game is so horrible, it's awesome. The perfect choice of game to get bevved up with your mates and just screw around playing a game together. I would suggest waiting for the game to go on sale before picking it up though (Which it does frequiently enough) It's harmless fun of eating your friends as a dino and they try to shoot you in the foot.
69	1	a	This game surprised me. It is a fun combination of genres.
1870	1	a	The visuals make me think this is clearly made for a five to eight year old. That says it's a great game for a kid that age.
585	1	a	Challanging game! but a really nice tower defense!!! RECOMMENDE!!!
4945	1	a	Its a dollar, buy the freaking game. Its pretty damn good. Honestly, I think its worth 10-15, but im cheap. If you're cheap aswell, but it for a dollar.
4206	0	a	This is a Terrible UT mod. Ideas stolen from other good game out there. Changed, and made bad. Really awful animations and poor game play with extensive maps that are really boring to get around.   It sounds cool by premise, but honestly, this game sucks hard. Avoid it!
3300	1	a	Honestly, This game is actually kinda ok. People put down you pitchforks! Almost reminds me of killing floor in terms of gameplay (of course jetpacks now included) and a lot of fun can be had from this game, just not shinny sparkly graphics fun and can be repettitive at times. But seriously, this game is basicaly F2P now with its new price and the updates have seroiusly boosted my score of the game, For the price of a Yourkie at a corner shop, at least try this beacuse you kinda-maybe-hopefully wont regret it...maybe.
569	1	a	A great game if you have a cheap laptop, trying to perfect it is addicting.
6241	1	a	For only 1 euro, this game is very good. Addictive gameplay and cool weapons.  Can be a bit repetitive.  7/10
4884	1	a	For $.99, 10/10,000 BC/AC (In what year is this again?).     While flying I killed a flying dinosaur, then I landed to kil some walking dinosaurs, and then a person from the other came to sabotage our reactor/core/whatever it is and f***ed our team (but I don't care, I killed taht b***ard anyways). [/spiler]  
1913	1	a	This is a really good game ! It has some rather fun concept and might be similar to Rochard. Check it out !
4066	1	a	In other games do you run into people with vehicles and think 'man I wish that was a dinosaur' If so orion dino hoard is for you.' Do you think 'man if I could only hit a tyrannosaurus in the face with a laser sword yelling 'Boink' everytime you hit them? If so Orion Dino Hoard is for you. If you never want to know why in the heck dinosaurs friggin love power generators soo much, then Orion Dino Hoard is for you.  
5995	1	a	Watched my friend run around a mountain being chased by a t-rex while I was invisible. 8/10
1890	1	a	Don't shy away just because it may not look as detailed as other games- this can be hours of fun!
2693	1	a	Good buy, a little expensive though
3699	0	a	Unfortunately I was not able to play this game; when it would get to class selection, it would lock up. I couldn't even ALT-TAB out of it, as it was holding the rest of the computer hostage.  It isn't as though I don't have a beefy machine though:  Intel Core i3 CPU with 4 processors nVidia GeForce GTX560 OC video card 8 GB of RAM (unfortunately, 32 bit Windows 7, so 3.45 GB available)  I may try this again later, but not interested right now.
1583	1	a	Very good Tower Defense game, probably the best on steam, great replayability and fun.  9.5/10
5202	0	a	Even free it's not worth it.
3315	1	a	This game is entertaining and fun. You get to shoot dinosaurs. It's not the most fluid game I've ever played, but it's well worth the money.  7/10.
1220	1	a	It\'s hard but fun.
2884	1	a	not historically accurate, stegosauruses (stegosauri) were pacifists and did not partake in violence.
3686	1	a	This game is very good, you have dinosaurs and â¥â¥â¥â¥, very dramatic. I like, good weapons, strong and powerful. It is game for real men and fake women
2327	1	a	This game, like others have said, is a mixture of Halo and Left 4 Dead in gameplay, with maybe something else thrown in. My computer runs Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and Team Fortress 2 just fine, but for some reason, struggles with this game. I had to lower the graphics settings in-game to their lowest just to even get close to a decent performance. And even then, I didn't find the game that fun. I can see its potential, though. It's just not working for me personally. So my recommendation only comes half-heartedly, but only because I don't think it would be fair to say I don't recommend the game.
230	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce! Bathe in that stuff youngster... it'll keep you sharp and youthful inside long past the point where hope and happiness fades into a bitter diy tincture that doesn't heal the wound that won't close... yes.... a most excellent orc genocide simulator! Bonus creatures included for happy end!! and it had a very good sequel also! :D
1258	1	a	It's like a tower defense, but you play it as a third person game. You still build up various types of defensive mechanisms that help you prevent the enemy from getting to your base. It feels fresh and innovative, while not consuming too much of your time if you don't want it to. Good for a simple time passer or playing for a long time.
2816	1	a	Best game I ever bought for $0.75
4541	1	a	I have this game from 2013. This is my review. -2 million copies sold becouse game is good and only cost 0.79â¬ (for me idk for dollars) -good snipers -while being downed don't need player to get you up.just kill dinosaur! :D -skins for pistol? i perfer golden one. :D or magma -Customizing charachter and showing middle finger as taunt :D -Can be Fps and third person -i didn't play 2 weeks game and i accidently got 12k. Was that helpful to buy game? Maybe
5739	0	a	My computer couldn't handle this one sorry it seems cool tho
4971	1	a	This is my preferated game.
3709	0	a	This game sucks in every way.
3260	1	a	I nominate this game for: I only had 50 cents left award, cause you know ......MOAR GAMES
5238	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6039	1	a	Stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a Lightsaber  10/10
293	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
5898	0	a	Whats the objective? what are the controls? lets find out *mashes all the buttons one by one*
5030	1	a	Savage Dino and Reptile killing simulator 2016    Best game..
4250	0	a	this game is stupid
4564	1	a	nice game for the price :)
2409	0	a	its 99p for a reason. Don't expect a good result.
4779	1	a	Things I got to do on Dino Horde: 1) Mech fight with a Stegosaurus 2) Knife fight with a Triceratops 3) Ride a TRex while shooting smaller dinosaurs from it's back  Why is this game rated so damned low?  Be interesting to see what happens if/when modders get ahold of it?
762	1	a	Think of a tower defence game with a controlable hero. Now replace towers with 100 other cool ways to kill an orc. (like a bladed vacuum that tears fools to shreds) Boom there ya go.  No real story, but that's not really the aim of the game. Just kill â¥â¥â¥â¥.
910	1	a	A very fun game that has the best sense of humor since Portal! I first thought OMD! was a low-quality indie game, but it is actually a fantastically made, very well-presented title! The graphics and art style are gorgeous, the animations are flowing, the controls are super smooth, and the traps and sound effects are very impactful (pun intended). Basically, the art, sound, and controls outdo many AAA titles! Plus the humor, wow, this game is truly hilarious. I laughed so many times at the quirky humor. Although the defense aspect isn't super strategic and does rely on trial and error, it is very fun nevertheless. Plus, I love that I can employ my quick reflexes and twitch gaming skills to headshot Orcs left and right. Unlike other defense games where you often indirectly fight, there's always something to set up, shoot, or blow up. Overall, OMD! is nonstop carnage, mayhem, and hilarity! A true gem for fans of defense games, third-person action, and quality humor!
2553	1	a	This game is highly innovative, interesting, and highly original.  I enjoyed it, and is definately worth cheching out.
5012	1	a	Cheap and fun.
2422	1	a	Drove car into an alligator and blew up. 10/10
5347	1	a	Great game, the survival mode in single player is the best part. Dino's and Guns! How could that not be at least a little fun. Worth the price!
2008	1	a	I bought this game at 96% off for the cards, and expected it to be terrible.   After playing it, however, it's actually quite fun.  Personally, I feel like I've robbed the devs at Â£0.15.
306	1	a	Orcs Must Die, what are you waiting for? buy the game, or no, hold on, now that hte second one is out buy the second one.
4246	1	a	IT GOOOD GAME PLS BUY DO IT 200$ PLS OR I KILL YOU MY TIGGA
4380	1	a	I love this game a bit laggy if u play on a laptop with pretty nice graphics but still awesome
2197	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
3657	1	a	The sheer amount of content in ORION: Prelude is impressive. Not just all the equipment and weapons that you'd expect but also lightsabres, portable turrets, jetpacks, bows and arrows, not to mention the vehicles, from jeeps to tanks, planes and walkers, like the developers decided to make the game as purely fun as possible, and they succeeded in a big way.
4995	1	a	I may only have 0.2 hours on this game but let me tell you that with it being a mix of like Halo and a dinosaur game it is that good. rate 10/10 best $1.50 on the sale ive ever spent
567	1	a	Definitely one of the coolest tower defense-like games. It didn't take long before the levels started getting a little more difficult (in terms of trying to achieve all 5 skulls per level). There's also a Nightmare mode that is even more difficult.
1786	1	a	Best 19cents ive spent in awhile.
553	1	a	Incredibly fun, but takes a little while to get into. At first it seems like you just plow away with your crossbow, but it quickly becomes about strategy. Very entertaining graphics and physics. Gameplay is very fun, and yet still challenging. I highly recommend this game if you're into Tower Defense games.  Other games like this are Sanctum (1 and 2) and Dungeon Defenders. All of these are great games, and the FPS/TPS slash Tower Defense genre really needs more games.
996	1	a	this game is a tower defense with some perks too it. dope
5294	1	a	Hey everybody so I played this game and I'm impressed it's very good and haters gonna hate saddly I stoped playing because I'm on a laptop and my graphics card sux and It's laggy alot and I really mean ALOT but yea I recommend this game and it's under one dollar
1477	1	a	This is the best 2d action game I have been played. Very very good for playing with friend or your brother.
5073	1	a	Nice game
6293	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! BUGGY beyond beleief. Fun once you get it working, and in game, but until they fix a bunch of the problems, dont buy. 3/10
4261	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking, â¥â¥â¥â¥ programming, could have been great
3628	1	a	A Dino? Go Get my sniper rifle!
3740	0	a	Just no.
5105	1	a	You can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and machine guns. 11/10 - IGN
6149	1	a	Yolo
5131	1	a	best, good game, idled for cards
2169	1	a	The Devs are extremely devoted to this game, and after seeing what they have in store for this game, i have nothing but gratitude towards these guys. I used to have a bad opinion of them after seeing some bad news on them, but it seems to have been nothing more than some raging internet idiot posting lies. I say get the game, and since it goes on sale so much for $1, you shouldn't have much financial problems from picking this up. What the devs have in store (Orion Prelude) looks amazing, and they'll evolve the current game into a much more beautiful and refined game for FREE. The devs are also producing free dlc, nothing you have to pay for. If anything, it would be the dev's devotion and effort to build this game into something beautiful and amazing that caught my attention and encouraged me to recommend this game.  tl;dr - Great game, great devs
251	1	a	Got it on sale, it is a great game to play when you are frustrated and need to calm down. I have 9 hours and am not even half way through, but I think I might be because I will only go to the next level if I get a perfect score.   I got it on sale, but I'd say it is worth the $10.
5119	1	a	Really good....but really weird!!!
4035	1	a	This game is probably the best game on steam for 99 cents. It has really unique graphics, and stuff. However, there was one glaring problem-- I don't know if it's just for my computer but I keep on getting a connection lost message even though I can play CS:GO for 3 hours with no wifi errors, as far as I know. If you know what's going on, please reply.
1663	1	a	'we need to go deeper!'  An infinitely procedurally generated word. Infinite in the scope of a human lifetime.  Go into enemies to make them weaker, go into power ups to make them stronger.   Like 'Inception', except, it NEVER ends.   Insanely difficult, and hard to manage where you are. Very interesting, and majorly rewarding when you finally get to a place and plant your flag in a place NO HUMAN has ever been.  7.5/10 Try, a must if you like shooters or very interesting indies.
1646	0	a	Interesting concept and gameplay but nothing there to make you want to continue playing after an hour.
3895	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde is a dinosaur survival game. If youve ever played nazi zombies or extintion then this is like it. You have a certain ammount of dinos to kill each round. Overall a fun game worth playing. 
4122	1	a	I bought this game for two of my friends and I.  Now all three of us hate me.
3587	1	a	Really enjoy this game, they've hit on a great formula; especially the co-op conquest maps. It's one of those games with a very simple concept done flawlessly. Graphics are great too, I have a fairly old graphics card and this runs nice and smooth at full res.  Vehicles are great, the ballistic tank weapon is great. It's fun. I really like how when you go up levels you have a decent starting weapon too.
2056	1	a	I thought this game was an excellent little playthrough and provided a good solid 5 hours of game time. Well worth the puzzle-like problem solving that the game required to collect all the items for each world. I would love to see a continuation of the game in the future.
2741	1	a	This game is somewhat like mixing CoD: BO with dinosaurs. You work together with teammates who help you in return with getting the giant T-Rex down for new weapons/attributes that you unlock with EXP and 'CRDT', gained after killing any reptilian creature that attacks you first. It needs lots of development, more weapons than JUST pistols but it has potential. Good luck devs!
4245	0	a	Wow they made the game worse. Gimme back my dollar!
2673	1	a	Do you like Science Fiction? Do you like Dinosaurs? Do you have a Dollar? If you answered yes to these questions, get the game!
4790	1	a	It's certainly fun, however at the moment the current playerbase (very small majority but enough to notice) is either rude or constantly being vulgar towards (usually new) other players. -- hopefully the movement over to Free-to-Play will settle this down since there will be new players almost every day.  Otherwise, I recommend.   NTM it's going F2P, support it while you can.
4105	1	a	Bearing in mind the price of this game, it's pretty okay!!
1093	1	a	Its a cool game my friend gave it for my bd :D 
2212	0	a	its not worth 1$

1243	1	a	I am having a blast. planning and shooting required, fun granted
4411	0	a	Horrible game. The guns feel horrible like they aren't doing anything. The devs say that they've improved the game, I would argue that they made it worse. The jetpack DOESNT work off the jump. The gun skins feel just thrown in.
2344	1	a	Very fun game! Great Co-op style and is like fighting a militia.
3728	0	a	I tried this when it was a free to try for x number of days. To me it wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't for me. It plays like a 3D tower defense game if you play solo. Which I dislike tower defense games. It has a lot of VS modes which gives it a lot of competative game play options. Which again is not what I was looking for out of the game. It looks like halo with dinosaurs but doesn't play as such.
6420	1	a	I watched my best friend get triple teamed by a triceratops, a t rex, and a stegosaurus. To be fair, they might have been provoked by the rockets he was firing from his mech suit. The best use to date of the unreal engine and 75 cents.    HOW HAVE YOU NOT BOUGHT THIS YET?!?!?!?!?!
3641	1	a	If theres anyway to describe this game, it certainly is no Dinosaur on a technical level. With Hi-Tech Dino-Devonian physics,Cretaceolicious level design, an Jurrasictastic story, and Jaw dropping Weapon Array. There's certainly no going wrong with Orion: Dino Horde/Prelude especially for the outrageous asking price. 8/10
3493	1	a	I r8 8/8 m8 Totally worth my 50 cents
592	1	a	If you love trap games + tower defense, or just miss the old 'Dungeon Keeper' franchise, this is one game you should not miss playing! 'Hands-on' Dungeon Keeper!
3777	1	a	This game is amazing! for the price and download time it is the best hoard game I have played!

2233	0	a	This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usally found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game  just  went below average.
6380	1	a	I Loved The Game And Now Knowing That People Really Liked It Means That I Will Not Be The Only One Playing It In Years To Come. And In One Word Thanks.
3403	1	a	this game is everything i was looking for
3729	0	a	This game is terrible.
1179	1	a	This game is fun and awesome.
2074	1	a	Seriously, if you were paying 0.99$ for it, then why are you expecting a 29.99$ game ?  As lots of you may have known that there are some bugs and immature 3D imaging issues, including shooting delay and broken graphics, but I actually have had a lot of fun in it.  Killing dinos with friends is simply fun, with various choices of maps and gameplay mode. If you don't see it as a dedicated gun game, you'll probably make it easier to enjoy.  In short, personally, paying 0.99$ for a 200-hrs+ game, that was just worth enough to me. Would like to see how this game improve in the future.  ORION: Prelude [7/10]

4647	1	a	Awesome game! I was able to get it for â¬0.99 and I have to admit that the game is really worth it!  I love playing this with a bunch of friends, good times! :)
4011	1	a	very fun game  i would recomend it to my friends
539	1	a	i hate tower defence games, but this game is amazing.  this is the best tower defence game ever made, hands down.  the goal is simple, keep enemies from getting from point a to point b. you use elements to help you do such, like place and remove all sorts of different traps that do all sorts of different things. use all sorts of different weapons and spells/magic.  if you have never played or seen this game before, buy it. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  i have over 1000+ games that i own and play...not to mention games ive owned in the past on consoles. this is by far in my top 3 favorites, maybe even number 1.  so even if you are like me, and hate tower defence games, give this a try.
1739	1	a	this is great indie game ever..that reason why i love play indie than else
2328	1	a	Probably the worst game I have ever played. 69/11
6146	1	a	Though the old version of this game was not a well-liked game, this one is quite the oppposite. It's not fantastic, but it certainly is for paying $0.99! I'm not saying it isn't fun, because it certainly is, but it simply does not have as much content as more expensive games. But thta's why those games are more expensive. Overall, I like the GUI, except the buttons could be labeled for PC gamers as well (in the menu, it shows A and B button indicators for console), and the HUD could use more concise labeling. I had trouble telling which bar was which. It is a fun game, and I plan on playing it for a while.
1255	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome. No, really. Try the demo. Awesome tower defense gameplay coupled with great hack 'n' slash, burn 'n' bash combat.  If you think the demo is awesome, wait until you hear this: a little less than one third of the way into the campaign, you unlock the Weavers, performance enhancing mages who let you choose a tree of enhancements: your weapons, or your traps (this includes guardians and soldiers). Personally I'm a fan of the combat enhancements. With the double ended bladestaff, and all the melee enhancements, you'lll tear through the orc hordes like a hurricane of blood.   I've tried the Trap tree, but because both traps and the perks cost money, where as with the combat you only have to pay for the perks, I find that the trap tree often takes longer to upgrade, and even with the perks you'll often still have to depend on weapons a fair amount.  All in all, this game kicks â¥â¥â¥. Buy it.
3901	1	a	It's like Battlefield, except with Dinosaurs.

2733	1	a	i love this game so much!
3311	1	a	it is like Orion: Dino Beatdown only worth the price
4018	1	a	halo + dinos = 8/10   Never pay full price for this game, buggs out too much. That being said really fun.
550	1	a	Woo! I love tower defense!
98	1	a	If you like Alternative RPGs, this is a greeeeaaat one, as good as puzzle quest 1, different though. cool game,.
3102	1	a	better than what you pay for it
1850	1	a	It's now become a running joke between my friends whenever it goes on sale  10/10 would joke about bad game again
3681	1	a	This is a great game but I feel that the fight to survive feature is not good because you CANNOT kill a dino with a pistol.But still the game rocks :D
4930	1	a	Everyone needs to buy this game!!! It's amazing, and should be sold for much more then $1!!!
750	1	a	Tower defense based concept, and great if you're looking for instant action. Choose your character/weapons/traps; kill Orcs and keep them away from the rift!
2438	0	a	I played this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.Bad graphic
1214	1	a	An educational game for the entire family.
4166	0	a	This game needs to make it's mind up weather it's a free 2 play, or a payed game.
19	0	a	As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half right  It seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.  You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.  The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean â¥â¥â¥â¥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.  The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.  Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.
4716	1	a	it's a game that's all :D
3977	1	a	damm this game is just superb for 79 cents itÂ´s worth it , if you buy it longside with friends and you play with them itÂ´s a really funny game
