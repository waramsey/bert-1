3912	1	a	Love this game!
2356	1	a	one dollar is well fukken cheap for good game... but then THEY DISCOUNT IT INTO HALF.  I mean, even it's cheaper than I buy coffee without the cup and sugar!  10/10 good game, best price.  np: even now I feel guilty when buying this at halved price.
2467	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
4534	0	a	I dont realy like this game, the graphics..nah not that good.Best graphics since Atari 2600 :/ the gameplay, more like â¥â¥â¥â¥ play.the idea of hunting dinosaurs in the future,what i thought they were dead.sorry 2/10 :/
5109	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
6010	0	a	Only good part of this game is buying a vehicle and racing your friends. The dinosaurs are â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1379	1	a	Shank 2 puts you in the role of shank , looking for redemption and justice you fight countless enemies in your path with brutal weapons, machetes,shanks,pistols,shotguns and even grenades. The game lacks on enemy variety and combos you're pretty much doing the same attacks every single time. The graphics of this game are like it's predecesor very well done but not great. The story is pretty dull and the characters involved barely have any personality or screen time to develop themselves. There's a ton of unlockables which mainly consists of costumes for single player. The co-op of this game is enjoyable at first but unless you're really into being a perfectionist you won't even care for a second run.
1878	1	a	I wasn't sure if I should spend 21 cents on a game that I might only play for 5 minutes to write a review on, so I looked around and found a few nickels and dimes on the floor.  Sure beats spending 25 cents on a bubblegum and I even came out with 4 more cents to my name.  10/10 would find change on the floor again
5543	0	a	i payed for this game and now its free to play, i want my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money back
4836	0	a	This game is so broken it hurts.The dinosaurs glitch around,the animation is garbage,the game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my high-end PC on the lowest setting,and the fps keeps dropping and increasing every five seconds.Really don't buy it.Buy ORION instead.It's better in every way
4478	0	a	It's alright for like 20 minutes at a time but gets boring pretty quick and it's hard to look past the gleaming flaws to actually enjoy it. Needs lots of work.   The price of a game is irrelevant, the fact that it's less than $1 doesn't excuse a broken game, too many lazy devs these days seem to think so though.
309	1	a	Great game ,easy at first but harder at the end ,  lots of cool items and traps , the only thing i miss in a multipalayer mode/map
6296	1	a	Bought this game back when it was a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Mad respect to the company for sticking with it, especially when most companies would've ditched it. Deserves your dollar just for that.
5843	0	a	More bugs than Goat Simulator
1769	1	a	Cute, Lame, Old Fashion Game, Puzzle, Little Action, Child-ish I give it a 6/10 Still under my recommendations
3262	1	a	Do you want fun? This is funny. You can laugh with or at it. The game lack a story? Narrate a creative one while you play at a random server or with your friends. At first glance the game may look stupid, but even though a second look reveals the same opinion, this is still worth playing. I wish there to be more friendly and helpful players, so the community can grow lively and strong.  Edit: Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I do really enjoy playing it. Is this game bad? Yes, it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing is. I laugh at the poorly opmized game with clunky gameplay. But I do wish it was good and well made, with more time dedicated to it. But the developer left it to rot and went on another project that is an even worst clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥. I wanted this game to be something I could give to my friends and enjoy with them. But it is buggy and most of the fun comes from laughing at the game and not with it.  I still recomend it though. Even more now that it is free to play. Hope one day it will be open source and the players will be able to directly contribute to good development of this great concept and visionary idea for a game.
4050	1	a	10/10 I saved a dudes life by quickscoping a Pterodactyl. Then I turned around at lightening speed and quickscoped a baby Velociraptor 300 feet away. This game is awesome!
5748	0	a	I payed $1 for this game then it became free
1409	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
5858	1	a	For 50 cents, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, not a bad game.
6104	1	a	First wave I played my head got chewed off by a T-Rex.  1O/10
1120	1	a	wow what a good game
4800	1	a	Have you ever wanted to shotgun a T-rex in the face and fly away with a jetpack only to realise that he has the ability to bite the ground and throw it at you? Oh, you're in for a treat in this one...
4080	1	a	Definetly a good co-op game for 99 cents
5623	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Congrats for stealing from other's work.   
4417	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
2316	1	a	Super fun game the score is very deciving its super fun!!!
1465	1	a	Awesome sequel, this game is everything the first was with just a little bit of updating and better animation. Survival mode is addictive , fun and challenging. Really hoping for a 3rd game in the series.
757	1	a	As I Write This Very Review....And I hear The Gates being seiged by the foul Hourde. I look around at my Current Defences simi confident that they will hold againts the comming storm. Even though I have a storm of emotions rolling inside me I determine one thing............ORS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2545	1	a	got this on sale for a dollar and it's like going to burger king and finding out you're the 1 billionth customer and they shower you in triple whoppers made of REAL MEAT  8/10 wish i had friends for hamburgers and dinos ;_;
3583	1	a	I think this game is the best dinosaur game besides primal carnage 
3329	1	a	So I had no idea about this game just that someone called it Killing Floor with Dinosaurs in past. Got surprised by it's low Meta score so went on YT to check review of Cynical Brit which was full of rage and hate. Followed by this I went ingame to actually try the game ready to experience utter garbage product but...  .. after understanding beginner's confusement (mechanics, level system, classes, perks and weapons) the game actually became a fun o.0  It IS Killing Floor with dinosaurs.. and vehicles (Woo). There is more modes (including one where you play as Dinosaurs against players) but the most common is Survival -&gt; 10 waves of defending, where every 3 waves you need to go to secure the outer outpost for better vehicles/choppers, healing/reviving team mates and repairing vehicles while being swarmed by tons of meat-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Simply if you have so low expectation of this game it can surprise you (hopefully) + only for 2,7 Euros.. bah.
4343	1	a	that game iss very fun
2750	1	a	Game sorts problems out for you: 10 year old kid was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around not doing anything and spamming down the mic so a Pterodactyl swooped down, grabbed him and flew off with him into the sunset whilst he was screaming down the mic for us to get him down. 10/10 would watch 10 year old be abducted by prehistoric bird/dinosaur again.
3211	1	a	A good game and it plays very well for the size of the game
5299	1	a	The deinstallation works fine. 10/10
120	1	a	So.Very.Fun  There is nothing more to say, this game is amazing fun and I really don't understand why everyone does not play it.
5044	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.. It doesn't ever want to work whenever i start it up. It loads for a second then stops working when i try to play solo. It also doesn't let me join any online games. 0/10 no joke.... i paid money for a game that should be F2P since it doesn't work 
1408	1	a	Fun and crap.
2929	1	a	Great game
5656	0	a	This game is realeased for 3 times. Why would you expect that this game is GUD. I buy it for a cents CENTS last year, its not worth it. Dont even bother this game.
6317	0	a	its not that good at all
6449	1	a	This game has so much potential! Fun to play!
2659	1	a	Well worth the money, quite a bit of ridiculous fun. wave based dinosaur survival game with limited shopping between waves. can also buy power-ups and turrets not just guns.
3848	1	a	This game has rose from the ashes. When I first got it the game was buggy AF. But now the game is fun.
169	1	a	There is: -Deadly Orcs -Some really deadly Orcs -Orc friends to are trying to kill you -Lots of killing -Lots of traps for said killing -Lots of ways to lay said traps -Lots of options for said ways And lastly, -One crazy witch  Need I say more?  GET IT.
435	1	a	Great Game, the people who made Shadow of Mordor make they're own version!
3452	1	a	Well worth it's price tag of $1. It has Dinos and guns! That's all you need. Dinos come at you in hordes/waves and you fight them off.
4112	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
2935	1	a	Shootin dinos is fun. Nuff said.
3174	1	a	I bought this game for pennies, way back when it was a pile of junk. I was amazed when I logged in a few months ago and it looked completely redone. Are there strange physics glitches? Occasionally? Are the dinosaurs a little stupid? Absolutely. However, the game is one where you can play the game because its core is good, and you are happy to see the game actually be good, perform well, and have a decent level of graphic fidelity. 7/10 in my book, a real recovery. Just look at the cost and ask yourself, why not? 
665	1	a	By far the most entertaining and inventive ego-shootish game I have played in the last couple of years.   Players having a knack for frantic, challenging, but nevertheless highly strategic action, HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY.
5736	0	a	It's not worth it
2866	1	a	I'll be honest here I thought this game was gonna be a cheese buy like the game Bad Rats.  But honestly this game is a load of fun even by yourself.  I mean who doesn't love killing dinosaurs with guns?!  Also this game is super fun with friend's so bring them along as well!
5382	1	a	very meme
543	1	a	This is honestly one of the funnest games i have EVER played. A smart man with $15.00 would buy it. Good story, GREAT gameplay. Awesome visuals. This game is a 10/10 in my book. Will be buying any sequals.
3387	1	a	This game is as terrible as its metacritic score, Steam should be ashamed for selling this junk...
5005	1	a	awesome game love it
2554	1	a	Really fun and enjoyable game with a great price!Of course it was down to 1$ for like a week but still 11$ is worth it!I had some fun playing this game and I will propably play a lot during the summer.Now I have to focus on my exams and I don't play videogames a lot :p
1886	0	a	very boring
1174	1	a	This is without a doubt the best tower defense game I've played. Lots of fun, and the one liners add a lot of humour.
3565	1	a	6/10
3056	1	a	What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥
1892	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
6051	0	a	i played it a little bit didnt really like it. i think it needs some more work
2200	1	a	Shooting raptors while flying through the air in a jetpack. Sniping pterodactyls on top of mountians. Driving tanks head-on into battle against a giant alligator. And best of all, flying a VTOL through the air, laying down covering fire for a teammate trying to make it to the base. 10/10 best buck I ever and ever will spend.
1327	1	a	Buy the game. There's a part in it where you rip out the jaws of a SHARK!!!!?!&gt;?!??!?!?!??!@#&gt;?@!&gt;?#?@!?$@ !#$
4352	1	a	Make the large dino spawn to 400%, huge clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥. People except you healing the generator, no problem. Guy goes afk for most of time and then comes back, takes your â¥â¥â¥â¥ Nice game to play with â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiots  10/10 would call someone a jew again.
4706	1	a	This game is okay...   16 Hours worth of okay. 
2709	1	a	This game is awesome first off. Its a little broken in some places but theres tons of cool weapons, good graphics, awesome action and punching dinos in the face. If you have a couple of dollars you should really consider getting this game.
3884	0	a	Before this huge update, the game was fun and I enjoyed it. But now I'm experiencing a lot of frame drops, bugs and other gui problems. Seems to me like this version was not tested enough and released too early.
3008	1	a	Halo Clone [check]   Halo Clone with Dinosaurs [check]  that's all folks, not the best game out there, but for 99cents, its well worth it. Highly Recommend to play it with your friends since the servers, well sucks  6/10
5100	1	a	I Paid for this game when it was first released and now it's free to play. No Bonuses for buying it either.. Thanks....  Game play is good though.
2992	1	a	Simply the best survival game I've played combat is great and the visual effects are great ! Could add some more weapons and some smother maps to maneuver on that would be more grassy or have more trees in them giving that prehistoric feel ! Playing with friends is easy and great fun... This game deserves a 10/10 from me !
1537	1	a	Great game, nice mechanics. Few skills that work together perfectly. Just the final boss is a slapp in the face because it requires hardly any skill but mostly just dumb luck.
5484	1	a	I got a dino boner after playing this. Now my wife loves me again. Thank you devs!
6265	1	a	this game is just awesome.i kill all of my friends as a spino.
4882	1	a	absoolutsly awsome, i would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes action packked FPS games
1278	1	a	
166	1	a	Sometimes I almost feel bad for the orcs. Except, not really
1073	1	a	This game is surprisingly fun.
1433	1	a	Shank 2 is a great followup to the original boasting good action and a fun amount of fighting. The story and theme is set more around a tropical place as Shank tries to help overthrow the corrupt mafia with some help from others. The cutscenes usually boast more amounts of action and bloody gore than dialogue fromo the first, fitting for a good action movie. The fighting mechanics have also been beefed up with a more robust system enabling longer combos and more launchers along with new weapons along with some returning ones. Visually the game looks as great as the first with its animated style along with a great backing soundtrack. With an action movie charm, Shank 2 is great for players of the first or those wanting a fun beat em up experience.
4798	1	a	Sure, pick it up for a buck. It's broken, buggy, surface-functionable, and someohw the only game with a decent damn flamethrower, but it's HILARIOUS to start up a survival game with max $ and max dinos. It's like playing superman with no moral restrictions!
485	1	a	One of the most addictive Tower Defense games out there! Packed with action, with a variety of traps, spells and weapons to dispose of the Orcish hordes. The game leaves it's tools in our hands and the result is immensely rewarding!
1991	1	a	super awesome for relaxing 11/10
1744	1	a	I'll preface this by saying i paid almost nothing for this game expecting a game that wouldn't really be worth much.  What I got was a game that i've already played more than any of the AAA titles I have in my library in the past year.  Love the game, it's definately something you will like if you're into casual or puzzle type games. could see myself enjoying it even if I paid full price.
178	1	a	Very fun action/tower defense game. The dialog and animations are funny, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is thrilling. Not like any other TD I have ever played.
2571	1	a	I don't know what you guys are talking about because it's even worth 15$ But one dollar I don't how they make money. But it's a good game. 
1974	1	a	Absolutely perfect! If I don't have to sleep I'd play it until morning. :) // Kesinlikle mÃ¼kemmel!! Uyumak zorunda olmasam sabaha kadar oynardÄ±m bu indirime kaÃ§Ä±rmayÄ±n. :))
5420	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
887	1	a	This is a game that I consistently come back to.  Orcs Must Die is a 3rd person action tower defense game. You are given a countdown timer to run and place your objects, road blocks, and towers before the doors break down and a horde of Orcs, Goblins, Kobalds, Ogres and more come storming through. It's up to you a battlemage to use your spells and wepaons to stop them from running into a portal that takes them into your kingdom.   After a certain level, you unlock Weavers which give your character special bonuses and skill trees. To an extent it's a level-by-level RPG as well. You choose from a backpack of skills and utilities that you have hot keyed to your 1-9 keys.   I got this game for $3.74 during a special, but I'd recommend it at full price no matter what. It's really worth it.  This game has no multi-player, however Orcs Must Die 2 is multi-player.
209	1	a	Quality tower defense game (minus the towers). It's got traps, it's got shootan, it's got pretty funny jokes, and a buttload of content really.  Mindless fun.
4972	1	a	Halo + COD + Destiny + Battlefield + Dino Day = Orion: Prelude  This game is AWESOME and I'm wondering why is so cheap?
3381	1	a	This game is comically bad. Kind of fun for short bouts of mindless shooting but it will never be the Halo it so desperately desires to be.
3233	1	a	 Worth much more than 1 Euro/Dollar
1648	0	a	If I was given a chance to refund a single game, it would be this.   There is an interesting mechanic (diving into enemies, power-ups etc.) but its connection to the game is vague at best. Going into something feels nothing more than a ânext levelâ button , thus making it easier to lose track of your progress, everything looks so similar, if not identical.
3688	1	a	  Karate chopped a T-Rex to death, roleplayed as Daisy Buchanan by running over a crowd of raptors, and then played as a dinosaur suicide bomber. 10/10
1673	1	a	Indie game of the year for me. And, yes. I have played Bastion.
408	1	a	
6430	1	a	I LIKED THE VIOLENCE AND BLOOD WHEN YOU KILL DINOS
2084	1	a	OLD REVIEW IS OLD. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY â¥â¥â¥  First off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game 'Dino Beatdown'.   Now, let's go with the review: The game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs... Sure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good. Just imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!  The game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...  Then there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi. Oh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.  There's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.  I give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.
2019	1	a	I am not 100% sure I can recommend this game. I don't even know where I got it from.  If it's free or under $1, then maybe. If not, then no. It's like someone ported a flash game to Steam. It's pretty bad, but that's what also makes it funny.  Fly into the sun? No problem. Turn around and fly away.  The main bulk of the game seems to be a Super-Mario type of platformer with guns and a gravity arm. Or somethi- HNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG 
5780	1	a	I rarely understand what is happening in this game.  But â¥â¥â¥â¥ it: Dinosaurs.
2619	0	a	First match I get the flag and a T-Rex tries to eat me. I glitch through the bottom of the map and am stuck down there for the rest of the match along with the egg. Very buggy.
3545	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
1658	1	a	I truely can't understand how I'm so addicted to this...
5324	0	a	I paid 0.79 and i feel cheated.... After i bought this my parents are questioning my ability to make decisions. Just wait for steam sales maybe its will be worth it when its cheaper. 
1389	1	a	Great game, very fun!
5745	0	a	beshe 1$ se e free.......deiba
5345	0	a	I have a crappy computer but this is very very slow.
2201	1	a	If you are using Steam Enhanced and see that this game has many dislikes, dont act on that. This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.   Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.
5133	0	a	Was looking forward to this game, game crashed after I pressed button 'B' to buy weapons in a game. Man, I sure love this game.
1904	0	a	This game is as fun as my dead goldfish.
3019	1	a	I really liked this game so much but only two thing in this game need to fix, the sounds always out of sync and weapons need some improvments when shooting the big birds, but i recommended for sure when you play it with your friends its more fun!
5920	0	a	by far the worst halo simulator ive ever seen. i mean my god! it violated me. it lured me inside with the promise of eye candy, why, just why!  (only took a few minutes to realise it was just awful)
6463	1	a	Flew my car into a horde of dinosaurs....I died. 10000/10
604	1	a	I bought the franchise pack and debated starting with the 2nd game or the first. I decided to start with the 1st one. I love it, I found my self thinking about different strategies at work even :) I like to use different strategies all the time, so I never just stick to one. It is easy to beat this game using only 1 type of strategy but the fun lies in tinkering about.  Stability: 8/10 - can hang for extended periods of time during loading screens Art: 9/10 - Suits the atmosphere of the game and is consistent through out Sound: 8/10 - Fits the mood the game tries to portray. Fire crossbow sound get's messed up if you strafe shoot. Gameplay: 9.5/10 - fluid and responsive, a joy to play. One downside is that orc attacks will hit you even if you are out side their attack animation. Story: 4/10 - interesting potential but is very sparse and lacks any detail Replayability: 9/10 - I love going back to get higher combo's and 5 skulls  If, like me, you bought both games, start with the first 1, it's extremely fun and the story does carry over to the 2nd game
5989	1	a	a very fun dino game to play with friends :D
6190	1	a	its a nice game , but why is it so cheap :o i was expecting it to be 20$ or something its really good for a 0.99$ game
2533	1	a	 I dont know why people complain about this game, i think it is very enjoyable, fun to play with friends,and the bugs that people seem to complain about(example:cant connect servers/lobbys, vehicles like Vtols crash around, dinosaurs pop to outposts,walk trough walls and other that kind of lies. I havent met any of these so said 'real bugs' in the game. I can connect the game lobbys when i want, the game has crashed only 2 times for me, the dinosaurs are not phasing trough the walls, VTOLS and other vehicles work like they should. The complaining about the sounds aint true, atleast i dont have them, weapons sound just like they should( except the Revolver, but it might have intergrated silencer like WW2 STEN had). Buy this game for real, you can enjoy it, or hate it doesnt make my life different. 
1298	1	a	A good game, improves on the predecessor on all aspects except maybe the campaign is still short, also is less frustrating than the first one on hard difficulty! Rating: âââââ
4649	1	a	This game is Great but the thing is you need good graphics to run it my pc was running the game so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing slow but if you got the graphics then buy it
4113	1	a	Love this game &lt;3 i even thought it was awesome when it first was realesed
5093	1	a	I wasn't expecting much  I am very happy I bought this, and in fact purchased a copy for my buddy in Mexico! I ried Dino D Day and it left a bad taste in my mouth, so I checked this one out and I LOVE IT! Yes it's a bit low budget, but it's not a bad game by any means. It has elements of a good RPGFPS that has some obvious influence, and a lot of dinosaurs to shoot in the face. Getting in a tank and blowing a trex out of the sky is awesome, but the cool part was that the tank wasn't over powered in defense and was quickly blown to pieces by a triceratops, which I was sad and satisfied at the same time with.  Overall there are enough guns to make some choices for, the classes are cool, and has a great value to it as well. I had to tweak some settings due to slow mouse tracking, seemed kind of laggy/choppy in the way the aim moved but tweaking some things, it's now working fine. I've not tried the PVP out yet but overall found this to be worth the dollar, and then some.  I'd love to see the devs add more to this game, and for the community to keep it strong. Loads of rooms online, very active, very fun!
1915	0	a	Just Don't   2/10
1998	1	a	a realy fun but hard game
4866	1	a	0.72 euro , preaty cheap for a game like this play cs:go one day , get this game , shoot some dinos , have some fun for free !
1117	1	a	OMD1 and OMD2 are great games!   Generally i don't like 3rd person games but have for this series to be a ton of fun.  OMD2 is better of cause with more options, traps and maps.  Good replayablity as i keep coming back for weekly bashes and always keen to try differant trap combos.   Can't think of and negitives, but a first person view would be a nice touch. maybe something for OMD3 Ha!  Highly recomend! 
76	1	a	It's a solid game, very innovative combination of poker and fantasy TCG game style. Unfortunatelly, it lacks multiplayer game mode which would be fun to play. However, the single player storyline is interesting and the whole game atmosphere is very nice. I especially liked the in-game music, I must say I really enjoy listening to it.
4058	1	a	I got this game for a dollar. Definetly worth it.
1860	1	a	It's a platformer, and if you don't like platformers this probably wil lbe no exception. However, it is a startlingly good platformer with some fun mechanics. The gravity gun is fun, and the levels are somewhat challenging and have a solid amount of variety.
246	1	a	The name of the game is defend teleportation rifts from onslaughts of hundreds of orcs with hilarious lines. You can do this with several weapons, spells and strategically placed traps, all of which are unlocked one by one for completing each of 24 different levels. While the game probably won't keep you glued for hours at a time due to its repetitive nature, it's at least 8 hours in length or more if you hope to achieve 5 stars (or skulls in this case) on every map to get the most out of your trap upgrades. I for one love traps and defensive structures in games, so needless to say, it got all the more amusing watching my traps grow to an un-escapeable nature by the last few waves of growing orc numbers and other varying monster types. It's great casual fun with a nice challenge and I reccomend it to anyone, as long as you can get past the fact that the options menu is quite limited. Oh, and no re-bindable keys. For shame!
990	1	a	Highly entertaining at the cost of little time and effort.
5311	0	a	fun cool game. but my computer wont run it so i have to give it a thumbs down
950	1	a	Excellent tower defense game, I recommend!
5802	1	a	I remember buying this for like $3.00. Now it's not even a buck. I feel ripped off. 10/10
4452	1	a	Don't belive metacritic on this one, it deserves atleast a 7/10. If you like killing floor you will probably like this and is well worth picking up on sale.
5434	0	a	The developer is a scumbag
3927	1	a	This is the best game i have ever played on steam, it is perfect, there is nothing i would change about it. 10/10 i MADE all my close friends buy this game
3415	1	a	Good ol' dinosaur vs. human gameplay. It's similar to Dino D-Day or Primal Carnage.   You can play as a variety of dinosaurs in the Rampage gamemode, including a generic dromaeosaur, T. rex, Spinosaurus, and two pterosaurs. In any other mode, you'll play as one of three human classes; the Assault, Support, and the Recon.   It's fun to play with friends, but playing alone can be a challenge.
6401	1	a	Haven't played any other games that lets me repeatedly quickscope raptors
3312	1	a	this game would be horrendous if it didnt have coop
5259	1	a	i have played this game for half a hour a already had loads of fun i mean its mother******* lightsabres chopping up dinosaurs whilst mechs are shooting away at the giant trex who is trying to eat you i would highly recommend this to anyone 
1461	1	a	Shank... What a gaming jewel...  Great game, great gameplay, wonderful graphics and good enough story for this kind of game.   10/10
1827	1	a	Good game but can make you rage.
5589	0	a	Do you like to be; disappointed by a game?,thinking it was something like ARK?,then finding out it sucks balls?  THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU
5043	0	a	I want to like this game, so bad. but inbetween a terrible player base and constantly losing connection ive yet to play a full game from start to finish. the 7 hours i played is not alot relatively speaking, but â¥â¥â¥â¥, youd think youd at least play 1 game all the way through. Other players leave you to die, steal your vehicle leaving you stranded and take your equipment after you die. Not to mention the constant series of kicks ive gotton after simply going down once after i join 4 or 5 waves in.  If by chance these things dont frustrate you and you manage to hurdle past these issues, the connectivity is so wonky youll disconnect in the midst of a fire fight.  This game has a great premise and wonderful execution, iand i desperatley want to like it, but god damn is it hard. maybe my experience is unique to me alone but thats my review
3932	1	a	It is fun enough said
5740	0	a	i dont need to be rude but, i just didnt like the game, i prefer zombies then dinos.
2515	1	a	If you play games with a group this is a hands down awesome game for the price.  on another note I was able to trade this game for ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS   Dinos for Rockets   10/10 would trade again  It's like syrim with dinos and guns 10/10 ~ IGN
1873	1	a	Didnt know where i got it. got cards. gg no re â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5485	0	a	This game is more dead than my dad.
2818	1	a	Real fun often you can get this with a discount so be sure to check it out
1640	0	a	This game... it's just not really good. It's very pretty! It reminds me a lot of LBP, but the gameplay... is more like an iphone game.
3178	1	a	So this is how the dinosaurs became extinct... 10/10, would force species into extinction again.
2893	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. With guns. Also, Jetpacks. Win.
4665	0	a	How to remove game from my account?
1175	1	a	While I admit this game is quite fun, it's just not as enjoyable as it would be if it had multiplayer. Worth it? If you don't mind doing everything by your lonesome.
1825	1	a	Interesting game
5401	1	a	This is what Jarissic Park should have been about.
6202	0	a	played this with a few friends for about 50 minutes, and we all got a lot of frame drops, easy to learn and understand if you have played things like killing floor with a few good extras. but over all its just annoying getting damaged costantly especially by the flying dinos and you either can't hit them because your frames have dropped so much you have to stop playing for a second or that they are already too far away to hit. Didn't enjoy
3409	1	a	I saw the rating for the game was a 36/100, but that was a bit of a lie. This game is actually quite fun and challenging. I highly recommend this game if you liked Killing Floor or Sanctum. It's a bit of both games.
1226	1	a	My all time favorite tower defense type game. The price is too cheap for it's worth. Love the style and the humor in the game. The only flaw that I can find on this game, there's no Co-Op.
1547	1	a	Great Game. I need Warp 2 now!
5719	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
4911	0	a	i was tricked by all the good reviews into downloading orion,its nothing new and not worth ur time,terrible bad grahics,bad font,game screen looks dated and biggest downer was tht as i started playing i thought' what the heck?' im running faster than dinos and its almost like a arcade shooter or a shooting range hitting carboard like dionos,so u can hate me for putting it like this...but u dont want to do this - go play on ur mobile!
3305	1	a	One of THE BEST games I've ever played. You can fight each other, team up and survive or just plain muck around. Orion is DEFINETLY in my top favourites.
6298	1	a	This is how i started this game Meh... dino survival game AND then later......ha raptor easy,dilo easy,pteredon easy,THEN.....round 30,2 TREX SPINOSAUR TRIKE STEGO CROCODILE.then dies: :( 12/10 BEST MOUNTAIN DEW EVER 
3741	0	a	i had higher hopes for this, it was very disappointing -_-
5559	0	a	I've played this game, and it's alright, but nothing special. It's missing a lot of polish. I was hoping to play the newer one, but after learning that the company ripped off assets from other games and then LIED about it (seriously, just say your models were inspired by theirs. That's at least partially believable), I have no desire to support this company any longer, and I wouldn't recommend buying anything from them.
934	1	a	Mindless fun. Buy it on sale.
2159	1	a	The year was 1967. We'd just been deployed in the delta to keep the Cong and NVA from approaching some of the major trails. I was trudging through one of the tree covered marshes, soaked to the core, wondering what the hell I'd gotten myself into. We were two minutes away from setting up an M249 on a rigged turret when out of nowhere what looked like a pterodactyl flew down and exploded, killing four people in my unit. From there on out, it was hell, neon lights everywhere, and then the god damned t-rex had to come in and stomp our â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Either way, this is a 10/10 simulation of Vietnam War II's opening, with Far Cry Blood Dragon acting as a good reenactment of the end of VWII. May the t-rexes of the world rot where they stand.
1041	1	a	Beautiful indie game, if a indie company can make this and charge only 15 dollars, it proves the mass market gaming industry is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. This game plays smoother, looks better, and is more fun than most of the crap being released today. did i mention its only 15$ compared to what? 60$ for a average game? 9/10 (-1 point cause they say infinite replayability, but thats only cause of a leaderboard, if it had a survival mode it would be 10/10 definately)
237	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
6071	1	a	Wow, I bought the game while it was free to play then when I go to play it it says it expired or something like that. So I go to this and I bought it for a friend I wasted 2 dollars but my friend can play the game I dont get it!
4711	0	a	Oh wow, this is free now?  The optimization is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥, and motion blur is only noticable on dinos, not the camera.
346	1	a	there be goblins
5122	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
1157	1	a	What a great twist on the tower defense genre. This game will have you killin orcs for hours
2807	1	a	this game is like an arcade game from the mid 90's that you played once and forgot because you played MK2 for so long afterwords and wished you had that quarter back.
5663	0	a	Baby's first UDK game, but it's cheap and you don't have to think while playing. Keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed. (Edit: Also, the devs are thieving hacks.)
3422	1	a	The last few times I played this with friends I was eaten by a T-Rex 4 different times. A+ would play again.
5939	1	a	Well, I got to play this game for free on a weekend deal before the update... it was less than mediocre. But now after the patching and stuff i'd say it is fairly decent.     7/10
6243	1	a	more bugs than fallout. 11/10
6170	0	a	If you got the 99c to spend on something you might play two or three times, go ahead and purchase. I wasn't really into it personally. There are very few servers to play on and they're very laggy. The fact that you have to pay 99c for a game that could easily go on the free to play list (considering there's an in game shop) just seems like a bad business tactic. Maybe I just joined the wrong servers, maybe my internet was bugging out, maybe it's just not my type of game but I wouldn't recommend this one when there's sales on much better games out there.
1472	1	a	Glorified violence at its best
6423	1	a	Honestly, when this game came out I thought the critics rated it a little harshly but I can't say they where wrong. Now after I have played it myself a few years later, I can say it is a good game. It's not a masterpiece in any sense of the word, but it is some mindless fun with your friends for a few hours every now and then. I've even had quite fun with playing by my lonesome with the bots.
4782	0	a	no server for sea, play at 200 ping
684	1	a	a damn good game that anyone who likes tower defense and/or FPS games should get, definetly in my all time top 10 games absolutly excellent, alot to do and a huge variety of traps and weapons to keep you amused for hours. only shortcoming is its only single players but then theres OMD2 so go get that aswell!!!!!
4007	0	a	Worth the dollar to laugh at how utterly terrible it was, but only barely.
3170	1	a	This game is tons of fun! Got it on sale , but having so much fun playing co-op / survival with my wife that it would be worth full price. Pretty easy game to learn with enought variety to make it fun , but not so much to make it overly complicated. Love the fact that I can set up a friends only game with bots. Makes it fun with just 2 of us playing. ( Or single player ). Bots actually work pretty good !! Will heal you as well as get in vehicles with you. Graphics are very good and gameplay runs prettty smooth. Really nice game to just jump in and blow the crap out of some dinosaurs! Good variety of vehilces , weapons , maps , and augmentations. I was'nt expecting much for a game that was so inexpesive , but was extremly surprised &amp; happy on how good this game turned out to be! One of the best values for the money I've gotten. Would definately reccomend this game !!
5448	0	a	I killed a few mindless dinos while some Australian man yelled at me. Also, the gunshot sounds didn't sync with the animation. Would not play again.
1626	1	a	Casual version of Super Meat Boy.  A short game (3~4 hours for 100% completion) with precision platforming in a casual style. The player character does not jump, instead it floats like a jetpack.
5668	0	a	ORION: Prelude  This game is fun enough, fairly basic but fun to spend some time shooting up dinos and whatnot. But the reason I don't recommend this game is due to the company actions and the CEO David Prassel.  The Trek Industries and the CEO David Prassel have lied and mislead customers multiple times, two instances being them trying to 'rename' the game in order to get a new MetaCritic score and get people to essentially pay twice for the same game, and the most recent being Trek Industries initiating a slander campaign against Activision. Previously, David Pressal has also treated employees with disrespect, firing them once they completed their work and before they were paid.  DO NOT SUPPORT THIS KIND OF DEVELOPER
2352	1	a	It cost me less than two dollars. And I can shoot dinosaurs.
4029	1	a	i actually bought a skin for my character in this game with my hard earned cash. immediately regretted it  10/10
5098	1	a	really fun free game. i enjoy just slaughtering all those helpless dinosaurs. enjoyed this game over full priced games.
774	1	a	Wicked fun, and honestly AMAZING value for the money. Even if you don't like tower-defense style games, I would recommend giving this a try!
5789	1	a	Honestly, this game is really good. The gameplay isn't too bad, albeit a bit buggy. However, one thing to keep in mind. Yes, this game is buggy, but so was Dead Island. The difference is, Dead Island is $20.00, and this is $0.99. It has decent multiplayer, and replayability. So, I have to say, for being under a dollar, this game is incredible.
2781	1	a	Although more work on the game needs to be done, the game itself is really quite fun. that of course if you play with or in a group of people or friends. playing alone is a more hard and really just pointless, you wont survive long and it way less fun.  for my opinion there is no point of buying the game without friends to play with. its just don't worth it, but if if you do have someone to play with and you love the idea then give it a shot
5563	1	a	If your reading this review it means you want to buy the game, if you want to buy this game it is because It is dirt cheap. If you are buying this game because it is cheap it means you are broke, if you are broke you have a garbage potato computer, if you have a garbage potato computer you can't run this game. 10/10 best game ever would buy if I was not broke.
3469	0	a	What do you get when you cross rampaging dinosaurs with jetpacks,explosions,sci-fi action and co-op gameplay? An awesome videogame idea.What do you get when you play ORION: Dino Horde? A terrible,terrible experience. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played.Not only is it badly made,poorly executed,ridiculously framed, and badly coded.It's just unplayable game  Donât bother.Save your money.If you want an engaging sci-fi cooperative experience,buy Natural Selection 2 instead !!! :)
5866	1	a	It's $1 and a very well done, fun game.
4456	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
2417	1	a	THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN AIDS! I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS AMAZING AND I LIKE DINOSAURS. ONCE A BIG BIRD THING GRABBED ME AND IT CHUCKED ME OFF A ROCK AND I GOT SCARED. BUT IT WAS FUN AND I LIKED IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITED GAMES OF 2015. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
5392	1	a	Hainanese Chicken Rice Never Tasted This Good Before?! Good Price, Kappa Gamers.
3185	1	a	A bit buggy game, but enjoyable none-the-less. Shooting down a Pteranadon? Heck yes!
1770	0	a	The biggest problem with this game is that it's  unpolished .    The main feature, the physics beam, is awkward to control, and it lets go at the most inconvinient times.     The art is inconsistent and underwhelming. I'm not sure, but I think I could have done most of the art assets in MS Paint. And the semi-realistic gold nugget looking things are supposed to be antimatter? Please, just do a Google search and find a better asset. The same few enemies and bits of terrain are also resued over and over, which results in a boring, static experience.     There is very little challenge and no penalty for failure. If you die, the only thing you lose is time off your life as you respawn at the latest checkpoint with no golden antimatter nuggets missing and the enemies respawned.This obviously makes it very easily to cheese some antigold nuggets by suicide-jumping them.     The reload feature is instant - just press 'R' - and you never stop shooting. It may as well not be there at all for how much it impacts gameplay.    There are some good bits, of course, but not enough to justify the full $5 price. Honestly, I've seen better games written in Flash for my browser.
2072	1	a	i mean... i dunno it's alright, it's kind of god awful in a hilarious broken buggy kind of way. But it's a dollar for a few hours of super cheap fun. You have to pay more for a can of coke than this game, and though coke is tasty and refreshing, this game costs less money and therefore is better than coke.
1423	1	a	This game ROCKS as the first part.
725	1	a	The ultimate Tower Defense 3rd person shooter; I would have payed $60 for this game!
666	1	a	Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time. Whatever your approach, an orc's pain is your gain. You must download, because Orcs Must Die.
4657	1	a	This game is very fun, although I doubt it before I played it. Absolutely worth buying. This is actualy great. I rate it 9/10, but it has sound problems and takes too much PC performance.
609	1	a	this is a great tower defense game. good music, maps are quite challenging, many weapon (I missed the gunbow when moved to Orcs must die 2), traps ....and interesting winning pose.
3573	1	a	Such a fun thing to play with friends, definately reccomend giving it a try. I got addicted.
4861	1	a	Drove my friend off a cliff while driving and survived. He's dead.  Watched someone use their final breaths to crawl towards the broken generator and I cheered him on. He's dead.  Chased some poor guy as a spinosaurus, caught him, and grabbed him with my mouth. He's dead.  Played Vital (PvPvE) against some guy and he was mauled by dinosaurs. He's dead.  I'm all alone.
2965	1	a	Don't listen to the haters. Its 79p for god's sake. You get what your paying for and for the money, with some mates, it's really not that bad.
484	1	a	A fun game with a variety of interesting ways to make those orcs die.
1950	0	a	This game can get boring easily. The level select is very confusing, and even if you liked it it would take a while to get use to. I don't recommend this game, not because I don't like it, but because of the game mechanics, how it works, etc. Its kinda fun at the first level or two I guess, but the game is pretty repetitive.
176	1	a	Great game with nice humour
984	1	a	Is there better way to spend night than slice hordes of orcs? Probably yes, but it wouldnât be so fun. This is one of games which gave me most fun of all games I played. It has proper mixture of action, fun, creativity and humour. It is not too hard to finish, but same time enough challenging. It has great replayability because offers almost endless possibilities to combine traps and spells to get better score. Game is cheap even at full price, and if you get it on sale as I was it is bargain.
3281	0	a	boring
3748	1	a	10/10 I love this game with a burning pashion, if you have 1$ i reccomend this game.
5009	1	a	Great game with dinosaur fighting and good stratergy :D
2574	1	a	playing alone by yourself this game will be boring and you will regret buying it playing with friends however provides a really fun experience. this game is actually quite fun the leveling perk system is unique and gives you a nice rpg feel to it and wide variety and weapon types is also good ive been playing this for awhile and i find it fun reminds me of borderlands and halo almost with a good horde slapped on i play this with my buddies alot and we have a blast this is really fun if you have friends that are interested go for it you guys will have fun so far im enjoying it.
2804	1	a	You can kill a T-rex with a lightsabre.  10/10
5014	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
6187	1	a	Fun and alot of bang for the buck, not saying that it is good compared to the price, but good in general!
2395	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ !
5179	0	a	this is literally the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ive ever played in my entire life. Its just plagued with so many issues and the developers must have had their heads up their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥ to implement some of the gayest things ive ever seen in this game. All in all i give this game a -20/10 and sentance the developers to go suck a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and learn how to make an enjoyable game
6464	1	a	One of the best games on steam to play when you want to relax and kick back.
2701	1	a	Was expecting to eat many people (cough cough Chris Pratt). Got bored and started killing friendly dinos (for sport... of course) and maybe ate some velociraptors and stomped on some compys in the process.   roar/10 would kill everything that moves again.    p.s. : I did better in the movie, except for the whole dying part.
1178	1	a	An absolute gem! Tower defence mixed with 3rd person shooter and rpg elements. The game is also hilarious, seemless, and the mechanics are fluid and easy to grasp, yet hard to master. There is more than one way to pass each level.   A friend bought me this game as a joke when it was on sale, and it ended up taking over our lives for a few months! Think about how much fun your $10 will buy you at a movie theater or a coffee shop... I guarantee this game will give you way more fun for less money.
952	1	a	Tremendous fun and way way better than most of the offerings of the oversaturated hero/tower defense genre. Lovely physics gimmicks.
6480	1	a	This game is probably the best bang for the â¥â¥â¥â¥ game in all of steam. You are gave the ability to trickshot dinosaurs while knowing the fact you spent under Â£1 for it. Definitely one for the grannys out there with aids.
1507	0	a	I wish there was a way to NOT RECOMMEND games. REQUIRES ORIGIN! :(   Edit 11/26/2013 - Steam finally gave a way to not recommend games. Thank you!
2032	1	a	Such Cheap Much Card Very 10/10 Wow
976	1	a	It is rare that a game remembers what games are all about and remembers it the entire way through the game. Orcs Must Die! keeps its eye on the prize: fun. Every aspect of the game is designed around fun. Orcs exploding: fun. Death traps: fun. The player figuring their own ways through levels, not being restricted to a certain type of approach: fun. There's little in the way of plot, but just enough to keep it...fun. Until this game, I never felt the need to get every achievement just to eek out more playtime, but this game was good enough that I did so. It can be quite frustrating, but that mostly happens through challenges you make yourself - you don't have to 5 star every level, you don't have to play through nightmare mode, but you'll want to. It's a fantastic game that is just long enough, with just enough plot, to make every single section fun.
2299	1	a	I was hesitant to get this, because of its metascore, but it's actually worth it. This game is a great FPS that reminds me of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (anyone else?), but I can guarantee you that this game is original and only reminds me of it. In this game, you kill dinosaurs with guns, something I've always wanted to do as a child.  In spite of a few bugs here and there, this game is pretty good (very good if you got it for its sale price). With just a bit more development, this game has the potential to get its metascore where it schould be.  I rate ORION: Dino Horde a 7.75 out of 10.
1283	1	a	Excellent co-op experience. Ranks up there with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.
3847	1	a	'But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents!' Not only that this game only cost me 99 cents, It's better then some games that I bought at full price.  What I like about this game: -The devs are active in the games development -It's a fresh idea (You don't see alot of Dino killing games, amirite?) -Great Value, and all DLC and Updates are Free! (Who doesn't like free?) -There is a cash shop in where you can buy most items for a doller -The cash shop only sells cosmedics -Tons of Replayability -Mechs, APC tanks, and VTOLs -There's a Lightsaber  What I don't like: -If you join a game late, you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed -If you have bad internet, you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed -Sadly, not alot of people play this game :c  ââââââââââ
627	1	a	Lot's of fun. I enjoy it a lot.
4467	1	a	The Best Halo Games on pc lol just kidding  Orion prelude its a good game for just 1$  if you have a spare money on your wallet you should check this game out
3248	1	a	if u have a computer that cant run games very well do not buy lololoolololl laggy af
1171	1	a	really addicting tower defense game and can really get u thinking
2419	1	a	in this game, I used a jetpack to fly up to a t-rex's head, and hit it in the face with a lightsaber. and its usually 99 cents! Does anything else need to be said?
534	1	a	very fun and very addicting if you love tower defense games and first person advencture/action games this is the game for you as it takes both those genres and blends it into awesome
3950	1	a	Dinosaurs. Jetpacks. Rocket launchers. Currently 0,75â¬. Totally worth it.
3464	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
893	1	a	This game is a super fun hack-and-slash and easily runs! There's not even a storyline to get in the way.
2488	1	a	10x better then 'Call of Duty' :P
5412	0	a	Like Skyrim with Bad Dinosaurs
1629	1	a	Take Storm on a wonderful adventure in his magical teacup. Storm's brother Cloud has created an amazing dream-like world for you to explore! Solve puzzles, avoid pitfalls and beat the bad guys in this imaginative and unique platformer!
3761	1	a	its cool but it makes your computer hot
5166	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a game. The game is alright and the content is pretty solid for what it is, decent weapons and class choices to be made, vehicles and game modes to keep the title fresh. With variations to difficulties and XP to farm for class progression this game has good reason for returns.  Edit: Game is called Prelude becasue dodgy COO types.  Has achievements and badge progress. I like this game, and like what it has to offer, the people behind it though....
391	0	a	Happy plus ONE.Less in an hour,think I'm not that naive.
5145	0	a	Fun for a laugh but considerably less polished than co-op shooters like Payday and L4D.
2408	0	a	Better than the meta-score, but still not worth playing.
5842	1	a	The game is fun and it pays itself with trading cards. 10/10 would sell cards again.
89	0	a	Neat Concept, but in the end too short and too easy
1008	1	a	Epic first person tower defense fiery crossbow sword wielding flame roasting orc slaying madness. Good Times.
1765	1	a	BEEP!...*Force Close*
5025	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
1276	0	a	For me, this Shoot'em Up lacks of that 'chaotic' feeling of the genre. Is a little slow for my taste and poor on the variation of the situations so is very probably to fall on monotony. Have some customization for your ship and challenges to take on but nothing special to recomend it.  Requires EA activation.
5033	1	a	The best firest P shooter ever made and whith DINOS
649	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is one of those really great indie-titles that deserves more attention than it has got. Sure the second game is way better, but nonetheless the first game rocks too! A first-person tower defence, Orcs Must Die! finds the perfect balance between tactical setups and mindless killing action. The game becomes quite challenging later - which can be good for some I bet. I, for one, can have a hard time controlling the battlefield, when enemies swarm from every side.  The designs of traps, levels and enemies are classic, but great, and the game offers hours of fun. The variety of traps are remarkable, and fighting alongside your tactical setup is a great way of playing this kind of game. Though the game lacks co-op, which thankfully has been addressed in the sequel.  DIE!!! .... After you have bought the game.
3064	1	a	It's good.       ....For .99 cents.
3432	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
800	1	a	LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN... always love td games, this is a great lighthearted one with lots of very funny one liners like.. well wait and see and you will be 'Winning!'  Seriously worth a tenner considering that would last u 20 mins in a pub. Had over 20 hrs play time on it and not nrly finished everything yet.. then i suck anyway lol!
3577	1	a	1. Open map not open world 2. lots of cool weapons and upgrades 3. Great online play 4. Not alot of fun single player 5. Graphics pretty good.  This game is alot of fun online if your able to work as team. I find it most fun playing with just friends or family because team work is key its not like COD. This is NOT open world however. It is a small to medium sized map.  Guns+DInos= buy it

3476	0	a	A shoddily made wave defense game.
2380	1	a	There's dinosaurs?! That was scary as all hell!
6022	1	a	The game is actually really fun despite its lackluster graphics and off physics. Theres a decent enough array of dinosaurs and the game does get challenging, the vehicles are fun to drive, theres a good assortment of them and overall its a fun experience. Its definetley worth the $15 price tag, and i was lucky nough to have gotten it for only $1.50.
1303	1	a	Shank 2 is a great game, so much fun! remind me old time arcades! and you know, it has STEAM TRADING CARDS !! yeap.. even in the store page dont say it , it has !
3213	1	a	Air lifted a Deinosuchus with a spaceship. 5/5
1308	1	a	Shank 2 is a great sequel and in my opinion, better than the first game in basically every way.   The visuals are definitely an improvement over the first game, and one of the very first things I noticed was the larger variety in locations you visited. The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition.   Another improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.  Everything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.  Overall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.
6388	1	a	This game is fun!!!
1889	1	a	Pretty fun. Not really worth 2 dollars, but on sale for 50 cent is pretty reasonable.

3844	0	a	To be honest this is the second worst game I have ever played! It's even worse then civ 5 which is a waste of money. Never buy this game even if it is free.
4096	1	a	it's like blood n bacon but with dinosaurs!
1030	1	a	An excellent single player indie game.  Has 3 game modes - warmage, nightmare and high scoring. Played within that order. Once you have completed the game on nightmare you can aim for the highscore tables, but high scores are achieved by getting combo kills, so require entirely different tactics.   The traps are interesting, there are a handful that you will never use and others you will use in some levels. The swinging mace is one of the most deadly traps you can use.  2 DLCs - Lost adventures adds 5 maps, 1 is a map already in the game played in reverse (a very unique map and a very entertaining map, playing in reverse does make it harder). They also added a handful of new monsters, like the frost bat. Well worth getting.   - the second DLC is not as worth while, contains a few new traps and weapons. Accessable from the start of the game as well, which makes the first few levels extremely easy if used.   However, both DLCs are worthing picking up when on offer.
3002	1	a	Forget about what all the critics say. This game is suprisingly good fun! It may be buggy and a tad rough around the edges but its very playable and you will have alot of fun with it for sure! So I reconmend you give this game ago!
5433	0	a	I promoted this developer and their games for quite a while, including buying several copies for friends. In light of their years of employee abuse and stolen assets, coupled with their playing the victim card each time, I can no longer recommend this company or their games. Considering how much information is available, and not knowing what sources you personally trust, I recommend googling 'ORION stolen assets' or 'ORION employee abuse' and deciding for yourself which side you believe.
5380	1	a	Better put some prelude on that, you dinoâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3815	1	a	It's like a horrifying but wonderess car accident, it looks dreadful but you can't stop looking at it.  Set you expectations to 0 and you'll enjoy playing a fairly bugy and at times sorta nice looking dinosaur shooter(but mostly kinda ugly) with run of the mill shooting mechanics and an inconsistent art style that looks like multiple artists got into a fight over how the game will look and just decided to put multiple styles into it because they couldn't be bothered to decide.  So, if you have 0.79 $ laying around somewhere, need to kill a few hours of your time and have no idea what else to play or do, then pick up Orion: Prelude because it's actully a bit of fun for a while and as i said, it's dirt cheap, actully it is the cheapest game you can buy right now on steam.  Bottom line : It's cheap,it's cheesy,it's glitchy but still can be fairly fun at times specially with a nice group of people.
2956	1	a	ok its food for the first 4 hours then you start to realize that it is way too damn easy. that makes it bad. the controls for the vehicles are annoying, i mean who does the borderlands controls like they suck... i want to press 'a' or 'd' to turn not move my mouse... the game really does suck â¥â¥â¥ though. though it is fun if you like that kind of game.  now i will say it is fun, i will say it is intresting, i will say it is worth the buck you pay for it, and i will say that if you have enough cards to sell, sell them and get this game. its bad but not for the price and the enjoyment you can get out of it.   will i play it again? yeah at some point is it worth my money? yeah it is... it's only a buck. is it worth playing? depends how bad are you at Modern Warfare...   this game is fun it is easy but hard at the same time, while i can survive multiple rounds (like 15) in Modern Warfare's servival mode, i only survive at most 5 in this game. but the shear size of the waves is rediculous. they get hard fast... but well sitting ontop of a rock and snipting the heck out of a few hundred dino's with a 75% acuracy rate... is rediculous. heck i think i am about 80 or 90 witht the top tier sniper... that isn't that hard to get. i can bearly hit the broad side of a barn in modern warfare when i snipe, yet along headshots are rare. in this game... you can pick up the sniper and head shot alot of dinos verry easilly. there are times you will run out of ammo before you miss a shot. large targets i guess...  lets now talk vehicles... they suck. getting them sucks even worse and well when you have to use an emp to access them... that is bad. intresting but bad.  i'm getting a little ranty so let me say the bottom line.  SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?  Yeah. you should. play if for 4 hours then realize it isn't much of a challenge. yes it is fun, and i would recomend this if you have a buck to spare.
573	1	a	Great fun for a few bucks, Probably shortlived but who cares for 10 euro? 1001 ways to kill a orc, you can probably find more :D
1319	1	a	Great fun, good game if you just wanna slice â¥â¥â¥â¥ up.
3085	1	a	This is so bad it's good trust me buy it it's amazing
3018	1	a	Okay, so you're probably thinking that this looks like some game for 5 year olds that the devs incorporated guns into. Well, I thought the same exact thing. WELL I WAS WRONG. This game is so much more than that and with the size of the actual game, with the sale going on, I would buy this game for a dollar in a heartbeat. Don't pass up this steal before it's to late. I have not bought it yet but I will make sure I do before the sale ends.
1222	1	a	This game is vomiting painful but enjoyable
3442	1	a	Since its $1 im going to ask myself this: Was this more enjoyable then something on the dollar menu at a fast food joint? Short answer Yes Long answer HELL YESSSSS brings me back to when i played turok as a kid 8/10
3511	0	a	Well it turns out that my review of 'Don't buy this it's junk.' wasn't helpful. So here's a more in depth one.  ----  Don't buy this! Even at 0.79p it's to expensive! The net code is rubbish. The leveling system bad. The AI terrible. The guns, well, not to bad actually. It just feels unfinished and slow even on my over the top PC.  If you want to spend time on a computer game you can find much better ones out there.
229	1	a	+) I liked how the game was. Your view, aim, the battle, sound and effects, etc.  +) Various types of enemies were interesting.  +) The fact that basic traps don't become obsolete was good.   -) It would've been more nice if we could fight the witch or was it mage?.  -) They make you click a lot. They should've made it auto so you can just press on. Not everyone is using game pads.  -) Having passive skills or upgrade for personal improvement would've been amazing but there was no such thing. There is a similar one but that's a choice and you have to spend defense money so NO to that.
4856	1	a	My thoughts: At first this game was unplayable because all of the lag but I fixed it after playing the game I just have to say that it's 'ok' not the best game ever but it's ok this game is worth 99 cents.  About the game: This game is a shooter you go wave to wave shooting and pistol whipping the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of Dinosaurs theres a bunch of modes. King of the Hill, TDM, Free for all and survival ETC.  Pros and Cons: Pros.  You get to pistol whip Dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs!  Mother ******* Dinosaurs!!!!  It has Coop  Cons.  A lot of lag on some platforms: how to fix it   http://steamcommunity.com//app/104900/discussions/0/864976115810928810/   It would of been better if it had a story.  Anyways I hope this helped you have a nice day :)
2016	1	a	Nice 2D game ever :D :D :D featured puzzle and adventure  the main goal of this game is waiting drop trading card :)
4499	1	a	ITS FUN at bit laggy but fun all the way! 
1372	1	a	One of the greatest 2D games to be used with a controller
1452	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
55	0	a	This is one of those games where you play it for a bit and then you get stuck. On the plus side, the main menu music is awesome.
4959	1	a	Rammed my friends tractor with a tank. Plenty of laughs for 1â¬.
1518	0	a	Warp is a console app store game brought to PC without considering the PC client base at all. Not only that but like all games sutured onto to the glutounes corporations you need to sign up for an account under another game client to play it.   Gameplay wise the puzzles are extremly simple and clearly made by uncreative people. You are never challanged and the upgrades you receive are never impressive. They try to tack on some narrative like all modern puzzle games, but that falls flat on its face in how trite it is. You won't want to purchase a soundtrack for this music score either, it's completly lackluster by all account.   *SIGH* you actually feel like you're getting dumber while playing it.
4783	0	a	I cant really play this game right now, until i get an better connection and see why this game is loved much, im not recommending it, personally i found it an bit confusing.
5057	1	a	THis game is so awsome! You can even be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaure!
2564	1	a	just had a LAN party. This game was one of the funnest games we played!
813	1	a	This game is, simply put, fantastic. It is basically a Third Person Action/Tower Defense game hybrid. I loved it. It is very humorous, but the story is not where it shines. In fact, the story is somewhat forgettable. The gameplay is what makes this game so great. It is challenging, unique, and most importantly, VERY fun. It also has a pretty decent replay value. However, I would recommend just getting Orcs Must Die! 2 instead, since it has moar weapons, traps, maps. OMD2 also has co-op which is great.. But if you want the classic maps from this game to play in Co-Op in OMD2, then you want to buy this one too. Treat it like a DLC to OMD2 that adds 10 maps.   9/10 (Buy OMD2 instead, or buy it on sale)
2369	0	a	Grafica e naspa.... Graphic is to low and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥....
6172	1	a	was 99cents very fun, very addicting, everyone should snatch this game up
1311	1	a	Surprisingly an extremely fun game once you get past some of the control problems. Makes me want to buy the first one...
2043	1	a	Must be an app of this :D !!!
1620	1	a	This is a strange little title. It's basically combatless platforming, where the goal is to collect items and reach the goal. In spite of that, it's very relaxing and has some surprising moments. The game is almost like a dream world, where players have to jump and glide in their little tea cup to get through the almost paper cut out worlds. It possesses an almost childlike sense of wonder and glee that many games lack these days.  This game is just plain fun, if you can get past the laid back tone and the unique visual style. It's not addictive, but it is relaxing and does possess a surprising amount of challenging. Nevertheless, I never got stressed out playing this game. In fact, it's actually a great stress reliever. There are some challenge modes in the game for added replay value, but considering the price, the story mode alone would be more than enough.
1286	1	a	Reminds me of polished Amiga titles like Chaos Engine and Disposable Heroes. Noisy 3D shoot-em-up that gets quite difficult but challenges in a good way, best played with twin analog stick controller.
3613	0	a	I played an entire game of this, A WHOLE 50 MINUTES. Word's cannot describe how bland and dull this game is if it was a sandwich it would be 1 slice of white bread, no butter, folded over a sliver of corned beef thats been opened and left in the fridge so it goes all dry and hard. Not enjoyable at all.
5079	1	a	It's cheap, runs smoothly, has servers running, some always populated, can play alone with bots to learn the game, LOTS of game modes, looks pretty awesome, sounds are good to okay, BIG maps, everything is customizable, has full X360 for Windows pad support, you can remap all controls on mouse+KB, or controller, did I meantion it's cheap??? A very under-rated game IMO, if more people played it, it could become popular, these guys did a good job with this game, My only gripe is 'some of the dinos are SO tiny/hard to shoot, but mele works okay on them (maybe they're baby dinos)'... everything else about this game save a few sound effects is awesome!
4579	1	a	punched t-rex in leg  got eaten  11/10
4134	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
1310	1	a	Bloody good time, side scroller with tons of blood, action and just fun to play. Using a controller makes for a more enjoyable game.
2497	0	a	The excitement of this game is about on par with Minesweeper.
1536	1	a	7.2 / 10
5751	1	a	Ever have that urge to punch a raptor in the face while you wear a high tech suit? I thought that would be stupid. Then I got a knife and broke the game. Dont try to make this game deep, it doesnt work. Just fly around with a minigun wrecking anything you touch.
913	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a beautiful game. That's not just the graphics, though the art is highly stylized and very fitting of the game's comical atmosphere. OMD takes the addictive mechanics of the tower defense genre and the fast-paced gameplay of an action RPG and creates a hybrid that works far better then would be expected. At first it just gives you a new tower every level, but then you get magic gauntlets and paladins and skill tree and meta-upgrades; there's a tremendous amount of content in OMD, and a tremendous number of orcs waiting to break through your defenses and charge your portals. If only you had aimed that fireball a little more accurately or placed those tar traps a bit further apart...  Oh well, 'Retry Level.'
797	1	a	This game is great. You should play it.
3130	1	a	Learned how to fly with a jetpack.. 11/10.
3496	1	a	If you ever thought 'Man, I lreally ike Halo, but what it was really missing was some dinosaur action' and then they took away all the Covenant and Flood, all the story, and added nothing but dinosaurs that seem to want to eat power stations, and your job is to commit genocide on the dinosaurs....  Then this is the game for you! p.s. If you paid more than 99 cents for this game, then you paid too much
6245	1	a	99c/99c would buy again
3943	1	a	It is now allmost free,soon,soo im giveing this a like
487	1	a	pretty fun little game, wish it was multiplayer
3005	1	a	Those that bought is game when it was 15 bucks must have felt cheated......I bought is at the price of dirt. Anyway Orion Dino Horde or what its now know as Orion Prelude is a game where you survive hordes of dinos attacking you,its similiar to many zombie games and wave of enemies games so you will enjoy tis if you enjoy those.
2979	1	a	its neat.
2529	1	a	This game is fun!It has ok graphics not the best but who care's.  Ok let me get to the point,I i was not to sure if i should buy the game but with all the helpful comments I bought it! It won't lag,trust me unless you are on a server with high ping.So I say buy the game you won't be sad if you do and please as soon as you go in-game don't say it sucks and you have wasted your money because you havent!Enjoy the game i know i have and just because i have only played 1.6 hours of it is because i just bought it so trust me for a game this cheap there is nothing to lose!You can make your own servers to play with your friends so have fun.
4170	0	a	Basic wave survival and was not worth the money (even your spare change). Try it if you want to get some trading cards or to pad out your Steam library.
3434	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot. Truly the best experience one could hope to have killing dino's with advanced technology.   And at the low low price of 1$ (during the steam sale) you would be an absolute fool to not buy this game on the spot and giggle in glee as you and your friends shoot and destroy dinos with various vehicles and weapons.   Game of the year 2013/2014/2015.  Buy it now.  9001/9001  2 1337 4 M3
3237	1	a	Never Ever Play Versus on this - no autobalance means that if you choose to be Dino there will be 10 marines aganst you - Just totally unfair  Cooperative Play works somehow will be hard to coordinate while in the dinos are attacking - ofcourse after the wave ends it will be slightly easier.  I would buy this while this is now on sale when this was written - until major fixes are made this is only Co-op Survival Game and not worth to pay full price  But always better than Space Empires V. Never buy that game... or even look at it.
5907	1	a	Not bad for its price, a good spread of weaponary and boosts. I decent escape from the average FPS.
201	1	a	Looks childish, but it is amazingly fun! Hours of gameplay and quite addicting! And it's not like one of those games where once you have good stuff everything is easy, the levels get super challenging. The downloadable content (DLC) is incredible, it makes the game 10 times better. I definately suggest buying this game AND the DLCs. Awesome game, and I highly recommend it!
3115	1	a	Run into dinosaurs Kill dinosaurs Get credits Spend credits Kill more dinosaurs ... Get a fancy hat  Superb game, loving every round and match.  Only downside is that from all the different game modes they offer, I only ever see Survival and Conquest servers. Which is basically the same thing...
528	1	a	Before I had my own steam account, I played this game all the time on my brother's account. I loved playing this game, endless upon endless hordes of orcs slaughtered at the hands of an 8 year old.
6308	1	a	This is better than some $60 games I've played.  And it's only 99 cents.
3318	1	a	Very cool gameplay, rampage/dino vs humans is my personal favourite
3952	1	a	Great concept, lots of options, nice co-op, it's a keeper!
5998	1	a	This is really a pretty terrible game. But, if you grab the right friends and you can get it dirt cheap, it can be a ton of fun.
1686	1	a	5.1/10 - Platformer: Disney's Wall-E with a Grav Gun!  I was fonder of playing this platformer than I thought; maybe it's that I have played so many bad ones... but this one delivered for the most part. The typical platformer template is combined with beautiful graphics and some unique gameplay. You mostly rely on your propulsion rockets and a gravity gun that can help you achieve your objectives.   Platformers can be difficult in general; and this one will cause you to struggle, but this game is more on the enjoyable and achievable side of things. There is quite a bit of content and plethora of maps to explore for the meager price of $2; caution though this game can be found on sale more often than not!  Worth the $2; I'd only pay $0.50 though since it's always on sale for that!     Accidently Reviewed
5247	0	a	paid 15 bucks for this and now its only a dollar. and the servers are quite laggy
100	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
1627	1	a	No.. Just no
3204	1	a	Dinosaurs + Guns...what can go wrong?
2198	1	a	I've never posted a serious review below a minimum playtime of 40 hours, but consider the following:  the average wage in western europe is above â¬6/h this game costs about 20% less than an espresso  If I ever want to get my money back, I'll have to work 8 minutes overtime, or walk past the coffee place next morning. I could never down-rate a game that cheap.  Besides, just the mere existence of vehicles and sandbox maps give Orion a very good replay value. Sometimes it feels like back in 2007 on Halo 2.  
1838	1	a	Take the f****** checkpoint, because 'The 'Lie' its a 'cake''.    After this game -&gt;&gt; Einsten genius -&gt;&gt; P. Nobel of Peace -&gt;&gt; Die  11/10
1478	1	a	this game reminds me of my childhood , best game ever played !
2740	1	a	So...the enemy AI is crap, the music is repetitive, and the guns/shooting is uninspired. Why am I recommending this? Well, it often goes on sale for under a dollar and the sheer enjoyment of co-op dinosaur shooting makes up for it. Expect about 4 hours of entertainment from this before your ears start to bleed from the sounds, but hey, 4 hours with friends shooting T-Rex are ones well spent.
1517	0	a	This piece of crap goes with a hard lock of mouse filter (meaning coursor movement is forcefully smoothed and sharp aiming is impossible). Be aware!
2862	1	a	Besides it being terribly hilarious, Dino Horde is really all I thought it was going to be. For only being able to play durring the free weekend, I was able to get a taste of something fun. Something that makes me laugh at it's simplicity, yet how amazingly fun it is. Best played with friends, this game is able to showcase just about everything it shows in the videos. It's a defense, survival, pvp/pve that does hearken to Halo, Killing Floor, and Jurassic Park as well. Though it goes beyond that into amazing maps, survival games, and even gives the players chances to get back at their friends in a multiplayer deathmatch.  It is a ton of fun, though I would say wait for a sale to get this. It's not exactly worth fifteen dollars in my mind, since there were bugs, but what game is without flaws? If you got it when it was a dollar, then hopefully you got your money's worth. This is most definitely worth the time for friends who want to have some co-op madness with dinosaurs and guns and mechs and always wanting to punch dinos in the face. That's always fun. :3
3548	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
4667	1	a	One match was really all I needed. It's my type of game but not polished enough for me. The graphics and sound aren't very good and the music is nothing spectacular either. Not to mention that the animations are really clunky and stiff. The gameplay is okay; it has a Turak and Halo combo. I must warn you though...I got bored right after my first match. There's no story or anything to this game. You just simply jump in and fight dinosaurs. There's 3 classes to choose from and they all have their own abilities. Assault has a jetpack, medic of course has a medic gun, and a stealth class that can go invisible for a short time. I also noticed I had a lot of connection problems which shouldn't happen since I have a gaming laptop. But some games will do this. I recommend it for a dollar only. 6/10
381	0	a	Felt like this was more of a game to be played on my Smartphone then PC.  
5977	1	a	This game is awesome i wish more people played. Id like to see more upgrades and modes develope.
2121	1	a	For the price it can't be beat. To be honest i would have paid $10 for this game. It's simple but challenging and fun. it also, if accidentally, has a comedic side to it. Though there are some bugs and the controls of the large dinos can be clunky it's still great. Generally, the flaws are unnoticeable during play. I highly recommend ORION: Prelude.
5178	1	a	Really,kind of good game
4116	1	a	Very addictive.
5165	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that I recommend because: - it is a method to banish boredom - it has a good price - it is indie - it has dinosaurs - it has adventure - it has co-op mode - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
2606	1	a	Awesome game especially for not even a buck Orion &gt; McDouble
3601	1	a	Its still after all this drama a good game!
4941	1	a	HOLY !@#$ THIS GAME IS THE GREATEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. DISREGARD THE METASCORE!
1763	1	a	This is a very interesting game! 'BEEP' is a game for kids who want to learn some smartness! :D
2348	1	a	THIS GAME was pretty so so, yeah, my friends didn't want to play it anymore
620	1	a	I normally hate tower defense games but this one is amazing!
1163	1	a	I, for one, do not condone the genocide of these orcian refugees, but these radical orc terrorists keep trying to cross into our land! We can't have that, now can we?
953	1	a	And oh how they must die. And by so many methods! A great game that tests the ingenuity of your trap placement to maximize the rate of destructive carnage against many enemy types. It's also very accessible for those with limited time, as levels usually lasts less than 15 minutes.
1616	1	a	STORM IS LITERALLY IN THE TEACUP.
3145	1	a	This sheit is tight yo. Play the role of extinction and laugh at god for doing so
6050	0	a	Although it was a decent effort, this game's mechanic are not the best. The game feels rather clunky and has a large time gap in between survival rounds. In addition, there is a lack of game mode variety available in this game. Due to this, my attention deviated from this game in less than an hour. In conclusion, I would not reccomend buying this game even though I got it for $1.49.
6305	1	a	Game Play is GOOD
5378	1	a	Honestly this game isn't that bad. it has a wonderful concept but if it had better graphics and less bugs it'd be godly in my books.
3106	1	a	I love the gameplay, but it's full of bugs, too bad there is only players servers, if there was a matchmaking this will be great
1720	1	a	Pretty decent scroller. It doesn't have controller support(it uses the mouse to aim), but the style is pretty fun anyway.
4278	1	a	Good, but a bit hard.
2978	1	a	please make it for free because it is a very awesome game plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
257	1	a	It was really fun to play, story is kind of good, graphics and gameplay are really nice.
723	1	a	This game is simply a must-play for anyone even remotely interested in the tower defense genre. Orcs Must Die blends together strategic trap placement and 3rd person action seamlessly as it delivers a short but sweet experience that you will not soon forget.
3633	1	a	Very fun gushies
2490	1	a	Awesome Game, for the price you pay it is absolutely amazing
3987	1	a	Still debating if my $1.50 was really worth it or not. hilaribad
4611	0	a	I dont know what i bought it was 99 cents
1033	1	a	Tower defense meets FPS, really fun.
42	0	a	I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.
1981	1	a	Interesting arcade with funny voices 'woop-peep-peep' :D
1526	0	a	the game is mediocre at best, the concept is kinda cool but not worth $10 i only payed $5 cause of summer sale thank god but even then i wish i didnt buy it. The story is painfuly boring and lack of creativity and the upgrades in the game do very little. As for all the people ahving trouble with the origin account? i logged in once and played the game smoothly ever since the only thing is it said i wasnt logged in everytime i started the game but to be honest i just wanted to finish the game to see how it ended (it was a dissappointing ended obviously lol) and the save game was never an issue. I dont recommend this game because its blan and boring go spend your money on something better. Hope this helps :)
101	1	a	Solitaire mixed with Poker. Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage. This system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -&gt; do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use. As for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the 'Overture' in the title. The art style is quite good though. In all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.
5987	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a cheap and fun indie game. If you like horde mode games, then you'll love this one. Stand off with up to 4 team mates against ever increasing hordes of dinosaurs and boss dinosaurs. Upgrade your weapons/abilities as the rounds progress. It's a fun little time waster and great with friends!
874	1	a	Traps, weapons, minions, towers, and (of course) orcs abound in this third-person tower defence game. The dialogue is surprisingly funny and adds a bit of zest to the already-fun task of creating the world's least orc-friendly castle hallways.  Tip: Use a row of wall blades and tar pits (with some barricades, if necessary) to create a single-file orc slaugherhouse. It's as much fun to build as it is to watch in action.
3227	1	a	Got this game as a gift, very fun game. 8/10
3814	1	a	This is one of my favorite dinosaur games the graphics is amazing the vehicals in this game are like halo vehicals also like the charactors like like halo this is a halo and a dinosaur game conbined you can fly as well with a jet pack and it is also game of the year and im going with that it is the best game of the year 
4581	1	a	Joins hard difficulty server that starts off with little cash Doesnt buy a weapon for a round Finally gets a few perks and has a little money left over Buys Cryoknife 1 Shots all mid sized raptors plays 3 rounds and buys perks 40 minutes later STILL USING THE $2000 KNIFE THAT I BOUGHT ON ROUND 2 20 minutes later Finally gets $40k for a fancy VTOL helicopter Gets less kills and less money with a Helicopter compared to a knife  Best investment ive ever made in my entire life...
371	0	a	Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.  The game has some very nice video's that hype the game up to levels if completely fails to reach when you finally start playing the game. And while this is not appearant at first. It slowly start sinking in after about 2 - 3 levels of this non-stop ogre killing.  To be honest, it's trying to be a tower-defence game but utterly fails at it as there are worse looking titles out there that are more fun and more challenging.  The game runs on most computers, looks nice, has some funny animations at times, but utterly fails at delivering any type of gameplay that was promised. Well, to correct myself, fails to deliver any type of gameplay that is FUN and was promised.  Recommandation is to go buy warcraft 3 and play tower defence there.  Rating 9 of 100
4567	0	a	jesus christ i know its cheap but you can buy a bag of â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the same price and you would be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of
5728	0	a	:(
3036	1	a	Best dollar game I have ever bought.
3328	1	a	Great game for the money, but don't expect much more than shooting dinos with various weapons.
4273	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
6443	1	a	for 1 $ perfect . if u want new special effects your not gonna find them here some levels have borderlands 2 graphics (reminds me of it) lvl up system different game modes 3 classes well i enjoyed the free weekend so far . 1$ for this funny game or 60$ for a new one :)  edit.: i forgot to say there is a Ingame Shop which seems to offer 'custom gear and colors' for real money they are not relevant to gameplay or balance but the hats and colors are only bought not earnd in a free way.
2919	1	a	This is definitely a fun game. Easy to learn after about 15 minutes of messing with everything that you have access to. The best weapons are late in the game so you'll have to be patient with pea-shooters. Each weapon does have its own unique set of characteristics but overall, I have quenched my thirst for killing dinosaurs - like no other game can! Thanks N!N and the Orion dev team(s)!
1456	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
4604	0	a	I'm not going to rate Orion Prelude positively, as I found it to be lacking in different aspects such as soundtrack, regular updates, optimization, animation, ai, balance, etc. I will however say that you may as well give it a try with friends now that it is free
5254	1	a	Very Cheap and Fun.... for a few hours.
2331	1	a	Stole the lightsaber sound from star wars 8/8
1454	1	a	The art style and gameplay is just amazing. I love it so far, very action-packed, good platformer. Good job Klei!
4826	1	a	like halo... but with Dinos 8/8
2247	1	a	If you have Â£0.99 its a must buy! Better yet buy 4 copies for Â£2.99 then you can give them too your friends when they ask why you don't come outside anymore... I see dead dino's... and I love it.
5944	1	a	Halo meets Dinosaurs, the warthogg and the scorpian tank are pretty good.
6188	1	a	i really like this game but i have tons of lag as of right now.once when i get a new/better pc/laptop it will be one of my fav/top 10 games i would play all the time
3377	1	a	This game reinvented the genre of railroad building tycoons for me! It is such a fast paced, off the wall rail shooter that really shines when it comes to famliy building exercises. The game is centered around an unnamed protagonist who is giving birth during a dinosaur attack. Now if that sounds crazy this will really knock your caboose right off your sockle doos, you are black!!!1111!!11!1!!1   Only if you decide to heal people like a little buttpooplickingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. This game is a great baby care taking simulator because it has everything that a little rhino would need in order to get a hexakill and get 123125 AP. This game is also a great addition to anyone's collection of games because it redefines the entire genre of tower defense!!! Without only 0 towers to place you have to be sure to place them in very strategical places in order to stop those pesky brazillians from breaking into the dunkin donuts across the street from you. All in all this is a fantastic game that all pregnant mothers should pick up instantly!      Also includes one free C-Section.
1946	1	a	Very Nice Game! 10/10!
159	1	a	Most Tower Defense games are a fairly hands-off genre; you build towers and they do their thing, with your involvement being where to put them and when to upgrade. But lately there have been some that let the player get into the action more personally, and Orcs Must Die is a great example of that. Compared to the nameless protagonists of the last two games, OMD puts you in the shoes of the Apprentice, one of many War Mages tasked with defending rifts to the human world from bands of invading orcs. His tutelage has come to an end though, thanks to his master taking a fatal tumble, forcing him into the role completely. As the Apprentice is a combination of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast and Groose from Skyward Sword, this isn't necessarily a good thing, especially not when the orcs seem to be getting more organized suddenly.  Instead of defending whole territories like other games, each level in Orcs Must Die takes place in a different fort, with a rift on one end and the orcs (as well as other enemies) charging in through the other. So rather than towers, you'll be placing down booby traps instead: spike traps on the floor, walls that shoot out arrows, even swinging maces you can put on low ceilings. It's not too hard to create a total death course enemies will futilely try to wade through. The game's combo system, the ragdoll physics, and the orcs' voice clips as they're being pulverized all help encourage this very well. The Apprentice also has some weapons of his own for crowd control, or the odd enemy that manages to get through your traps.  Each level offers up to five skulls, four for not taking any damage and one for speed, which you can use to upgrade your traps permanently. These range from extra damage on some, to slowing enemies, to dramatically increasing speed. It can make many traps much more useful, although what you spend can't be refunded. The game has 24 levels, which I beat in about ten hours. That unlocks the Nightmare difficulty, which offers tougher enemy placement and much less time to prepare between waves. I didn't find the base game that difficult, so it's a nice option if you want it. There's also some cheap DLC, which offers a few extra tools and some new levels; nothing necessary, but good if you want to get a bit more out of the game. And with one this well-made, there's not much reason you wouldn't.
6428	1	a	For what you pay, its a great multiplayer experience. The different species of dino is the basic wave monster fodder, and the classes and abiliites are also the usual suspects as well. However, the game offers a great amount of customizability, and allows you to adjust your loadout to meet your own personal preferences. The weapons handle well, and although I had my favorites, there weren't any I hated or couldn't stand. I played this game two years back when during its first free weekend, and it has come a long way since then. It sticks to what works, and the price is more than reasonable.  8.7/10 I don't know what I am doing, or how the dinosaurs got there, but I am more than happy to keep killing them.
1876	1	a	&gt; Killed a robot &gt; Chopped him apart &gt; Grabbed his leg &gt; Killed his waifu with his own leg &gt; This game has fully trained and prepared me and i feel that i am now ready for my new life of pursuing a career as a full time Robot.  For real: This game has a phenomenal environment, and world is beautiful and very detailed.
4410	1	a	its an fun amazing chaotic game!
5426	0	a	Things I didnt like about the game:  Played for the trading cards, which are dirt poor in value. No anime No anime â¥â¥â¥â¥ No anime butts No anime   -Gibus Sniper
673	1	a	One of the most helarious tower defence games Iâve played. I do very much enjoy this genre and orcs must die does shine as one of the best. Even though the gore and the graphics design is 'cartoony'; mowing down the hord with well placed traps or jumping into the frey with a meele weapon is still extremely satisfying. The humor is well done but taylored for younger players with reasonably subtle hints to more adult subjects. The plot is simple but entertaining non the less. The maps can be quite fendish but once you work out the best arrangement it all falls into place and you can work on that high score.
2283	1	a	These developers man. Selling this game for $0.99? This game is better developed than any early access and most recent full release titles. Well worth the amount you spend on it if you have a friend to play with.
4504	0	a	The worst game i ever bought! Bad graphics, not at all fun game mode, ugly looking character, not creative weapons and the boring dragons.
645	1	a	Great game, only wish it it had more levels and mutiplayer support. Very satisfying to setup a great defense and watch the orcs get slaughtered.
2881	1	a	When dinosuars existed they shot guns at them just like this.
1210	1	a	Not a good port, seems better suited to xbox arcade or something. Still liked it however. Get it cheap.
475	1	a	It's a fun game, lots of ways to kill things!
3747	0	a	theres a reson it costs a dolllar
3838	0	a	A long time a go, I bought this game, 4 pack, because my friend also request it, but it turns out only 1 who really want it, so i keep the other 2, for trading purpose, but that was a mistake, nobody want this game, time after time this game price is decreased from 15$ into 1$, that was shocking, THAT WAS A HUGE LOSS. well, if that wasn't crazy enough, this game is free to play now, GGWP 10/10 will never use a game as investation again                                                        
4465	1	a	  Not a bad game. It runs well on my ancient box too. I wished we could play as dinosaurs though.
1731	1	a	Who buys this at full price.
2599	1	a	at first i didn't know what to expect from this game. i just had a little money left so i thought sure why not buy it. it was tricky at first because i didnt know how to play and i don't really play these kinds of games anyway so i wasn't to sure to think wether it was good or bad. a group of players helped me with learning how to play and from that moment on i started really liking this game. the dinosaur gameplay i wasn't to crazy about but i loved the weapons. jet packs, mech suits, tanks and things that unleash hell XD. to top it off there are also dinosaurs ofcourse! :D  so yes i do recommend this game it's pretty good for the price...
2508	1	a	Many dinosaurs, weapons and game modes ! To take urgent !
2748	1	a	How to play this game: Pull out a gun, load it and shoot your head off. I played this game and i got molested by a T-Rex 11/10
1655	0	a	I get it, small, compact, limitless, indie. But it doesn't make it fun or especially intereseting I'm afraid.
5189	1	a	I've never shouted 'WHOOOOOOOO!' so much while playing a game.    Ever.    10/10.
4470	0	a	its graphics are terrible and its gameplay sucks
2281	1	a	this is one of those games that makes you want to take a bath with a toaster 10/10
554	1	a	A new twist on tower defense games and I feel like it's the best out there. Great diffculity
933	1	a	Tower defense is really growing on me lately and this is essential massacre fun. The traps require lots of strategy and many games will leave you on edge taking out the few who make it through everything. Later on you focus on traps on increasing your own power to deal with the invasions yourself! Nice variety of orcs too.
5735	0	a	Watch as this review gets stolen and get put into the game.
3974	1	a	Rustalions always had a issue with 'The Dinos' this game helps teach my Rustalions warriors how to 'Deal' with them.
5218	1	a	It's not bad.
4199	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
2015	1	a	This is an amazing game definitely worth that 21cents on sale, this game not only is a good 2d platformer but in harder levels it gets physics. But with 21 cents and free trading cards for profit. Nothing can go wrong!!!!!!!!!  Definitely Recommend this game!
1122	1	a	BOSS this game is BOSS. 
6223	0	a	this is awful
117	1	a	  Orcs Must Die! is a fun and simple tower defense game:    - Casual and easy to learn: you can play for less than an hour and still have fun! - Lots of different orcs to kill: melee orcs, range orcs, flying orcs, etc. - Lots of different ways to kill orcs: weapons, powers, traps, and guardians
5786	1	a	ORION: Prelude is one of the best games I have ever played thats under 15 dollars. This game should be $10.00, definitly would recomend. Buy it.
2287	1	a	Like this game came out of nowhere. It was truly outrageous. Phill Fish really knocked it out of the park. Cancelling Fez 2 was worth after he made this magnificent masterpiece. Truly the best game i've ever played in my entire life.  à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â_âà¼½ã¤
445	1	a	A lot of games try to blend tower defense and action-based gameplay. This is one of the few titles that actually pulls it off, with a quirky sense of humor to boot.  On the other hand, the game is rather short, and could use moddability and/or custom levels. Replayability is, accordingly, rather limited.

17	1	a	Runespell Overture (Card/Poker/RPG/Strategy Hybrid)  For options we have Graphics Quality (Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, and Fantastic), Windowed or Fullscreen, Drag and Drop or Click and Click (when moving cards around), and Sounds (Music and SFX). You can also choose a screen resolution anywhere from 640x480 to 1920x1080.  The tutorial is very well-done, teaching you the ropes without being annoying.  So what kind of game is this? It looks like an RPG that you play with cards, but that's not it at all. The primary thrust is actually a solitaire game... It's battle-solitaire-poker with RPG elements! *evil grin* Whee~!  How does that work? Looking at the screenshots will help a bit. As you can see, we and our opponent are each dealt a set of cards, solitaire-style. Ours is on top, theirs is on the bottom. We need to create poker hands by grouping cards in sets of five. If you don't know the poker hands, no worries -- the game will show you what groupings are 'legal' to play. Each 'hand' will deliver a certain amount of damage, depending on the cards you've chosen. For instance, a pair of cards (the other three cards in the group would be non-related) will deliver less damage than a flush.   In each round, you have three moves, and then your opponent gets three moves.   But wait, there's more!   You can steal your opponent's cards, and vice versa! If you grab a card from his area (or the other way around,) the card underneath does NOT flip over until it becomes his turn, but whenever you clear a pile on your side, you can immediately have access to whatever card is next in the pile (assuming that it's still your turn.) You CAN'T grab more than a single card from each others' piles -- if something is stacked on the other side (grouped,) it's off-limits to you. You can of course move multiple, grouped cards around on your own side.  Here's an example of how it might work:   You already have three Kings grouped, and take a fourth King to add to the pile, then grab a King from your enemy's cards to make five-of-a-kind (yes, unlike real poker, you can have five of the same card.) You use your third turn to select the five kings and deal damage.  This is where the strategy comes in. Now that it's too late and you've used all of your turns, you see your adversary grab that Jack of Hearts from your cards to complete a Royal Flush! EEEK~!!  Here's what you could have done to prevent it and still get your five Kings:   Forget about your three Kings for right now, grab his king, and place it on your single King, making a pair. Grab the Jack of Hearts and put it on top of another card -- ANY other card! It's better if you can do something with it, of course, but the point is to keep that card AWAY from your opponent. Now you can do one of two things: Do something beneficial (like moving a card to help yourself and/or hurt his progress) or you can move the pair of Kings on top of the three-of-a-kind, and make your attack in an upcoming round.  But wait, there's more!   Along the way we earn (via battles) and find special-use cards that can do anything from give you extra moves before your turn is over to poisoning to shielding yourself, to adding to your hit points, and more! You can only have a certain number of cards with you at the time of each battle, and (most of) the cards have finite-uses. When they run out uses, you can use the money you earn to recharge the cards.  Be sure to SAVE before each battle! You can abandon your progress if you wish -- it's an option to exit or go back to the main menu without saving.  There a bit more to it than that, including a storyline, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. ;)  This game was a huge surprise to me -- I never expected it to be so fun and addictive! A definite thumbs-up from me!
466	1	a	Strangely addictive - and it's funny!
2601	1	a	The real questions is...  Would you pay $1 to pilot a helicoptor firing missile swarms at a Tyrannasaurus Rex?  Why, Yes. Yes I Would.
4970	0	a	There's a reason its a dollar...
547	1	a	Great game. Addictive tower defense style-game with a decent amount of variation between weapons, towers, maps, and mobs. Recommend for any tower defense lover.
5267	0	a	I can't even turn the res below 1000x32 and i have a bad pc.
6046	1	a	Super fun game! The co-op gameplay is freaking awesome, i brought this game for $1.50 and it's worth more than that for sure. I also host an Aus server when i play so feel free to join me.   7/10 for gameplay 1/10 story (there is no story) 4/10 Animations(they are pretty bad on raptors) 8/10 FPS  Overall 6/10(For steam summer sale 10/10)   If you are thinking of buying this for steam summer sale you will not regret it
908	1	a	Have you noticed how Tower Defense has become like FPS used to be? A new one launches every week. This game sets itself out from the pack by having you play over the shoulder or first person. Good amount of comedy. Nice graphics. You get to kill, maime, and roast Orcs. What isn't there to like?
4313	1	a	Worst FPS i have ever played! But cuz i love huge cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥s that dont make sense i give this game 10/10 Bad game! But good game..........Im bored..........seriously im bored............
1369	1	a	The most fun co-op mode I've ever played. End of discussion!
1968	1	a	EDIT: THIS WAS FIXED! :D Thank you Developers! Before you read: I have tried to send this to the support email, but I couldn't find it. I would recommend this game but as soon as I start it up it crashes. It gives me a blank white screen and a pop up. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium. 64 bit operating system. I bought the game for 2 of my friends and myself. Seems to work for them but not for me. I'll change this review to positive once this is fixed.  This is what it says:    Problem signature:  Problem Event Name: APPCRASH  Application Name: BEEP.exe  Application Version: 0.0.0.0  Application Timestamp: 4de80ab3  Fault Module Name: fmodex.dll  Fault Module Version: 0.4.32.3  Fault Module Timestamp: 4cadf0ad  Exception Code: c0000005  Exception Offset: 00019edd  OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.768.3  Locale ID: 1033  Additional Information 1: f15c  Additional Information 2: f15c5f683107b4382ab134b3b30e3b0a  Additional Information 3: f589  Additional Information 4: f589e7c3cb2c3feb155ce682264d5b67   
3439	1	a	A fun, Action, Adventure, and educational to how Dinosaur's hunting habits in a way. :3
1746	1	a	Simple, colorful yeah may be too much simple but it has a gravity gun! Give it a change
2154	1	a	A poorly-made, unashamedly dumb game that nevertheless offers equally dumb entertainment.   Pros:  -Drop-in co-operative multiplayer  -Multiple classes  -Customized loadouts (when unlocked)  -Many upgrade paths once in game  -Vehicles! Tanks, Mechs, and VTOLs if you're lucky enough to survive long enough to find them  -Lots of achievements. You can actually unlock vanity items with enough of them!   Cons:  -Occasional crashes  -Discouraging higher difficulties without teammates or unlocks  -Lack of servers  -Somewhat monotonous level design
6283	1	a	The BEST game of 2012
3079	1	a	If you seek a game full of fun and none stop dino hordes then this is your game, ORION: Dino Horde is a great dino survival, it has many gamemodes which are multiplayer and contains fun weapons and viechels. It is an easy game to get into and can be good for tornaments and other activities.
5270	0	a	Had to buy ths game and then they make it free to play what a rip off this game is loads of fun but the dev have a long history of changing this games name to avoid the fact that they steal assets from other games.... but is a fun game once you get past the scumbagry of the devs 10/10 would get ripped off again
664	1	a	ORCS MUST DIE! Kil them how u want!
191	1	a	Ultimate time-eater. Probably even better then Plants vs. Zombies in this aspect. Get it and you won't regret it.
629	1	a	Very addictive, gotta beat those top scores.
4670	1	a	What a blast to play with friends. Some minor annoyances allong the way but for &lt;1$ I reccomend this to any and all people
5411	0	a	Very laggy and slow. IDK if it's my computer or not.
3308	1	a	I fap to this well spent 0,99$
5906	0	a	Wow this game is bad..... 
4039	1	a	Imagine Killing Floor...BUT DINOSAURS AND JETPACKS!!!!!! 10/9  A T-Rex eated me and i deaded.  SO MANY LAUGHS with friends. Must get. Especially when it goes on sale for $0.99. Good dollar spent.
6062	1	a	Great game, love the multiplayer mode. You can enjoy it for hours at once.
1978	1	a	I killed my time with this game. 8/10
3399	1	a	WOW, this reminds me of unreal tournament and at the moment just 79 its incredible value, fight against dinosaurs or other human players, fantastic 
2398	1	a	Best game I ever played.
1544	0	a	Good Point : Fun Puzzle Bad Point : Boss Battle, really, really really HARD
3603	0	a	Feels like a PS2 game, very clunky and basic.  Devellopers are thiefs and fire their employees with no pay and steal 3D models and assets from other games.  Do not buy even for 1$ and do not buy their future â¥â¥â¥â¥ products
6067	1	a	Actually a lot better than the reviews would say, it is great fun in local co-op!
4896	1	a	meh. better than cod i guess
4424	0	a	i cant even launch game it constantly crashes what do I do?
1604	0	a	Very repetitive graphics and gameplay. Boring after a few hours. Feel bad that I spent what I did. Maybe worth $1.
6026	1	a	Got eaten by dinosaurs  10/10
820	1	a	Fun and hilarious!! Worth every penny.
791	1	a	Are you a MASSIVE racist that hates orcs for no rational reason? CONGRATULATIONS! Play this game, and you will have your reason, because they're being bad and invading your rift. You are a loveable idiot (So just like real life), who can dance like nobody's business, and he's humanity's LAST HOPE against the incoming Orc threat. Set traps, headshot orcs, and become the orc-discriminatory hero that the Rift needs.
3445	0	a	10/10 would recommend
5852	1	a	this game is soo cheap that i recomended that you should buy it cuz so cod graphics u can even 360 no 4325432 no scope in the game if you added hacks to yea, cheap 99 cents mlg pro sniper gamex. recomended to be a mlg game. included dinos but u can no scope player also
2181	1	a	it's not bad.. but it's not great. They tried to mix Halo with a Dino hunt. Good graphics except when they aren't. Good controls that suddenly seem to stop working. (shaking head) I hold final opinon cause it's consistantly getting updates and changes. But get it cheep dudes.
4607	1	a	its a fun little game if you can get some of your friends together, and with its cheap price its nearly impossible to say no... Now all i need to do is make some freinds...
3494	0	a	This game is literally not even a game. Like, what gives, dude. I played for thirty minutes and could not join a game and it would constantly crash. Then, I actually join in a 'game' and see nothing and I have to run 2500m to get to the 'playing' area. Then, there were dinosaurs and they
4523	1	a	Best game for 1$ you can find on steam.
4364	1	a	You can ride an entire mech ontop of a VTOL in this at full speed - it's seriously ridiculous fun.  It's unpolished, but the old reviews don't take into account that this game has gone a long way through updates.  It's cheap, with lots of content and gamemodes sure to keep you playing for many hours.  While it has buggy animations and other small problems, it's still a really fun game and the scale of fighting huge dinosaurs is fun - refreshing from the zombie game crowd.  Lots of gamemodes, maps, and things to do.
223	1	a	Orcs Must Die! 2 is one of my all time favourite games. So when I checked out the original Orcs Must Die!, I was pleasantly surprised. This game is pretty much just Orcs Must Die! 2 singleplayer, and if you're a fan of the sequel, you should definently check this game out. 9\10, and yes I am a fanboy.
4570	1	a	This Game Is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Awesome!  Pros:   You can kill dinosaurs. There are tanks. There are helicopters. You can knife dinosaurs. There is a giant â¥â¥â¥â¥ing aligator. You can play with friends. You can knife dinosaurs. You can fly around in a jetpack You can knife dinosaurs. You can get hit by a dinosaur and launch 5000ft in the air. You can knife dinosaurs. Lots of guns. Lots of boss dinosaurs. Lots of game modes.    Cons:   This game is awesome. 10/10 And if you didnt know   YOU CAN KNIFE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOSAURS    
4687	1	a	Awesome game! Soldiers with hi-tech weapons and equipment against Dinos is just soooo cool hahah!! Really fun game, there are a few bugs here and there but It wont be a waste of money if you like First Person Shooter games AND KILLING T-REXes!! Plus the GMs are really active, so if there's any bug and they find out, they'll fix it as soon as possible!!
1514	1	a	WARP is a stealth-action puzzler where players take control of little alien who is abducted by humans and must find his way out from research facility. He must use powers of other aliens to accomplish this task while completing different puzzles and defeating his enemies. While game may last only 3-4hours itâs actually great and enjoyable. There are 3 different powers to wield and amazing locations. Also to note you can collect grubs that can help you upgrade your powers like walking more silent or just make better use of your abilities. Finally after completing story you can try out challenge room to test your skills and manage to kill enemies as quick as possible. While it may be a poor port from console it still manages to hold on high spot as good indie game. The only flaw may occur is that you are required to have Origin account, and maybe for better gameplay use controller. Otherwise great game to enjoy and relax. 8/10-Overall. 7/10-PC version. 
361	1	a	Killing Orks! Not as Spacemarine this time, but still with a Warhammer, if you preordered.  The Game is comparable to Sanctum, but has a lot more levels and depth. You get an insane amount of Traps, Levels and also Perks later in Act 2. I really enjoy it.  Could have more Achievements though :p.
4310	0	a	Sucks. You get what you pay for.
2570	1	a	very good for this price you can pick it!
655	1	a	Pretty Cool Tower Defence! Its a little bit challenging i love that!Can't wait to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
5389	1	a	*Steam Workshop *Achievements *Cards *CO-OP *Great Graphics *FUN I dare you to find a game as good as ORION: Prelude for $1.
2053	1	a	Beep is an attractive indie platform game that suffers from somewhat frustrating controls.
1884	0	a	it is not loading right
2298	1	a	gameplay 1/3 story 9/1 graphics 2.14/6 moms 8/4  Overall 10/10 Game of the last year
2817	1	a	Imagine playing a version of HALO 2 where you can obliterate raptors with the gun from RoboCop.  That's what it's like playing ORION: Dino Horde.  And I'm okay with this.
1201	1	a	This game is much more fun than it has any right to be. It's a blend of the Tower Defense and First Person Shooter genres, it's extremely frenetic, and the main character is an entertainingly over-the-top â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you're not sure about it, grab it when it's on sale; it's a pretty minor investment for a solid game.
5967	0	a	Seems like if turok and halo had a baby (the first or second halo of course, because the graphics, i think that i could even run it on my celeron). The blood is bad as s**t, but... it was 0.99â¬ and is the type of game you'll give for your girlfriend play when she on her period, she'll love it!
5630	1	a	You run around and shoot dinosaurs, teammates optional. WARNING! you may see senses that look like direct outtakes from Avartar, if you don't like that movie, try not to think about it.
1451	1	a	Still damn fun!. But sadly the story is so bad compare to the first one.
6405	1	a	Just sniped a Trex . 10/10 would do that again . Definitely worth it and it's just 1 dollar :D
2370	0	a	if u want good graphics this is not a choice for u
4148	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
4645	1	a	Great game play it with friends :DDD
5509	0	a	I bought this game two years ago and never played now I hear these mo'fo's are stealling from other devs yall some skeeving dirty little theifs! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME dont support trash.
448	1	a	Hello, Gamers.  Look at your Steam Library, now back to mine, now back at your Library, now back to mine. Sadly, yours isn't mine.  Why? Because if you stopped for a moment with all of your other games, you could be bisecting, stabbing, flaming and otherwise giving hordes of Orcs a very bad day, all while having an absolute blast of a time.  Okay, I'm horrible at copying Old Spice commercials... Orcs Must Die! is a game that describes itself right in its title, there's you, there's the Orcs, the latter must die. The fun is in how you have them die. The game is blindingly simple, the 'plot' is idiotically brilliant, and it's fun all around.  Kind of like Warhammer Fantasy.
3812	1	a	Fantastic game! â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off? Go kill some dinos. Wanna punch a dino in the face? Go kill some dinos. Trying to impress the girl of your dreams? Show her how well you kill some dinos! A great play for any day!
4792	1	a	Extremely poorly made game. Devs obviously have no idea what they are doing. â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor visuals. Utterly disgusting gun sounds.  The game even has an in game cash shop where you can buy hats and looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!
1065	1	a	One of the best tower defense games out there. It has a lot of variety and you feel rewarded for progressing through the game.  10/10
3339	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing best, Shooting dinosaurs whiel flying around. 50 cents? are you kidding me this is the deal of the century.
5034	1	a	This game is definitely worth the price of a few cents. If played with friends it is extremely fun, however that won't cover the fact that the animations in the game were sloppy and jittery, the graphics were low poly, and the hud was too transparent. Yet despite all of that I really enjoyed playing the game definite reccomend.  TL;DR: Buy it to play with friends, it is like dino zombie survival.
597	1	a	Love the game. Keep up the good work :)
4865	1	a	Move over Turok, there's a new batch of Dino slayers!
4069	1	a	I regretted not buying this when it's on sale. Who wouldn't want to fight dinosaurs?
5693	0	a	Game is still â¥â¥â¥â¥.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As all ways wanna see what games I am playing now then follow and view my stream @  twitch.tv/spitroasted 
5516	1	a	It is awsome when you play with friends
4750	1	a	It is a great game, but i am unfortunately no longer able to play it (not enough RAM) which is sad, due to the obvious amount of great content.
249	1	a	Greate Game!  Much better than the sequel, because in the sequel you get the feeling, that the traps are ineffective.
2759	1	a	Truly one of the best ever games i have ever ever played, the graphics are amazing and the gameplay highly enjoyable, minecraft has nothing on this shooter.
1618	1	a	Whimsy! If you're looking to add some whimsy to your life, this is a great choice. If not, this probably won't be your cup of tea (haha). The gameplay is very simple - you're a dude who floats around in a magic teacup collecting sugar cubes and stickers and avoiding obstacles. Obstacles include lava, angry clouds, pits and various pointy things which cause instant death. What I think makes SIT special is that there is a meter that controls your ability to jump/float that rapidly depletes when you press jump but immediately starts to fill when you release it. This means that you can do a variety of midair maneuvers such as changing directions and jumping higher than you would expect. You can customize your little dude with stickers you collect (mostly just color choices, but boy, do I enjoy the different colors of magic teacup trails). There are a few different game modes. Story mode is 40 levels with no unifying theme per cluster of levels and no appreciable increase in difficulty. Some levels sprinkled in are randomly a little more difficult, but nothing frustratingly so. There is some variety as far as grassy level, boat level, underground level but like I said, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to level order. A few levels add wind obstacles or little shooting mini games and I guess this is called story mode because there are a few pictures at the very beginning and there is a quasi boss battle at the end. The 10 bonus levels add a cool new element - blocks that allow you to rotate the level. Survival mode consists of 5 levels of collecting sugar for two minutes while avoiding obstacles. You get an achievement for collecting 30 sugars in each, but I collected 50 in each in only a few tries. Challenge mode is 5 reworked levels that you have already played that have more obstacles thrown in to make them more of a challenge.   Tips &amp; Tricks - So this is the first Steam game that I have unlocked all the achievements on. They are pretty straightforward except for 3. I got the no jump achievement on level 21. (It isn't possible on many of the levels because you cannot reach the goal without jumping unless there are wind boosts on that level). I got the no sugar achievement on level 12. (Again this is not possible on every level because the sugar cubes are often between you and the goal). Lastly, I was stumped at first as to how to get the achievement for perfecting the credits level because the credits did not roll after completing story mode or after completing the bonus levels, although there was a congratulations screen after each. To play the credit level, pick Cobra from the main menu and then click on credits. (Weird).  Bottom line - Whimsy! Fun, not overly challenging but decent challenge if you are going for all the achievements which requires perfects on the levels. A nice little diversion. If you're looking for something low stress and sugar-coated, I definitely recommend this. I picked this up during the summer sale for $0.74, so just keep an eye out during the upcoming fall and winter sales if you are interested.
1756	1	a	BEEP is a good little platformer that would be awesome if it had controller support. It also lacks a menu, meaning no settings of any kind. These 2 things really keep BEEP from being a great platformer. Platformers are meant to be played with a controller, imo and settings(windowed mode, sound) are nice options to have too. As is 5/10, would be 8/10 if it was complete.      
661	1	a	Play the first one, tons of fun. Do NOT buy the second one, omg snooze-fest almost immediately. Complete and utter sequel fail. So crushingly dissappointed.
5590	1	a	Really, realy stupid
3946	1	a	This game is so good i give it 9 360 no scopes out of ten. This game is better then call of duty.
1703	1	a	It's just nice to play, the game constantly shows you what you have to do and it's still challenging. The sound effects are super cute and it's just a fun game. Sometimes you have to think back to the very beginning of the tutorial in order to progress, that way it shows you how to combine different techniques. I find Beep very adorable, maybe because his sound effects remind me of R2-D2 :D
5271	1	a	this game is good it came out on my birthday
602	1	a	It is a relly fun game ^-^
183	1	a	fun and entertaining, worth getting if on sale. all around good game 
3670	1	a	If this game was a dinosaur it would be a 'pretty-good-for-a-dollarsaurus.'

6474	1	a	Ummm... yes please B^U
1788	1	a	Simple but addictive Game, 10/10 Amazing for its price. Would love to see a multiplayer ;)
676	1	a	Holy crap this game is addicting. Now at the time of writing this recommendation, I haven't beaten it yet...BUT...man this game is just sooooo good. It's just...cuz...like....URRRGGHH! Tower defense gameplay, with third person shooter gameplay. GReAT mix. The graphics are awesome, sound/music is great, and level design hits the sweet spot. You've GOT to get this game. I was able to get this when it was on sale and MAN what a steal that was. HIGHLY recommend this game. Lot's of fun ^_^
5893	1	a	A T-Rex crushed me while I tried to punch it to death. 8/8 would lag again
1135	1	a	its a medevil game and also a magical game Its preaty awsome and is a survival sort of game i recommend the game 10/9.6
2423	1	a	I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.
1905	0	a	I HATE IT I WASTED 5 EMOTICONS FOR 30 CENTS AND USED 25 ON IT!!!!!!!!!
4565	1	a	If you're a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like me who wants to invade dinosaur habitats and then slaughter them all for no valuable reason as they try to defend their home, then this is the game for you.  11/10 No need for meteors -IGN
3172	1	a	Uhhh, this is a bad game - and I love it. It's trashy, cheesy and a hell of fun.  Play it with friends, though.
4968	1	a	Very good action-fps game, with motion blur and all that â¥â¥â¥â¥'s.
4566	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game... -10/10
4414	0	a	Back when this game was call Dino Beatdown the game have fewer dinos the graphics were 10x better and the gameplay was smoother. Now updates dino horde and prelude came changing the game into this bloody rubbish, and a major graphics downgrade to make the pretty ok looking game look like 32bit S*h*i*T and the only good thing to come out of it was the weather effects for the snow lvls  i used to love this game in 2012 but the updates ruined it
483	1	a	Fun TD Game with orc's!
4747	1	a	Great game!!  Addicting and simple. 10/10
3585	1	a	I keep seeing reviews about steal this and theft that, who cares. 'In today's news, company sells stolen game for an entire dollar! 49 cents on sale!! What happened to this world???'  This is by far the most fun game i've ever played in this price range. A friend of mine bought it for our group of friends because it was so cheap, little did we know that it would be damn good fun.   Classes, plenty of weapons, vehicles, upgrades, lots of modes, and dinosaurs. Though i admit the graphics aren't top notch but honestly not bad, lighting and shadows aren't bad, the dinos look sorta low res but who cares. And glitches galore but thats all part of the fun if you ask me.   The only downside i can see is that probably not many people host lobbies, not sure for certain. And that all the visual upgrades for characters is handled through a slew of microtransactions, but this game is only a dollar. Atleast its not like Rockstar's wonderfully overrated and squeezed for every last penny with microtransactions GTA 5.   AAA studios take note! This is genuine fun for the whole family.
5128	1	a	I really love this game. here's why:  Pros: -ok to great graphics -wide selection of guns -wide selection of upgrades -LOTS of dinosaurs -pvp modes, which are really fun -meh to ok servers: in other words, there are lots of servers with people, lots without people -dinosaurs,dinosaurs...who doesn't like them?   Cons: -It is kind of buggy, sometimes you cant use your aibility,others you can't DO anything -dinos running away when you are down, and need to kill one to survive. It's just annoying -bug with infinite health dinos  and that's pretty much it.. so go buy this, it's totally worth $1. It should honestly cost about $100 though.. yes, it's that good.   EDIT: they fixed all the bugs, mnade the game look and play even better, and after the horrible mess it was in 2012, it improved to the greatest game of 2015. Think of your favorite FPS, and multiply it by a billiion. That's what ytou get from $0.99 Orion Prelude (or for you long term players such as me, orion: Dino horde). The game has improved so much it's unbelievable!
4333	0	a	If you're buying this game recently, don't it doesnt work.
1447	1	a	This is a good side scroller, 2D combat game. I think it is unique and if its on sale, I would reccommend it for a fun Indie game
2387	0	a	I got it for 99 cents. It's bad. Just.... bad. 
4721	1	a	this can all be decribed in one word... superfuntaculasamazeingaddictingbestthingeverdinosaursfulmazeing (pronouced- super funtaculas amazeing addicting best thing ever dinosaursful mazeing) NOW PLAY IT OR DIE OF OLD AGE!!!!1111ONE ONE ONE ONE UNO UNO UNO UNO BEARS BEARS BEARS BEARS  now walk the dinosaur
5921	1	a	It's a very good game. Fast paced action similiar to old school shooters, really fun to play.
6168	1	a	Perfect game to play with friends. Shoot at Dinosours, grenade them. Play with the settings for crazy games. You get a lot of game and fun for the price.
6366	0	a	Major update. Developers claim to have done some work on it (which i don't say they haven't). Same ol' Dino: Horde... Still not polished. Lags with relatively low dino count. I have gone from stable 60fps to 20-15fps when about 100 dinos kick in (with minimum graphics and perfectly meeting min. system specs,  
6301	1	a	this game has grown from what ever you would call the starting product , i am quite happy to have seen this game grow , its like a killingfloor type game , and for the price it is a yes from me
596	1	a	For The Following People Who Is Not A Tower Deffence Game Fan Then Don't Bother Being Negative Because People Like Me Are Fans Of Tower Deffence Games And It Mkaes Me Mad When People Thinks Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ But Clearly They Are Not TD Fans So Grow Up And Move On  I Understand Its Your Opinion Everyone Is Aloud An Opinion But Your Only Saying Your Reasons From Your Perspective
5867	1	a	Erm. Dinosaurs, jetpacks, vehicles and a lightsaber? For less than Â£1? So damn sold!
1679	1	a	Spent 30-45 minutes attempting to stack 4 dead robots from the previous areas to get to an unreachable spot,  even read the hint that was given. Stacked the lot, jumped on, then found out  that the block I was trying to get to was movable.  10/10 would waste my time gathering and stacking dead robots again.  (it's actually a really cool game that I plan to play more, buy it!)
6044	1	a	Shoot â¥â¥â¥â¥ers in the face and they die, the filty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s had it coming anyways. They aren't suppose to still be alive and they killed my mechwarrior.
5691	0	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bought it for 1 euro AND NOW ITS FREE â¥â¥â¥â¥ OFF
4730	1	a	Epic graphics, Epic weapons, Epic cars, Epic helicopters! Even better with friends!
5200	1	a	I no-scoped a T-Rex in the face.  10/10 Would 1v1 T-Rex again.
3485	1	a	Is geym of shot dinosuar. Meny fun time to have. Can have roketlaunch an go boom on dino hed. HAHA! 10/10
2228	1	a	I played this game for 25 hours striaght for Extra Life 2013, and despite the obvious exhastion of playing a video game for that long, it was a surprisingly fun experience! There was more than enough content to keep me occupied by myself for around 10 hours, and 10 more if you have friends to play with. Of course it isn't perfect, the looping music can get very repetitive, but it does a good job of getting you hyped up. As of this review, it is on sale for $0.99 and Free-to-Play, so at least give it an hour of your time, and be patient with it.
2519	1	a	We were mowing down a bunch of little annoying dinosaurs with machine guns then a giant T-rex came out of nowhere with an ear-shattering ROAAAR and ate my friend in one bite.  9/10 would watch my friend die horribly right in front of me again
2937	1	a	Its a very good game but at my PC lags. Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3240T CPU 2.90 GHz RAM: 4 GB and on board GPU. Is this normal to happen? I play games with higher system requirtments and they dont lag at low settings.
1252	1	a	My pick for Orc murder simulator GotY. Smooth, polished, and tons of fun.
2150	1	a	10/10 Achievement unlocked for no reason.
663	1	a	What I learned from this game: Orcs can get pierced, slashed, crushed, burnt, frosted, exploded, desintegrated ... and the really nice cartoony graphics make this look even funny. Recommended!
118	1	a	Nice polished fun TD/3PS. Got to finish it sometime. High quality game for cheap, what's not to like?
4529	0	a	I did not like the game
4690	1	a	For $1 it has better graphics than call of duty and less glitches than battlefield.
3834	1	a	DINO-RIFFIC 11/10 HOLY CRAPPP
4576	1	a	playing with friends, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun game :D
2468	0	a	This game just sucks, its the kind of game that a 10 yo would play, if he didnt have any other thing to play with.
3626	1	a	5/10
603	1	a	Great Game!!
307	1	a	Great combination of tower defense, rpg, and physics = amazing orc killing pc game!!
1748	1	a	So far of what I have played in this game has been amazing. This platformer is a must buy and is unique.
4255	0	a	I just got this game. I don't know wtf is going on but I can't connect to any servers. It either takes me back to the main menu or doesn't do anything at all. It won't even let me play solo mode. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
4087	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
954	1	a	Never thought that this was just a indie game. Add some tower defence with some Shooter elements and you get Orcs must die. Simple and fascinating. Sometimes it was hard but never unfair. But if you upgrades the units/traps, you will probably stick to the same strategy. So even when I finished the game, I didnt try out every trap.
5435	0	a	The Land Before Time Game is not that great without the original voice actors
2821	1	a	Great game ^^
1466	1	a	Great game! A Hack and Slash at its best! I started a blind lets play/first look on my YouTube Channel. Below is the link to my channel! Thanks for watching and let me know what you think!          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  &nbsp;
2844	1	a	Game is actually better than Call of Duty, less hackers , even not really possible to find one. Great Graphics, better animations than CoD, good Rainy Weather, even COD doesnt have that one. Good gameplay, enjoyable game with Friends over COOP.  Able to make lobby, not paytowin game , easy to play.
6027	1	a	best game ever...meta score was a lie! Better then most 60$ games!
5155	0	a	Well this is one of the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games ive played in a while I feel scamed about paying one whole doller on this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
747	1	a	what can we say, splendid splendid stuff, great fun that we keep coming back to and it's damned hard at times too!
1107	1	a	Great game, bizzaro but awesome mix of FPS and tower defense, definitely worth the sale price!
989	1	a	Very addictive tower defense game. Easy to play, hard to master. One of the best fun/cost ratio of the year. You must at least try it.
1677	1	a	WHAT IF YOU COULD PLAY A GAME INSIDE AN POWERUP INSIDE A GAME INSIDE AN ENEMY INSIDE THE WALL INSIDE AN ENEMY.
1961	1	a	BEEP has great promise in every aspect of it's game, even to the point where I was expecting it to have hairline accuracy with it's controls.  That is however one thing that you must not assume. When you aim at an enemy it auto-locks, great for shooting under cover, bad for tracking moving enemies. In this case every enemy killable, moves. Sometimes it locks at an angle where the bullets you shoot will miss regardless of where you stand, making some scenarios only passable if you lose one block of your health.  But onto the good part! I never found any puzzle that were the same. Some made me feel stupid, whereas some made me feel like a genius in the making, but no two puzzles were the same. Every obsticle you encounter is one you must figure out by yourself, whether you do it by stacking the mangled scraps of your enemies, or by propelling yourself upwards by using the tracer beam to slam the corpses up onto the underside of your BEEP.  Every 'Planet' biome has their own theme and puzzle styles that never borrow from the previous planets, allowing a fresh experience every time you move from one biome to the next. Definite plus.  This is a puzzle game It also feels like a rage game at times. no. It's a rage game.  Also I hate the insufferable flying mines that chase you....
3261	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing and the fact that they are letting you buy it for 99 cents right now is an unheard of deal in itself for a game that is this much fun. Definite must have and it's the only one type of game that you can kill waves of dinosaurs for hours on end.
4514	0	a	Nearly reached 1hr of gameplay i played 59mins in fact it was so awersome that i decided to delete it right away By the way devs i enjoyed best uninstall simulator evur gg iluminati out of 10
4006	1	a	anything with dinosaurs and guns is AWESOME
3287	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
116	1	a	Really liked this game. I'm a big sucker for card games and have wasted X amout of time on Windows Solitaire so this was a given. If you don't like poker or fantasy you shouldn't bother though.
4442	0	a	No thanks.
726	1	a	Loads of fun! Not a very long experience, unless you try to perfect every level, but totally worth it!
3676	1	a	I paid for this and now it's free. Volvo and GaybeN, explain plz
5300	1	a	Yeah, this game is weirdly fun. But it is quite broken at times.
499	1	a	A TD game with a FPS Element, slick controlls, fun houmor and great gameplay. Everything you want in a good TD/FPS combo.
4973	1	a	My friend got picked up by a pterodactyl. Then the pterodactyl dropped him and he got headbutted by a triceratops. 11/10
65	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
1076	1	a	This is such a great tower defense game. The only thing that is missing is multiplayer, it's well worth the price if you like tower defense / 3rd person defense.
4573	1	a	Least expensive time passer in a while.      10/10
3336	1	a	A great game with dinos.  + Cheap + Many game modes + Nice graphics + Classes + Design style + Many maps + Weapons + You're able to play as a dinosaur.  -/ 
2592	1	a	Glitchy for now... But it's AWESOME!  EDIT: 2015 This game... it has changed... from a Glitchy F@*% Fest.... into a formidable game... This is where my 2012 purchase went to..... it worth at least 10 USD....
2857	1	a	Ran over 10 velociraptors with jetbike and, got stuck on a tree branch and killed 10 more with nuclear revolver. 10/10
6389	0	a	I played this game when it first came out and it was really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.... I just played the new version of this game and I don't know what the difference is. Still pretty bad... But whatever. Just not for me.
6016	1	a	great game to play with friends :D
1382	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
148	1	a	Orcs Must Die is just an amazing game, you'll have a smile on my face every moment you're in game.   The title pretty much explains the basics of the game, but without mentioning the best part, the traps!  The game is a tower defence/Third person shooter in which you must defend the rift in each castle. The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.  You start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun).   At the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift.   Levels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.  The only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.  But overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.
3465	1	a	Great game so far!
6196	0	a	Possibly worse than 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' 10/10 would play games worse than WarZ again
6304	1	a	This game is awesome for its price. Great to play with friends in PvP or survival and face with a lot of bosses. 10/10 because this game is so cheap and you will get amazing experience playing Orion:Prelude
1676	1	a	You enter enemies to weaken them, powerups to improve them, yourself to fix your combos... recursively!
5781	1	a	This game is one of the best fps I've ever played, I've seen games worth way, way less then this and they cost about $30.00 to $60.00 and this is only $1.00
2727	1	a	Like Skyrim with dinosaurs. 10/10
144	1	a	I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
5028	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
3571	1	a	i love dinosaurs,when i was 5 i had a jurasic park themed bd party i had a shirt with Jurasic park logo,tons of plastic dinosaurs (i still have them) and a huge scaled jungle model now i have this sht and what can i say? just amazing,the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ t-rex ate me alive,tons of raptors and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ one that spits venom,plus the small ones(i think they re Compsognathids) that come in hordes of 10 or 20,too small to shot and too fast! 30 minutes of pure action scenarios are big too you can roam around and shot around the jungle to get objetives ,the folliage helps you and them to hide(like in real life) and you feel like a prey special effects are cool and weapons are nice pistols are my fav cheap price,great game
1582	0	a	There are more engaging tower defense games available. I had plenty of issues trying to select towers and other buttons. I had to click multiple times before selecting something only to click on the upgrade button just to have it deselect the tower. It made the gameplay rather frustrating.
6060	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.DO NOT BUY,WASTE OF MONEY,NEVER BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME,IT SUCKS,TETRIS IS BETTER THAN THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T.
4115	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
2536	1	a	This game ended slavery and cured aids..... 99/10 IGN
3098	1	a	This game is amazing, tons of fun. fighting dino's with friends, and stabbing friends in the back with an t-rex egg in gungame. i really recomend you to buy it. a litle bit buggy but that doesn't really matter.
3202	1	a	IT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5503	1	a	It has dinosaurs in it.
5042	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
512	1	a	co-op 1st person tower defense with a sense of humor, very well executed, does all it says on the tin, a great game
5461	0	a	Game contains stolen assets and is run by greedy devs, not worth giving them any money.
3337	1	a	I got this game when it was on sale for a couple of dollars, personally after playing it it would have probably been worth 3-5 times what I paid for it. I don't know why the rating score is so bad but this is a very fun game, not necessarily an enormious amount of depth, but still very fun and fairly memorable. Sometimes thats all that matters, so definetly if it goes on sale go ahead and try it, you may not LOVE it but who doesn't like killing dinosaurs :)
3598	0	a	Atleast refund the money for the people who spent money on your game before making it free. Kind of lucky i didnt buy more than 1 copy for the game.   If you didnt buy the game, go play it. It definately isnt bad, but the fact that the devs dont care that we spent money for nothing makes me not play the game now.  EDIT:  Although it has gone back to paid, Alot of people recieved the game for free, which still isnt fair
909	1	a	Best fun you can have killing Orcs...EVER!  If you don't download the demo and stop reading this...I'll send an orc army to make you!!!  Great title, excellent graphics, very polished. Runs well on even low end hardware/laptops.
2863	1	a	Fun and great to play with friends
5022	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
135	1	a	Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.  Orcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.  The gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.  The performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.  Orcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore, has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. Itâs a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.  Ratings system: For this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.  Concept: 6.5/10 Gameplay: 5.5/10 Overall: 5.5/10  Thanks for reading my review!

4552	1	a	Worth a dollar. In all other regards-... god awful.  Glitchy mess, feels like premade unity assets.. controls in general feel muddy. Could also really do with a tutorial.
3419	1	a	The metascore is â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game rules.
5075	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
1967	1	a	Pretty fun! it has some nice puzzles and the gameplay is legit!
2550	1	a	This game is a simulator taken on space where you get attacked by dinos,WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!People say this game is laggy but thats there computers problem it works perfect for me and I tried it for free and found very enjoyable so i bought premisson for teradacyles to put me on the top of the world and it was worth it,somehow.
1522	0	a	Horrible game. Doesnt even load, and no one can fix it. Not even the producers can fix it. DONT BUY IT IF ON PC!
2392	1	a	This Is Freaking Awsome 
2633	1	a	its like cod bo3 with dinosaurs.
923	1	a	Excelent game, highly recommended, try the demo.
1052	1	a	Good game if you are into tower defense, fps, bruce campbell and dead orcs.
1450	1	a	16.5/20
2627	1	a	Unknown game blew my mind. Plays like HALO!!!! Kill dinosaurs like TUROK!!!! Vehicles work great, leveling up gets addicting. Within the small hour of gameplay I blew a pack of Compy's with a grenade, a triceratops rammed me and knocked me back across the map, stepped on by a trex, ran over a pack of raptors and got picked up by a damn Pterodactyl.....while I was driving a freaking warthog! Instant buy 4 pack for me and my buds.
6285	1	a	I only bought this because it was 0,16$
4542	1	a	This game is amazing... Screw all the hater... Any game that you can use a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ piss colored lightsaber is obviously a pretty amazing game. This game is so good that you can run into a trex and he doesn't die. The creators of the game should now own call of black ops 5 san andreas fault edition. It makes me want to make love to a dinosaur... In my dreams I picture that dinosaurs are still alive and ready to be made love to. I have completely changed my way of life. I now worship dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs. Dey R mye fyverote tyng. Eye Love them with a passion.. Withoute Dynosurs i would have no luve in my life.. If i could make love to evey dino every I wood.
4257	0	a	I don't know how this game is on steam. Constant crashing, disconnecting, bugs, etc. This isn't a finished product, not even close. Sound design is pretty bad, animations are mediocre, player and weapon models are kinda bad too. Dinosaurs are alright, but the environment is actually shockingly beautiful.  A bundle of bad/boring/broken mechanics, a generic grind game style, and no real reason to be grinding have this game coming in substantially worse than almost any other multiplayer free-to-play game, making it a bad purchase. Only played for about an hour, but most laughter and enjoyment came from just how absurdly bad some aspects of the game were.
5339	0	a	This is my first review ever. It's unfortunate it has to be a negative one. I installed this game when it was still 15$... Played it.... enjoyed it... 1 year later or so i reinstall it (today) and it wont run. Very upsetting seeing as how it is 79 cents now.. Dont feel like i am getting my moneys worth.  
1643	1	a	Riders On The Storm
5077	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
5771	1	a	This game is great and it's only for $1.
394	0	a	I hate this.
1128	1	a	It's like lemmings, except instead of babying them along you kill them in a creative way. Oh it's tower defense too.
6365	1	a	I payed a dollar for it a long time ago and it honestly wasn't worth it.  I gave it a try a few hours ago and it has come a long way, at the very least it's definitely worth the dollar.
2465	0	a	Dinosaurs. What's not to love, right? Right?... In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds.   In my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery.   The game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color.   It isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it. You may have better luck.
2425	0	a	mehh...you get what you pay for for.
3712	0	a	Played the game for about 30 minutes. About 2 minutes in I got stuck in the geometry of the world and survived several waves stuck. And then I fell through the world. I really don't understand why anyone would say this is a good game.
2294	1	a	Insane level  Active the generator, kill raptors, restore the generator, , kill compys, restore the gen again, almost die ; revive, buy weapons upgrades,kill dilos ,secure the outpost killing a trike and 236 dinos, back to base without press 5 and no vehicles, a rex is coming; poor rex, be a sniper; dead by rhams,help mates; dying in front of you,buy all augments , even the antifreeze in slopes, bots stuck in a wall; annoying sound, trike smash; die in high grass, buy smoke ,last dinosaur in wave; rahm stuck in a high rock sooooo far away....  Kill everything using the gatling gun with the assault class... 11/10
5937	1	a	it's a fun game with cool weapons and etc
6256	1	a	I've never had so much fun, particularly for 99 cents. This game is absurdly fun with a friend, especially side by side LAN. I would probably pay as much as $5-$10 for this game, in fact - I know there are a ton of reviews about how laughably broken the game is, but I honestly did not spot too many bugs. I suspect an update or two has cured many of the old issues.  AWESOME GAME.
4303	1	a	ORION: Prelude (formerly ORION: Dino Beatdown and more recently ORION: Dino Horde) is easily one of the most underrated games of the last 5 years. It's been torn apart constantly and consistently by the gaming press and given a right beatdown of its own. Since its release in May 2012 I've put a solid 100 hours into the games and I can say with great confidence that it deserves much more credit than it is given. Spiral Game Studios has come a long way with this title and ORION: Prelude is a fresh, fun, and exciting gaming experience.  If you've ever played Left 4 Dead, Killing Floor, Gears of War Horde Mode, or Halo's Firefight you know what to expect from ORION: Prelude. It's a co-operative FPS where up to 5 players work together to defend or capture objectives by fighting off wave after wave of dinosaurs. To vanquish said dinos there are three classes to choose from at the start of each match; Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault sports a jetpack, Recon a cloaking device, and Support a healing gun. Each kill earns a player cash depending on the damage they contribute which can be spent on upgrades between waves. Those upgrades range from bigger guns and bigger knives to Augmentations like a double jump or stronger melee attacks. There's enough to choose from that you'll be mixing and matching with the different classes to create unique builds each match. This really helps the game stay fresh.  On top of the class customization there are plenty of different modes available to chose from including a VS mode called 'Duel' which is akin to elimination style modes in other games. There's Survival, King of the Hill, Free for All and many others including a mode where you are able to play as the dinosaurs themselves VS other human controlled characters. Controlling the dinosaurs is a bit difficult at first as they are large and stiff feeling, but after a round or two you'll be crushing human face like a true prehistoric behemoth and laughing the whole time.  When it was first released in May of 2012 as ORION: Dino Beatdown it was, admittedly, a mess. The word 'glitchy' comes to mind with a hard lean towards broken and many of the game modes mentioned above weren't available. It was playable, but dinosaurs didn't behave intelligently. They would clip through the stage and animate like caffeine loaded squirrels with rigor mortis, guns wouldn't make noise and would even sometimes disappear altogether. Not to mention the announcer getting stuck repeating lines such as 'threat eliminated!' and 'threat down!' over and over until the match ended. But, for what ORION: Dino Beatdown was at its core, a co-operative horde-mode FPS with dinosaurs, it was amazingly fun.  Yes the game had its moments, to put it lightly, but it wasn't so bad that it deserved the media meltdown that ensued after its release. Spiral was quick to respond to community feedback and within a few short weeks issued a number of patches that corrected graphical errors, class balance issues, optimization problems, all the while preparing large and free content packs that were released the following months. Eventually the game was re-branded and soft re-released twice to what it is known as today: ORION: Prelude.  If you were to compare the two games side by side it would be like night and day. Should Spiral have released Dino Beatdown as it was? No, probably not. But I'm glad they did. After playing the game day in and day out over the past few years my friends and I all realized that playing it together was the most fun we'd had since Super Smash Bros. Melee on our old GameCube. Time and time again we found ourselves laughing to tears and getting chomped. Much like Melee, L4D and Street Fighter did before it; ORION: Prelude has earned itself a spot on the shelf as one of our go-to party games for years to come.
1396	1	a	It may doesn't look like good game, but it's great.
5738	0	a	Installed the game. Launched the Game. Walked out of base. Looked around and said nope.
1861	1	a	and i love this game all ready... BEEP!!!
5653	0	a	Just no... DonÂ´t waste your 1$ ! 
5193	1	a	fockin' bought this game for fockin' 15$ and now it's f2p  fockin' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i tell ya  FOCK Me fockin' british  
2783	1	a	I was rather worried about all the bad reviews, and the awful metascore this game had recieved, but given my interest in games like Killing Floor and Halo, I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, how bad can dinosaur killing be, right?  I downloaded the free trial, and WOW was I in for a surprise. It was just good, clean fun. It didn't feel as tight as Killing Floor, or as 'Next-Gen' as Halo usually does, but the combination of those two, and lack of real seriousness about the game make a fantastically fun time sink, and an extremely enjoyable game.  Within 15 minutes, I decided it was worth the $0.99 to pick this game up, as I had already had more fun playing it than I have had in a game like this since Killing Floor, and I do not regret it one bit, especially at this price.  While there are a few bugs here and there, such as dinos occasionally flying up to unbelievable heights, and arrows hovering after they have fired and hit a target. But there doesn't seem to be much of anything that gets in the way of the actual gameplay.  While to this point, I have not strayed much from the Players vs. Dinosaurs Survival mode (which is truly fantastic when you get a good group of people playing with you), there are many other different gameplay modes that provide good variety. Also, there is a pretty good selection of weapons in this game, catering to many different tastes, and nothing seems to be TOO over powered, with weapons seeming to be rather well balanced. The different 'Augmentations' are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to play to your own strengths instead of always having a vanilla character.  TL;DR:  Overall, this is a really good game, and has changed a lot for the better from the game that recieved a 35 metascore. Definitely worth the $1 it is right now, and probably even the $10 or $15 it is at full price.
3978	1	a	Best game ever played it for DAYS!! Thumbs up god work!!!!!!
3385	1	a	I was hiding on top of a cliff I accessed with my jetpack wielding a rapid firing grenade launcher since everyone knows dinosaurs only hurt when they bite. T-rex proceeds to pick up rock with his mouth, throw it, and instakill me.  10/10 would Michael Bay Jurassic Park again
2071	1	a	Still better than CoD Ghosts
3426	1	a	Why did I buy it. â¥â¥â¥â¥
4759	0	a	For 99p this game is well... it's 99p so it's not a waste of money.  But for anything more then Â£2.99 let alone it's original Â£11.99 price tag.  --Cons -Bad graphics -Terrible game machinics -SUPER repetitive -Simply the fact that it's normal price is Â£11.99 is stupid in all -SUPER loud sounds for no reason -Nothing is explained and nothing seems to works correctly -No good sounds for guns or hit markers sounds -Not satisfying in anyway to actually shoot the dino's -Terrible model detail -Lacks FOV slider from what i could see -Buggy (Terrible dino clipping and pretty unbalanced and random)  -Pro's It really was only 99p on SALE. It had good game option
5400	1	a	for the 1$ i paid(and if you intend to play with friends, even the full price justifies it) i got many hours of fun.  a horde survival-shooter with a large sized map, classes and vehicles tossed in the mix and epic boss fights(well... t-rex counts as a boss, right?)  if you liked killing floor's style of survival, chances are good you'll like this. thats all i can say.
4588	1	a	amazing game would reccomend to 9/10 people if you like cool dinosours then buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is some good â¥â¥â¥â¥ like even dj khaled would play this game if he wasnt always riding his jet ski on the path to success
4653	1	a	THAT IS ONE BIG PILE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2680	1	a	If you love Dinos and hunting this game is for you
1619	1	a	This game is brillant! It's a simple platformer, all you need to do is use 3 keys. Left, right and jump (so space bar or A on a xbox controller). That's it. Simple; yet great! The game is quite challenging, definitely gave me so frustration but the music throughout the entire game is rather calming to an extent. As much as you get frustrated, you never feel like you want to destory the keyboard or controller. You may get very close to thinking that, but the background music just keeps you sane.
3274	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
430	1	a	The only critism is the lack of some sort of multiplayer/Co-op. This game is awesome!!!!!!
328	1	a	Best TPP defence/shooter game, a must-have!
817	1	a	Similar to Dungeon Defenders but not a grindfest, no item drops or multiplayer either, but the gameplay itself is much more fun, interesting, and challenging in the right ways. The traps/upgrades are creative and diverse enough to allow for tons of different ways to conquer each level. The sequel is gonna have co-op.
732	1	a	A fun game of tower defense and FPS
3716	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
1290	1	a	The campaign is fun, but the real beautiful core of this game is in the survival mode, which is one of the most delightful co-op experiences I've ever had. It's tough but fair. Get a co-op partner and â¥â¥â¥â¥ some mooks up
6230	0	a	For a start micro transactions......In a paid game? Badly optomisted, poor quailty and just really crap over all.  10/10 would NOT play again
4710	0	a	i purchased this on my windows pc that meets the recommendated software and stuff but then when i go in the audio is all f'ed up and i get 1.5 frames per second and you said you fixed it if its not fixed in 1 week (a week because i dont think you did bug fixes in a while and i want a refund if its not working) ill get a refund
3624	1	a	very good game defiently worth your money
1953	0	a	This game is a lot more crappy than the trailer suggests. But hey, it's only 0,19 so can't complain but would not buy it again.
1685	1	a	One might think it's a cheap crap. Well. You know. True, it's cheap but... GOOD platformer! Simple but hi-res visuals. It makes your mind work a bit to complete a level. And the sound of colliding asteroids is so sweet! :-)
696	1	a	Does a really good job of combining Tower Defense with third person FPS elements. Difficulty curve goes way up halfway through, but it's worth seeing through to the end. Definately recommend for Tower Defense fans.
2991	1	a	Great game so worth 1 dollar
3323	1	a	Got it cause it was only a dollar and im loving it! has replayability because you never know what might happen. Wouldn't say its worth $15 though. More like a $10 game but its still good and you should buy it while its 93% off! played a few hours and been having a blast with my neighbor!!!
1439	1	a	Just Wow !  10/10 ...If you're a Metal Slug Fan ! what r u waiting for ! go ahead and buy it xD ...
4203	0	a	Did not like it, felt horrible and bulky to play, UI is horrible, idk how there are so many good reviews?! Lack of server hosting, customisations is minute to nothing, would not play again, did not enjoy  3/10
3160	1	a	I drove into a trex and killed it                                10/10
269	1	a	Really fun, I love it :) 8/10
3638	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes..... all the best parts of Halo, L4D, and Borderlands combined into one epic co-op multiplayer survival shooter. Hopelessly addicting, endlessly fun.
6302	1	a	Even tho this game isn't very popular, it's graphics are kinda basic, and the cosmetics are mostly paid, I must say this game is very nice, fun and interesting. It's transformation along the time was insane, and being rubish, turned into a pretty good game. Sincerely 8/10
4137	1	a	the computer that i play on is not very good and the internet is worse so i had to turn down most of the settinng and even then the game lagged so its not ment for my computer but still for the price and the ammout of content its pretty goodd
3000	1	a	Great game the Meta score does not do it justice at all!!!
1211	1	a	Very good and fun 3rd person tower defense game. I love it.
1441	1	a	Another great successor of Klei Interactive (creators of first Shank and Mark of the Ninja). Great visuals, Amazing Soundtrack and Unbelievably enjoyable gameplay. If you are a hack-n-slash fan, pick it! beat-em-up fan? pick it! Like to chainsaw someone's face? Pick it! This game was intended for you! If you have a bloodlust desire, this game can grant your wishes :3 p.s. It's also have a co-op survival mode, worth checking out too
2706	1	a	Every so often you get a game that feels so genuine. By that i mean that this game is low budget as hell, Glitchy and bad quality animations, generic graphics. But through playing the game, i felt that the people who made it really enjoyed making it and they made it mostly for themselves with no expectations of getting popular or even wanting to be popular. I just get that vibe from it and for me it just makes the game so much better.   I have only played the survival mode. and it's kinda like the serious sam games but with different classes and unlockables and dinosaurs. And i love it.
4447	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
3964	1	a	I bought this game for 99 cents. I thought it would completely suck. It turned out to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. Buy a 4 pack and give it to some friends. You won't regret it.
447	1	a	Pretty fun game. It's a tower defense game, but it's also a 3rd person action game. I do not like regular tower defense games, as they are all about setting up a defense and then waiting for the wave to end. In this one, you get to pick various weapons to fight off the enemies, while setting traps and defenses. Definitely give this game a try, and buy it if it goes on sale again!
1181	1	a	Traps, fast thinking, lot of fun, good humor. It's a must have in your library. Get it when it's on special at worst you won't regret it.
5868	0	a	If you have a few hours to waste and $1 to spare, its ok. If it wasn't so cheap I'd say its a waste of time, sell some cards and buy this is you absolutely have to, otherwise don't bother.
848	1	a	Surprisingly fun and captivating, this game will surely keep you entertained for a few hours
3525	1	a	This game makes me think I'm retRded 11/10 but it's still kinda fun
6318	1	a	A fun little game, suprisingly so for the graphics and price tag. Good with friends, but not too much map variety.
2899	1	a	A fun FPS that has basic FPS things (mainly stealing mechanics from Halo) but has it's own superior uniqueness.
3989	1	a	This game costs 79 cents. 79.Cents. It's worth it. If you want a few hours of fun with your friends, buy this. It has dinosaurs, an in-game shop,did i mention dinosaurs? It's fun.
2846	1	a	The Bestest First and Only Dianasour Game! keep the great work Spiral!  9.8/10  EDIT (8/26/2014): Since Orion: Prelude is out Thank god i already bought the Orion Dino: Horde Because i diden't have to Repurchase  Rate again : 10/10
818	1	a	Game of the Year! ;) (Y)
614	1	a	After playing some OMD Unchained I decided to replay the first one and it's still as good as I remember. Sure, the second one has more stuff, a more interesting upgrade system, 2 player co-op and is overall the better game but the first one is still fun.  It has a better feel to kill orcs than Unchained and the progression pacing is more fluid. Maybe not worth the 10 bucks anymore as OMD2 is out for years but owning OMD1 gets you 10 extra levels in OMD2 so alone for this it's worth at least the sale price.
1244	1	a	Very orc
6454	1	a	I picked this game up a while back during one of the free week events for only a few pounds. It was pretty decent but there were still a lot of very noticeable bugs, and I was aware of it's jagged history. I may not have played it much lately but I've been following each update, and I'm extremely impressed. That the developers spent so long supporting and working on a game they admit was a disaster and managing to turn it into something that could rival some of the more popular titles on Steam is nothing short of applause worthy. And the price drop, holy  hell . This is one of, if not the cheapest games on here. BUY THIS.
1760	1	a	I have been playing this game for a little while now and I would have to say it's worth purchasing. If you are into platforming games I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this.   Especially with the current sale going on it's definitely a good game to add to your library.  I did a short First Impressions video on it showing the first 10 minutes or so of the game if you're intersted.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEjDax3XFs     Social Media Twitter -  https://twitter.com/kovicplayz  Youtube -  https://www.youtube.com/kovicplayz  Twitch -  https://www.twitch.tv/kovicplayz/profile 
6291	0	a	Steam says that I've got 2 hours on this crap. I can't refund it.
6102	1	a	It's a pretty broken game but it's fun to play with with friends
5472	0	a	GIVE ME MY FREINDS MONEY BACK!! He sucks at the game.
5692	0	a	granted, this is a fun game but look at this  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   don't support them
5847	1	a	This game is great. it like a cheaper call of duty, it was many of the same features and its easy to set up a server with friends
2006	1	a	What an awesome game, very fun, definately worth my 19 cents i got from steam trading cards. I'm going to play some more now.
3616	1	a	This game...is just...Dinotastic, although it could get a bit repittive after a few rounds and I've expirecned some wall glitches I think if you like murdering things without 0 guilt, Orion is for you, I'm always willing to play, just send me a PM... Treyarch just got a run for there money. R.I.P. COD 7/10  -PROS- -Graphics are legit. -Gameplay is quite fun -VEHICLES+A FRICKEN MECH. -Weapons aare cool. -Rewards are rewarding.  -CONS-  -Involes real life money for extrap maps. -A bit glitchy -3 Classes gets a bit boring -No customization unless you spend real money -Playing it alone could be life dangering.
5107	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game
3449	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game i bought it and now i cant play it â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!
4933	0	a	This game has good gameplay, but the idea of having to WAIT in order to respond, is simply ANNOYING; I'd rather be the dinosaurs and hunt the soldiers, instead!  But no; the GAME DOESN'T LET YOU CHOOSE TO BE ONE! Not in Survival mode, at least. This game is a decent deal for 3 bucks, because it currenty acts like cheap overrated shovelware. So, for effort, the designs and music are great, but waiting for SEVERAL MINUTES makes the only fun of waiting, being a 'troll' by making cheesy puns and jokes. If the game doesn't allow you to do that, then I'd be having much more fun, by playing Xbox 360 'kinect' games; as long as the controls work okay, and the gameplay is ACTUALLY FUN!  My advice? You can probably find better USED games for less, from certain 'bargain' stores; heck, I even found a copy of Freedom Force, (which still has the code, on the back of the CD case) for only 1 dollar! Heck, if I can't find a patch to make it work on Windows 8, I'd probably have to buy it on Steam, so it WILL MORE LIKELY WORK!
4161	1	a	I liked the mechanics, the waves, the round stores and all that jazz that came along with this game. I'd have to say that it was worth a dollar. Although 'Guardians of Orion' has left a dark mark on my the developer's history. I still appreciate the small price and content of this game.
234	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
4979	1	a	Dinosaurs to sxc for me
4811	1	a	Guns and dinosaurs? Much wow, such bite, much pain, so hospital, much swag, much death.
5387	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
3179	1	a	wow..lots and lots of dinos especially on prehistoric difficulty...lots of fun and only 79p..AWESOME
551	1	a	Finally, a high budget TD! And it kicks a$$!
6035	1	a	It's a cute game. Who doesn't like to kill dinosaurs?
2355	1	a	Soooooooooo This game finished downloading; so I decided to sit down and play it at (around) 12:15 AM Eastern time. When I look around or just stand still the screen tears and graphical errors seem to occur. Combine this sleeping and tired eyes and you can either   A. Get yourself a headache B. Go Blind C. Get an EXTREME seziure  Or the common effect D. All of the above!  4.5/5
1956	1	a	BEEP is a game of puzzles and a mix of shooter combat, but also adds a cute art.
3806	0	a	this game is crap the quality sucks and the price is a rip off
400	0	a	really fun game but i cant get past the first wave becouse  1: MY COMPUTER CANT LOAD THE PLAYED MODEL SO IM A FLOATING CROSS BOW 2: MY GAME CRASHES (sometimes even my computer) WHEN I CALL THE FIST WAVE 
3096	1	a	Summary: This game is WELL worth the $0.99 it is selling for now. Gameplay is enjoyable, and the the overall graphics top it off.  8/10 Would knife a t-rex mid air again.  I bought this game for $0.99 when it went on sale as a game sold regularly at $12.99. This game by far was not worth $12.99. I didn't even consider it worth $4.99. The gameplay is nice, but very repetitive. Playing with friends is by far the most enjoyable way to play, but to fully play a match through, you have to play for a few hours non-stop. Point shoot point shoot point shoot.   The graphics make up for how little thinking is involved at times, and I'm not saying that you don't have to think strategy sometimes, just not most times. Out numbered yes, using your cloak to get past groups or larger dinosaurs is very enjoyable, but sitting at base sitting and spawn killing dinosaurs with a minigun, it gets boring.  Another problem with the game is how the pvp matches seem out of place. Not only do some of the maps have cartoon-like graphics, but the pvp system is so screwed up that it isn't enjoyable to play on those servers. All you see in those servers is people spam clicking with their sword until the other person dies or they die.  Overall the game I could have seen going for $2.99 and being well worth the money. Now that it is set at $1.00, I see it maybe getting more of a playerbase.
4890	1	a	Cool game but I'm preety sure you need high graphic PC to play this game but it's really fun had fun shooting Dnosaurs and teaming up with people to kill and last a long time against fighting dinosaurs.
4712	1	a	Much lag, is a hard game for the lag
4477	0	a	I have literally never played a worse game.
1256	1	a	Great mix of action and tower defense! Music is awesome and it's just plain hilarious!
1516	0	a	This game is bad. The AI is bad. The level design is bad. The gameplay is bad. The story is nonexistant. Another poorly developed EA title.
940	1	a	A combination of tower defense and 3rd person action/shooting. This light hearted title asks you to not only strategize your defensive layouts but to also throw yourself into the thick of the combat in order to kill thousands upon thousands of bloodthirsty Orcs.
1576	0	a	This game is alright if you have a little time to waste, but I can't recommend it.  Pros:   it's cheap    it's good enough for a standard Tower Defense Game   Cons:   Graphics are Meh   The 2 campaigns are pretty much the same   Very limited amount of different towers   enemies are kind of uninspired. theres kind of only 2 variations,    one that is untargetable for a short duration, and one that can fly   , otherwise its pretty much just the bigger they are, the more hits they can take.   If you like TD games, this one is alright, but if you are looking for a really good one that actually offers some creativity, this isn't it.
6151	1	a	Jetpack onto a rock and shoot dinos for the first 3 waves. Get a tank on wave 4. Win. 10/10 
4616	0	a	Horrible, I feel ripped off for 99 cents right now. Bad game.
199	1	a	Awesome game!Unique gameplay and defense tactics, very nice upgrades. Lots of humor and you get to kill LOTS OF ORCS! :D I recommend this game, it's playable by all ages, no matter whether you are 12, 20, 40, 70... :D You will like it! It's lots of fun. I would give it a 10/10! :)
5037	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is always a damned dollar. just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it. It's really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but it's fun to play with friends. Or give the dollar to a homeless man. Whatever
4107	1	a	Imba gameplay and gFx  A must for all Jurrasic Park Lover's &lt;3  Unlimted fun !!!!!  Just go for it
5634	0	a	give me my Â¢.49 back
1019	1	a	Fast paced, arcade-y yet surprisingly deep tactical game play. This is 1 to keep.
1918	0	a	It's really bad
1034	1	a	Solid twist on the Tower Defense Genre. Good introduction to the series if you get the whole franchise pack. Personally, I prefer the second game because there is significantly more flexibility in your game experience, more weapons, more traps, more levels, and more longevity, but the game is still money well spent. Like killing things with traps and weapons? Check. Like good solid humor? Check Interesting and motivating game soundtrack? Check Like a game that requires strategy and thinking? Check Like mass chaos that puts constant pressure on you? Check Like a overall solid game design concept? Double Check (You will get the partial joke here, if you have ever finished the sequel). Just get the game and play it, and you will understand in less than 5 minutes. Lightning in a bottle.
5809	0	a	Can't say I really enjoyed my time with it.
221	1	a	For eveyone who likes WC3 TD, this game is a must have! Awesome settings and you can now run around with your own charachter. I had a lot of fun! Tip: if you notice you did the wrong placement of traps within the first few rounds, just recreate the game and try a difference tactic.
5901	1	a	')
4132	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
3826	0	a	t-rex stuck in a small tree... kinda say it all. it sucks
1071	1	a	Awesome defense plus action game, and amazing soundtrack.
3393	1	a	Now when I bought this game I thought it would just be a cheap dinosaur game, but I was wrong. This game is amazing, I recommend it to everybody who loves Halo because it kind of has that halo futeristic style feeling. Good Job guys at spiral!  Pros: 1. So many achievements (I'm an achievement junkie) 2. Gamemodes are great 3. Fun single player and multiplayer experience 4. Great gameplay 5. Great controls  And why did Metacritic hate this game so much?
6154	1	a	Played as a dinosaur. Ate a guy. 10/10 would eat someone again.
3861	1	a	this is only my third day of playing and already my hair is starting to grow back and I find myself constantly surrounded by chicks in bikinis. 9/10
3622	1	a	The game cost $1 during the Steam Summer Sale and was the best $1 I spent. My brother and I had no clue what the game was about or how it worked. We jumped into a survival game and instantly enjoyed it. I expect that there will be many more hours spent on this game in the future.
286	1	a	Gives perfectionists high blood pressure.
6127	1	a	Great game, don't trust Metacritic's broken system
6323	1	a	Really good game for the Price.  I reccomend if you want a few hours to spare with your friends, fun, cheap, and Dinosaurs
3916	1	a	0/10 it ruined my life. Okay, without joking, this game is too fantastic to cost only a dollar (however I should not complain here, I can save up more money), great dynamics, epic slow motion, the only things I don't like: the music is a bit boring for me and the other thing what disturbs me even more is that I can run through the dinosaurs (so, a not neat texture bug) but if this bug will be fixed, and more music will be added, this will be a perrrrfect game in my oppinion. I can only suggest it to anyone, especially now that it is super cheap during this sale.
6352	0	a	A new twist to the Zombie survival genre. With tons of farming tools you can slaughter zombies for days! To catch these dinosaurs you have to have things that are called 'PokÃ©balls'. After you have a full party of 10 members you can start platforming on some HARD levels. I have yet to meet a game that has flying bears that fall from space to mars. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Dance Dance Revolution.
5453	0	a	makes you buy 5 dollars in funds to get a dollar game wtf?
993	1	a	Awesome, fun, simple yet strategic. Fast action. Great game!
1023	1	a	If you are looking for a Insanely fun and bloody TD/TPS,If you like killing orcs,Then this is the game for you! Orcs must die! 1 has many unique traps,weapons,trinkets and spells which you can experiment or play with,I recommend that you play this before you play the sequel because it has a story to it,If you don't like singleplayer tower defense/third person shooters then go over to the sequel if you like :P I want you to grab you're money and buy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the game because it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worth it and i like you to play the game for yourself because i don't want to spoil all the stuff it has :P
2698	1	a	t-rex sited on me 10/10-woud be afk agien
1397	1	a	One of the best games I've played the past couple of years. A bit short, but nice replay value on other difficulties.
3326	1	a	Awesome for the .50 cents price tag alone!
1182	1	a	Just some pure, unadulterated fun. One of those games where you say you'll do one level then it turns out to be three hours later. It's tons of fun and the fact that you unlock a new trap or ability after every level just makes it that much better. Only gripe might be that I can't seem to be able to control my computer's volume while in game. But it is still loads of fun.
2179	1	a	This game reminds me of of the time I got that dinosaur skull from an auction.
895	1	a	Decent Game. The second one is better in my opinion.
2335	1	a	The Metascore given by critics to this game is very misleading as this game deserves somewhere between 80-90 score. Good gameplay - almost the same if you combine Halo and Jurassic Park together. Makes you nervous everytime you queue solo for the game. Best to play it in multiplayer. Slight bugs on the dinosaurs but its a great game to have.
3928	1	a	at 0.99c its worth it, you and your friends will have fun, my only problem is there isnt enough lobbies
4321	1	a	Get It While Its Free 
5471	0	a	If this game was a cheeseburger it would be a rotten cheeseburger.
1296	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! Mark of the Ninja without stealth, this Commando-esque game is worth every penny. Very fun and challenging at times, just like Mark of the Ninja is. The creators have really shown their talent with this game. Get this game!!
1566	1	a	This is my first game I ever got on Steam and I made a good choice. If you like 'Tower defense' type of games, I can really recommend it to you!
675	1	a	Totally addictive, very easy to start, but after a while it starts to test your skills. It's a very fun game to play, really worth the price  100 out of 100 of course ;)
2623	1	a	Great little game, fun too mess around on and fun to play with friends. I would recommand getting it. :D
936	1	a	Highly addicting game that feels part RPG, part tower defense. Fully recommended!
2802	1	a	Very fun, it has some server problems but it is evolving.
2157	0	a	Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the 'Play Solo' option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.  It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.
2406	0	a	They say the Meta score is wrong I think their right I agree with them the metascore is wrong.  It should be lower
5662	1	a	One of the Funniest COOP Games EVER!!!!! Recommended 10/10 (Play with Friends only)
2034	1	a	I can`t rage on this game. The characters are really cute and the levels are interesting as well.
5415	1	a	I remember when I bought for a $1 i now have crippling depression.
436	1	a	This is probably my favorite iteration of tower defense, save for the sequel, because it takes what's too often a genre where it's an impersonal enemy grinder and forces you to be an active participant at all times. Combining traps is crazy fun when you get it right, and the game itself is irreverent in just the right doses to not be too winky or tiresome. Very solid, though the main campaign is almost a bit too long and difficult, and this game is hampered a little bit by the fact that the sequel surpasses it in a lot of ways, so if you're not looking to dive in too deep, just grab the sequel.
3526	1	a	Emotionally charged, rampant with memorable imagery. Orion: Dino Horde is a philosophical adventure that only one with a liberal amount of experimental sexuality will properly enjoy. The rush of adrenaline is unparallelled to any carny ride or action film in current existence. Fun with friends and loved ones, not really recommended for young children or pregnant women.  In short: more fun than it has any right to be
4781	0	a	Boring Buggy Mess
4763	0	a	i got this confused with primal carnage... this is not primal carnage.
3536	1	a	Haven't played it, but it sure looks gewd
4395	1	a	its ok
2152	1	a	shot a midget pterodactyl with a helicopter shooting rockets, then i randomly blew up: 11/10 would die again 
6080	1	a	A fun game. The only thing I really dislike about it is the absurd recoil
115	1	a	
423	1	a	The orcs must die, painfuly and at my pleasure.
3443	1	a	great game.
30	0	a	Though i was addicted to it and played maybe 2,5 times to collect all the achievements, can't really recommend it, unless for a big discount. Gameplay is repetitive and becomes stale quickly (collect pocker hands to create attacks). Additional magic spell add a bit flavor. Also the story was interesting. Oh, and the epic music playing all the time becomes annoying after a few minutes :)
2103	1	a	 ORION: Prelude  is worth a look. It sells for 0,79â¬. Iâd say the price is right. Iâd also say the price point is probably another move by the developer to try and earn back some brownie points. Itâs a fun little time waster and I can see it being a good game to play with friends over a few drinks. Glitching through a building you have just climbed on to might be funny then.
2658	1	a	i need a tutorial on how to stop playing this game because damn gurl, this game is gud
4843	0	a	Wait times are too long to get into the fun. You join a game, have to watch other people play for 5+ minutes before any fun starts.
4727	1	a	Cool
500	1	a	Fantastic blend of action and Tower Defense. Best one I've seem in this genre yet. Can last very long if the player is at least a little bit perfectionist. Also, this game gets bonus points from me for not taking itself too seriously. It even comes packed with cheesy hurmor and a lovable goofy protagonist.
4740	1	a	Some people hate this game others love it, if you are unable to play it is most likely your computer and/or your intenet connection.
6111	0	a	One of the worst games on steam. Unplayable. If I could remove it from my game library permanently I would.
2588	1	a	Step 1: Happily play with friend for 20 minutes Step 2: 420.69 mph in a speedy gonzalez car.  Step 3: Get stuck in rock Step 4: 5 mins later figure out suicide command Step 5: Continue to play happily  10/10 ign would buy again.
3049	1	a	It's buggy - but for $0.99? Why not? The survival gamemode is definitely worth at least that. I have fun with it.
4289	1	a	For $.99, you can kill dinosaurs with 4 friends or play PvP with 9 friends! Best decision in years!
3490	1	a	It has potential.  First Game - My ping was way too high, I couldn't communicate with my teammate, nor hit a computer controlled dinosaur. (I disconnected) Second Game - I hosted it myself, FPS was SO bad, said game in question isn't even close to being optimized for any gaming computer known to man. I lower all my settings which did nothing, so I decided I need to restart the game for this to take effect. (I disconnected) Third Game - I join another matchmaking game in progress, my FPS is fine with the graphics settings all at plebian tier levels, ping is fine, I have no clue what I am doing, the game is telling me to go from this point to that point. YELLING out commands. Host has left the server. (I am forced to disconnect) (I exit the game in disgust) 
2265	1	a	This game is T-Rexcellent.
4498	0	a	This Game is Horrible
3354	0	a	Back when this game was known as Dino Horde and cost $20 it was actually worth it however with the update to erase their metascore AGAIN they almost reverted back the wonderful interface they had from DH into the garbage beta interface that it is now, the gameplay is the same. Everything is pretty much the same except for the armors which now look even more horrible than how bad â¥â¥â¥ they looked before. Its a good thing its only a dollar, because thats about how much its worth as of now.
6247	1	a	fun game, to toss around.
2906	1	a	This game is awesome... best FPS I've seen in a while.
3807	1	a	This game was a mixture of L4D2, halo and borderlands2. Very fun game 10/10.
2028	0	a	For me, it's not worked ... control is horrible
1321	1	a	Single-player is a blast. Beat it on Normal, and then beat it on Hard. THEN, beat the survival mode by yourself. Oh how I love this game. I AM a glutton for punishment, however.
3650	1	a	Great game. Killed a TRex with a â¥â¥â¥â¥in lightsaber. Then got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by a Robot Santa that drops bombs disguised as Christmas presents. 7/10

3853	1	a	When someone dies everything goes slow mo and it sounds like the inception sound effect  wabawaba/10
3671	1	a	Join game.  guy asks me, 'Are you having fun?'  'No.'  'well then have a nice life f*** boy!'  gets kicked.  10/10, would get kicked again.  
1740	1	a	THe price of this game and the fun it gives is a steal. Totally worth getting. :)
401	0	a	This looked like it might be a good game. Bought it, and spent an hour in the menu trying to get it to work. Mouse won't show up no matter what I did. Tried every forum and fix I could find.  To bad. :/ 
2216	1	a	If you're going to buy a game in which you wield lightsabers, shoot your friends and blow the tar out of some massive dinosaurs while flying hundreds of feet up in the air, I would probably recommend this game above other games that fall into those categories. Most likely.
4329	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ Game.. never before i played such a broken and poorly devloped Game, stay away from it.. only Revelations 2012 is probably worser then this,yeah i know hard to believe, but thrust me lol
892	1	a	Orcs, Must, DIE! that is a fact of life, challenging game, tower defense style that can frustrate you for hours.
809	1	a	MORE SPIKE TRAPS!
4045	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
340	1	a	Meh. Good for a while.
4317	1	a	Game of the year
6171	1	a	This game is extreemely fun. At the time of its writing it is 99 cents which I have no idea why. It is worth way more than that. Just buy it.
1965	1	a	Looks stupid, but it's epic!
4476	1	a	sWAG
973	1	a	For me, more outright fun than Sanctum or Dungeon Defenders. Dungeon Defenders suffers from a Sisyphean feeling of level and item grinding common to MMO's, and Sanctum feels too prescriptive in what approach you need to take to win like more traditional tower defense games. Orcs Must Die avoids this rewarding you with a new toy on each level, and only requiring grinding to beat highscores. Gaining access to new combinations, and highscore tracking, keeps replaying earlier levels interesting.
4155	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
3475	0	a	It's ORION: Dino Horde.
3755	0	a	If you like hearing really loud beeping coming from your PC, piecingly loud, and enough to upset the whole family with no way of turning it off, your going to love this game.
652	1	a	Orcs Must Die!   That's a pretty dumb name.   Although I ended spending way too much time on this silly little game. Orcs Must Die would fall in the 'Tower Defense' Genre but it has so many different twists. Firstly being, there's a pretty funny story and hilarious characters. You not only make traps, you also run around with a sword or gun or frost magic and fight as well. It's entirely possible to win the game without a single trap. It's also entirely possible to win without a single sword swing but both would be incredible difficult. I loved wasting time on this game.
1922	0	a	this game is wank
3123	1	a	It may not be a triple a title with insane graphics and intense story(it doesnt even have a story) but for pp cens, it is hands down the best game ever
2708	1	a	The Best Cheap Game Ever! i wonder why its cheap because the graphic looks fantastic!  10/10
283	1	a	Tower defense and first person action blend incredibly well in this masterpiece. Aside from a hilarious cartoonish humor, the challenges are diffcult enough to keep you playing for dozens of hours. The music score is fantastic and the graphics are colorful. I suggest this game to anybody who enjoys tower defense games!
3334	1	a	The metacritic score is misleading. Orion: Dino Horde is a wonderful game. Its like halo: combat evolved with dinosaurs and hats. If you buy the game now, it will update into the new game by Spiral that is coming out near the end of the year. And make sure to check out the kickstarter for The Orion Project  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project 
835	1	a	Best orc-slaying experience youÂ´ll get, besides the second part of course. Building traps and getting the best rating on the highest difficulty in every level got me quite some time but damn, worth it, so much fun!

359	1	a	Best tower defense / hack and slash i have ever played. Worth it's price and more.
417	1	a	Very fun and challenging. A great choice if you enjoy strategy and tower defense.
1458	1	a	Fast pace, 2 dimensions game. And good story line.
5175	0	a	...Wow, that was pretty bad.  This is what took place In the ten minutes I could handle playing.  I was placed in the tropics with no back story. After a couple of minutes to prepare, a horde of Luddite Velociraptors started â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the generator 100 meters from camp (I think it's a camp). Once you kill them, another swarm of dinos appear with the same vendetta. That's it...if that sounds like a good time, give it a try. It's free for a week.
1687	1	a	BEEP is very well balanced and just plain fun to play. You know these games where you feel the dedication of the developers? BEEP is just that! Instead of playing clones and remakes of old 2D platformers why not play a modern game that brings new things to the table? Well, i wouldn't say BEEP is very innovative with it's features but it feels polished from the beginning and will surprise you here and there. For some reason, it's easy to fall in love with this game.  'BEEP' is a simple but interesting game with some cute graphics and good physics and awesome music. Nice example of how to create an indie game without being pretentious. Nothing less, nothing more.
4312	1	a	Steam Free-2-Play âORION: Dino Hordeâ event / 75% off sale
1881	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
3888	0	a	Update 29/06/16: My original review was for Orion: Dino Beatdown, which then became Dino Horde and now Prelude. Despite the game going through several name changes to put itself back on the steam frontpage for more sales and to reset it's bad review scores it's still an unenjoyable mess of a game with a developer surrounded by controversy of stolen assets and crowdfunding fraud. Read here for more info and sources:  http://www.thejimquisition.com/trek-versus-activision-how-orion-went-from-victim-to-villain-in-one-night/  Just because it's cheap does not forgive the fact it's a bad game and run by asset thieves, the shady dealings of the developer are well known and should never be supported even if the sale price was $0.01. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPERS GAMES FOR ANY PRICE.
5147	0	a	Once upon a time I gave this game some praise and said it was janky but fun! Unfortunately, then all the content dried up, a microtransaction shop was added (along with the maps cut in the last pre-Horde patch), and the game effectively turned into a just-fixed-enough-to-be-dull game instead of a hilarious drinking game.  If you buy this, only buy this with friends who know what they're getting into, and who will certainly play with you. Also have fun waiting for a sale, because the devs have sat out the past two major Steam sales for... â¥â¥â¥â¥ knows why.
2290	1	a	Great Game For MultiPlayer And Killing Different Dragons !!! &lt;3 &lt;3 but shuld inprove a bit cause it's a bit of a mix of Halo i hate Halo but when i m playing it i kida foget about it :)
2414	1	a	great game hope for new updates
2011	1	a	It's hard to find good games that are 19 cents.
5827	1	a	if you have any comment to add / correct me, please post it   I played on 'normal' to start, and it was a bad idea. i died fast, even if i had money, but i had no idea what to do with them. i STRONGLY suggest you play the first ~ 4-8 levels on newb. that way you have a decent chance to learn and still get a feel of the game.  most of the waves are 'survive'. with 60 seconds pause in wich to check the store to see what you could buy. unfortunately, the 'store' is 2 stores, sometimes so far apart, you HAVE to choose wich one to visit, because you will have NO chance of visiting both. after those 60 seconds, the store literally teleports you out and closes the doors  there are dinos that don't belong to waves, so don't be surprised to see one, and don't waste your time.  once you buy a weapon, you discard the weapon you previously had. except if you buy the augment that allows you to have 2 of that weapon, in wich case you discard the oldest of the 2 weapons that you have  each game you start with a pistol (unless you get something better from lvl up), and you have to buy everything  i strongly suggest you buy the following (your choice in wich order): weapon store: -better pistol. the only gun with unlimitted ammo, so even if it's low rate of fire, don't underestimate it. with higher levels you will get a better starting pistol -main weapon. i saw only 2 tipes: auto and sniper. get one, has much higher rate of fire than a pistol -secondary weapon: shotguns. i am not a fan of up close and personal, so i have no suggestion here, if this is a usefull item -double damage, higher ROF, faster reload, double capacity clip. each costs 5k -adrenaline weapon. see bugs -the longbow adrenaline weapon has many types of tips that can be changed with the reload button: armor piercing (infinite ammo), explosive (sticks to the enemy if is direct hit) explodes after ~ 2 seconds, smoke (the enemy can't see through it), and EMP (weird enough, works backwards: REPAIRS machines and generator and stuns enemies). all arrows that are not AP have 2 max capacity but replenish ~ 1 each 5-10 seconds -turret. the bloody thing lasts 60 seconds, but it shoots most of the little dinos right away. has cooldown until you can set up the next of 120 seconds. so.... don't set one up at the end of a wave, because the pause is 60 seconds. costs 20k. see bugs note: you can have just one of the following: machinegun / flamethrower / rocket turret, cryo knife, repair gun (works on vehicles and generator), instant revival gun -extra life and ammo. used automaticly. cost 500 each. basicly you can't restock the ammo otherwise, so the ammo one might be a choice you have to make most waves  augmentation store: -volverine: HP regen. 'nuff said -double armor. i don't know if that is 'armor' (as the game states) or 'shield' (because it regenerates if you leave it a while) -25% more accuracy -more energy. VERY usefull for use of the special each class has -ability to have 2 pistols / secondary weapon / primary weapon / adrenaline weapon. i think each one costs 5k. see bugs -50% more ca$$$h drop. 'nuff said  there are other choices, it's up to you if you want to bother to get more  bugs (or as microsoft would call them, 'features'): -when you buy a weapon (by mistake, for example) the previous weapon is LOST. you have to pay AGAIN for it.  -when you buy an adrenaline weapon, you lose the primary weapon. i found that it does not happen if you already bought the augmentations to have 2 primary and 2 adrenaline. edit: it still happends, even if i buy all augments. no idea why. the weapons are not lost, just dropped INSIDE the weapon shop = useless edit 2: apparently i buy augmentation for a second primary weapon and a second adrenaline weapon and i can use just 1 primary and 3 adrenaline.  -when you set up the turret, for those 60 seconds the adrenaline weapons and the sniper rifle is no longer available with the scroll of the mouse. maybe it is available with the keyboard, did not have time to check. -don't touch the generator with a vehicle. instant loss of the vehicle :( -grenades and teleporter NOT available with the scroll of the mouse -some augmentations can be bought twice. or at least payed for twice. so look carefully what is bought and what is not. -visor does not freeze augmentation does NOT work. worst 7500 i ever spent  the 'hover' augmentation is... very limitted in use. buy it if you are bored to death and have money to throw away  when a player is 'dead' (1 HP) a team player can revive him or he can revive himself if he kills an enemy (so the smaller ones are very usefull because they die fast). unfortunately in that condition the player can move very slowly and use only the pistol (or heal gun, if the class is medic)
5084	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.

1404	1	a	It's fun with very good graphics. Funny violence, marvelous scenes. But it's too short, I could do it in 4 hours in normal mode :(

1624	0	a	Fun... for about 5 minutes
1407	1	a	Hell yes. Works great with gamepad, fun campaign, and great graphics.
6445	1	a	If you can run over raptors, you can guarentee it will be a perfect game. You can run over raptors in Orion: Prelude.
96	1	a	Imagine Puzzle Quest, except with Poker instead of Match 3. It's a quirky card game with RPG elements. Story is sufficient and doesn't get in the way. Gameplay seems to be balanced so it's not too hard, but not too easy either. The game does seem to go just a bit longer than needed. But it was an enjoyable game considering how different it was.
662	1	a	I know it's not a new game, but like way to many games these days, the inability to customize you input settings really limit the playability...  Fortunately I got this as a part of a humble bundle or I would have been rather upset with it... At the very least include a way to set inverse mouse in the menu..
277	1	a	gut busters
4454	0	a	No thanks.
1360	1	a	Entertaining
4251	1	a	  Got 5 hours out of a $0.49 gift. Worth.  Actually pretty fun with friends, not sure about this whole copyright issue though.
5872	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥! Buy it and derp with friends!
5716	1	a	The game gives me a random achievement every 10 minutes.       11/10
2486	1	a	Best transformation of a game I've ever seen. It was, honestly, very buggy and broken when it was first released. Since then there was a massive overhaul and more (content) updates than any AAA game ever had. The devs didn't charge any money for any new content they released while the in-game content increased by extreme amounts. It is a really enjoyable and good game now and will get another big update (for free of course).  http://spiralgamestudios.com/post/77018495383/a-prelude-within-coming-2014  It's definitely worth the money and because of the current sale you can even get it for only 1â¬
6085	1	a	This is an awesome game. Need to fix some of the small glitches though from where dinosaurs can move to / can move from. But apart from that, its all good!
266	1	a	Simple but very enjoyable. The main character is grand enough.
3941	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
3554	1	a	Its amazing and awsome but pleas fix the lag and also add a allasaures. 
6078	1	a	Aside from the basic graphics, pretty bad characters, dialouge and design... I had fun. I love 'horde' type games, and slaughtering Dinosaurs is a rare treat... In the end, it's not a very good game, but it's fun, and usually $1 on sale. Pick it up on one of those 90% off, or cheaper, but other than that, paaaass.
1984	1	a	This is an extremely fun game and its 20 cents right now. I would pay twenty cents for the level select area where you fly around the space ship. For 5$ this is still a great game. Its really fun.
589	1	a	Grandslam Homerun for me. Tower Defense concept, humor, graphics, music, and sound are all top notch. I buy and try a lot of games -- this and Defense Grid 2 are far and away the best. Not even close. Other games are just dull right now.
1631	1	a	Why so difficult?
4519	0	a	Very confusing for someone who rarely games, and even my brother who games a lot said it was very confusing. In at least the demo there were absolutely no instructions at all on how to play/what the controls are. I had to search a bit online for some help, even then I didn't figure out all the controls(I just started pressing random buttons to see what happened). Glad I didn't buy this game to be honest.
768	1	a	10/10 would kill orc again
3920	1	a	A game so bad that it's so good.
5215	0	a	not really dinosaurs
4159	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was only 49 cents!
4625	1	a	this game needs a steam workshop for mods. NEEDS.
4469	1	a	Please nominate this for game of the year 2017, This is seriously one of the best most innovative games on the market. It is wuite a shame that people are missing out on this gem, if you have $1 and a friend who doesnt have this game, buy them this game and they will love you forever. Basically this is the best game ever made and will easily win Game of the Year if nominated.
2017	1	a	If you are under 11 years, then I recommend
6073	1	a	Good for the first 3 hours, gets old though, repetitive gameplay. Just my opinion
5285	0	a	frame rate are too low..
4189	0	a	It's like Left 4 Dead but with slightly more advanced weapons and Dinosaurs. Oh and vehicles. Oh and there's no map that you progress through, in Orion it's more of just defending a generator (which for whatever reason these Dinosaurs have a vendetta against) and occasionally running away to capture some point that has no relevance to anything. You also get an in game currency for killing the dinosaurs which you spend on other weapons, which are quite expensive. There's a microtransaction shop as well in the game which is a huge turn off even if it is a very cheep game. Third person animations are ridiculously stiff. Also what's with this misleading 'Work together to survive the devastating Dinosaur horde in huge, endless environments.' on your store page? Is it huge or is it endless? It's neither. How can you legally just throw words like that around when it's completely untrue? 3/10, Dinosaur poop.
1101	1	a	This game is so much fun!!! I highly recommend for some Orc pwnage!
4371	0	a	Look at the pretty screenshots.... This game blows.
1621	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is an entertaining platformer, which has an atmosphere that is similar to LittleBigPlanet. It is wholely enjoyable, but lacks multiplayer or stat rankings. 100%able in about 4.5 hours. If you have 5 dollars and 4 hours to kill out of sheer boredom, you might just have some fun.
4768	1	a	looks pretty in 4k and runs well too.
6240	0	a	It used to be called Orion: Dino Horde, but they re released it as an update not a new game and also the game sucks. (although it may be better than CoD ghosts but that isnt difficult to be better than ghosts
1599	1	a	An OK little tower defense type game.
2843	1	a	Firtst off all Outstanding... Met score WTF this game is amazing why would anyone not want this game.. if you think about getting it.... wait why the F*** are you THINKING about getting this game. If your PC can run it get it! :) Here is a list of postitive things. 1) So Addicting  2) Great Game to play with family and friends 3) Great Open World DINO MURDER HELL YEAA!  Here are some negitives 1)Sometimes when you kill a big dino such as a spinosaurus it may crash, this has only happend to my twice and has only happened because my pc is a load of A hole. 2)Animations could be improved (But who cares right?) 3) In game Purchases, such as spiral points that I wish you could earn by leveling up. WHYYY.  Thats it! I rate it... 8/10 (Still some flaws; such as animations and in game purchases.) Addictive rating: REALLY GOD DAMN HIGH!  I love this game hope you do too :) Bye!

4049	0	a	- create a public room - a friend join - start game - wait for the 1st wave to start - wave start attacking - shoot at dinosaurs - client crash (2/2)  E5, NVIDIA 1060 6G,  This issue needs fixing before I can re-try this title and write more of my experience. Currently not recommend.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  I wanted to give this game another try, so I launched it on another PC with different hardware specification. This time it worked. So the above issue is only about hardware compatibility. However, now I encountered another issue:  - create a solo survival mode room and start gameplay - fight and capture the side objective point - mount a battle vehicle and continue to fight - a Triceratops appear - drive the car toward the dino and hit it - car get tossed over  Found: the view angle auto-switch to 1st person. I'm still inside the car. whatever button I press, like 'w' to move forward, the game mysteriously paused. the only way to walk around is by pressing Space button. But once press other buttons again, the game will enter pause state again. A dead cycle. Have to reboot the client. So appart from the gameplay itself, I still can't recommend this title on current stage.
3859	0	a	Put this game in the trash.
918	1	a	It's the kind of power fantasy your insecure â¥â¥â¥ could really use to help you get through the day! Buy it and feel like a man, manly woman, more manly mandroid, or other-gendered being with a sudden infusion of manity.
6346	1	a	Buy one copy......BUT 10 COPIES AND GIVE THEM TO PEOPLE!!!!  This the best game you can spend $0.99 on and honestly I'd spend $10+ on it if it came to it!!! It's worth every cent, it's a ton of fun, and I'd definitively recommend it to everyone!
2541	1	a	this might just be the funnest game i have EVER played. im talking better than cod advanced warfare
2427	1	a	What isn't there to say about this gem of a game?  The developers took a common staple multiplayer game, L4D2, and challenged the concepts that make that game great. 'Why are their zombies? The story just doesn't make sense!' They exclaimed, and went to work fixing all they could.  The end result? An amazing amalgamation of Amazing graphics backed by an abnormally high framerate, incredible gamemodes and features that make it a complete blast to play, and amazingly polished combat. Don't even get me started on the incredible menu design and feedback.  If you're going to buy lunch, do yourself a favour and buy ORION: Dino Horde instead, and even better, buy some for your friends also.  A solid 11/5 from me, if only I could go higher.
3431	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA
561	1	a	Single-player FPS Tower Defense Game. Pick it up when on sale. Easy fun!
1172	1	a	BLANK TIME KILLER.
4471	0	a	This game is full of glitches and problems and should be labelled early access with a disclaimer. When I shoot, I don't see bullets coming out of my gun and when I use a vehicle turret the screen just shakes, with nothing coming out of the gun. It somehow still does damage to the dinosaurs though. I would not recommend buying it, even at the price of $0.75 unless you just want to get the trading cards or something.  I was wondering how the game got a rating of 'Mostly Positive', but after looking at several other comments, I found out that this game has been removed and re-added to Steam several times due to terrible ratings, so I wouldn't expect long-term support for this game either.
210	1	a	Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.  Putting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.  I didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.  Overall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.
411	1	a	Very fun with cheat engine. Im not a cheater. Cheat engine doesn't count
18	1	a	If you like casual games and you like an RPG style twist, then this little game was executed very well. The concept of using a standard card game as a fighting system works very well actually. Solid little game, I like it quite well!
2581	1	a	Really worth 99 cents :D 
1079	1	a	Hordes of Orcs and unlimited traps
5318	0	a	What a coinkydink, this game is similar to what comes outta my pie-hole when my diarrhea starts acting up! This game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥, and with what has been going on with their stolen models, I'd recommend my bowel movement products over this.
6307	1	a	It's for cheap fun with friends.
4610	1	a	A friend gifted this game to me. Though I'm not a big fan of these types of games (in fact, I suck at most shooting games), I decided to give it a try. At first I wasn't expecting much from a game that was a buck, but boy did we have a blast.There's a ton of crazy shenanigans you can pull off. Sure, the game has its own share of flaws, but the point of a game is to have fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more T-Rexs to clobber.
2349	1	a	I'm bad at writing reviews, but this game deserves another thumbs up, so here you go. Easily worth 10 to 15 bucks. Pure madness they are selling it this cheap.  Also, these devs deserve way more attention and praise. They kept working on their game, kept releasing free patches and updates for years. In a world where abandoned Early Access games and bug-ridden triple A titles are daily routine, these devs are showing exceptional dedication both towards their game and their customers.
3697	1	a	Body turned cold.
5770	1	a	It's sort of like the dinosaur child of Borderlands and Killing Floor. That said, it feels like it was made by a small team. This is not a problem, since the price is so dang low.
3128	1	a	Bought it for $0.50, more fun than games I've paid $30+ for, this thing is simply amazing.
919	1	a	All the same things from Orcs Must Die 2 apply to Orcs Must Die. If you own both games, the levels from the first can be played from within the second game. I'd recommend playing it from the second game as all the new customisation features will apply to first game's levels, and you'll be able to play as the sorceress.  If playing this from the first game there are a couple of things to note:  * Its customisation system is not nearly as good as the second game. * There isn't as much variety as there is in the second game. Applies to weapons, characters, traps and monsters. 
5082	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
4383	0	a	This game is more shity than my â¥â¥â¥â¥
143	1	a	You know from the developer said about Orcs Must Die:  Slice them Burn them Chop them Pound them Freeze them  You can use any methods to kill Orcs in this game, simple concepts but varies of executions. Your war mage is become like one man army, dealing with thousands of orcs every time you play this.  You got traps, guardian, spells and weavers to help you killing the orcs, you'll never regret it how things works out if you play this.   This is a hybrid of 3rd person shooter and Real Time Strategy (RTS) because you need to know what kind of trap that will make orcs unable to enter your rift and don't forget of Big Boys such as Ogres and Bat for the Air units.

15	1	a	Take one part Faerie Solitaire and two parts Puzzle Quest and mix in a little Poker or Yahtzee for good measure and you will get something like Runespell: Overture.   You're a changeling of some sort and you fight monsters and take quests in exchange for coin and buffs (which come in the form of power-up cards). There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you. The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting.  Admittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing.    Finding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.
6061	1	a	Defenitly a good game, much like Killing Floor. Need a lot of teamwork to succed against late wave, or else its a bloodbath.
4324	0	a	I decided to play solo, and I've been killed by a raptor who was at least 5m away from me. Then I decided to run a little test on their AI = basically walking heat-seeking missiles with claws. -10/10 would not play again
3413	1	a	This game isn't exactly one that has deep gameplay but well, shooting apart a bunch of dinosaurs with friends is just plain fun. If you grab it during a sale you'll probably get your money's worth.
5984	1	a	Wow this game is actually really fun. Who knew killing dinosuars is actually really fun xD
2108	1	a	10/10 best game ever  buy 4-pack and play with your m8
1323	1	a	OK, to be honest, they added simple nothing with this game and I can say first one was better than Shank 2 in almost every way. Story was terrible for me. It's all about going after someone called 'Helena' which we know almost nothing about her. Well, he raised Shank and some other guys from Rebellion that's all we know but we don't know why he goes after her. Apart from the story, they added some things like counter attack, using dropped weapons from enemies etc. They also messed up controls. Blocking is gone and you can only dodge now with the right analog stick. The old blocking button is pounce now and you can pounce fat enemies too. They added more epic soundtracks and animations but I still prefer first one's animations. They also added 'Survival Mode' and you can play online co-op, too. We couldn't because of annoying connection problems. Long story short, buy it if you really want to play Shank 2.
4633	1	a	Super Random game that kicks â¥â¥â¥

3667	1	a	Dis game? Best 0,99â¬ I've spent, EVER. That hooker I bought to give me a rimjob last week? Comes nothing near to the satisfaction I get from this game. This isn't what you would expect form a 0,99â¬ game.   10/10, would fly around on a helicopter with a MECH again.
4501	0	a	Server's dead. Bored now
5440	0	a	Today's Review: Orion: Prelude (Formally Orion: Dino Horde)  Let me tell you a story about a bunch of 'developers' that thought that would be a great idea to launch an indie game, poorly optimized (i'll say not even tried), multiplayer game with dinosaurs and guns (FPS) and how they fail at the point they had to drop permanently the price from 9.99 to 0.99 due the fact that no one will ever buy this crap or accept it for free, because they game sucks in every posible way, and i've played the slaughtering grounds, ride to hell retribution, RAMBO and other crappy games and this one it's the worst one, but hell, they reach steam without even passing trought greenlight so, there.  I'm not even gonna put a score to this crap, stay away from it!
1253	1	a	Really enjoyed this game, even more than it's sequel.
2060	1	a	Its a fun game that has phisics and has lots of stages and puzzles so you won't get board of it for a while. If you like puzzles this is a game that I recommend.
721	1	a	Good orginal.. innovative game.. and cheap if on sale.
4048	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
4734	1	a	So many people complain about such a failure the game used to be, just stop complaining and play the game for FUN, and not constantly talk about business within the game. Try it for yourself if you think you'll like it, thats why the price is down.
5804	1	a	this game is great for the price.
170	1	a	So many mangled/slashed/stabbed/burnt/crushed/melted orcs
3043	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs   175/10
5711	0	a	10 out of 10 i give this game a minus 50, wont play again,  if crap was a art piece this game would be it
3906	1	a	9/10 AMAZING!  I'd had my eye on this game for a while then it went on sale for $0.99. TOTALY worth it. The co-op is great even with only 3 classes. The music is nice and the visuals are breataking. I get such a rush too, there's nothing like gunning down a charging T-Rex and there's nothing cooler then having the game shift into bullet time when you take down one of the big boys.  Furthermore the extra modes are just as mun, pvp dules, rampage, conquest (don't get me started on conquest).  The only downside I find is the lack of diversity with the builds. It's not horrible but having three classes where their only differences are their abilities (Jetpack, Heal gun, and Stealth) does take away from some team elements that could be there.  Honestly, I'm having a blast (even more so than I did with TF 2!). $1 or $15, get this game .
713	1	a	I bought this game expecting to maybe play it for an hour and move on, but I ended up marathoning it from start to end. The gameplay is fun and innovative (you get a feeling of reward for creating complex traps and you really develop your own playstyle as you go), and the characters (that is, yourself, the mage, the enemy leader and the orcs) are easily likeable. I recommend it to anyone who's ever liked a tower defense game.
601	1	a	one comment were mentioning that game as  'hidden gem'  ought to buy now 'hidden gem 2' 
5919	1	a	Excellent game would definetly recommend. Vehicles, Purchase system, Jetpack, Dinosaurs, Co-operative play, and a great price of Â£0.79.
5446	0	a	Noooope.  Do not buy, horribly optimized, EXTREMELY bad gunplay that makes nerf guns feel like weapons of mass destruction. Animations are laughable and it's massively boring. I saw the reviews here and thought it might've changed - it hasn't. It's still as appalling as when I first saw it on a TotalHalibut/Biscuit video, and it feels exactly the same as it looked - and it was shoddy.  Even for 99p, which was how much it was on sale... no, don't get it. It's depressingly bland, boring and has such a bad feel to it, and it'll make you ashamed to see it on your steam library.  
4831	1	a	LOl there is one question..... why is this game so demanding????????? i play chrysis 3 on medium settings with better fps then this game with low
2941	1	a	Theres...Dinosaurs
3868	0	a	The metacritic might reflect a previous version, but it isn't that far off. Graphics are decent, flying around with a jetpack or the hoverbike is entertaining, but that's about where the good news dies off.  -Guns jerk around like the player is inside a paint mixer every time they pull the trigger. Using anything but a pistol is a waste against all but the largest of targets, sheerly because the odds of you hitting them while spazzing out is increased. -Tanks will get stuck or flip around if you get too close to anything. Anything. Even inside one, large mobs virtually one-shot you as they charge and gnash. The slam move they perform seems to have a 200 yard radius. Flying a heli late in the game is more about shooting down other flying enemies chasing you than helping your team directly with rockets. -Shooting lacks 'feeling' and there is a noticeable disconnect while firing. The enemies don't react to it, so combining those issues you more-or-less spam fire and wait until you see an enemy flop to the ground like a water balloon and aim at the next one.  -Guns sometimes don't even animate. You'll fire and see a flash but your avatar's hand doesn't jerk back, the gun remains frozen on screen. -Barring fliers and spitters, enemies cannot react to players on a cliff or anything other than a flat plane. Using a jetpack to reach something off the ground lets you fire at fish in a barrel as they pace around trying to find a way to reach you. -To limit this, flying mobs sometimes grab a player and lift them into the air. Shooting them drops you, which can easily be jetpack'd right back to where you were. Better yet, slowly strafe a foot left and right to avoid being picked up by them in the first place. -You can punt small enemies in the hoverbike, though speed doesn't seem to matter. Flying at max speed usually drops them, lightly tapping them usually punts them up or away a huge distance. My only guess is Aliens. -Did I mention this has an in-game cash shop, too? For only $50 you can get 75,000 coins to get skins, hats, and only the best priced bundles this side of Jurassic Park. -When you log in right now, you are promptly reminded that not only can you get this masterpiece on sale, but they also have a Kickstarter campaign starting in just over a day from right NOW! What are the odds of that? What luck!   End result: Thumbs emphatically -down-. If you like dinosaurs and cannot resist the urge, feel free to get it now while it is a dollar. Heck, get the four-pack so if any of your friends in the future, even long-term future, decide to want to get this, trade it to them for a TF2 hat or something. Spare them, anonymous review reader.   Spare them.
860	1	a	Wicked fun, Time waster Helps relieve the stress of TMH!!!
5242	1	a	Shoot big lizard it drop money good game 10/10
3349	1	a	.99 cent i played it longer then i ate a mc chicken... its better then some games i've paid more for.
154	1	a	Very fun tower defence game
2796	1	a	Ok, so the graphics aren't jaw-dropping and there are so many bugs with the animations, gameplay and pretty much everything else...but this game is awesome. Because it is just plain fun - there is no mind-boggling depth to it, it's not all srs bznz and you can genuinely have a laugh and just enjoy the ride. Even if you're a filthy casual, like me, you can jump right in with those who are a much higher level and not feel out of your depth or unable to get stuck into killing compys, taunting T-Rexes (or should that be rexi?) and punching pterodactyls in the face.  Because if this were real life, you would TOTALLY punch a pterodactyl in the face. Admit it.
2057	1	a	It's not bad i recommend this game, graphics are not the best but when you play this game after 1 hour you will like that game
3388	1	a	If you've got like 4 friends who really like either dinosaurs or shooting things this is going to be a blast for you. Easily 10 hours of gameplay.   And then theres people like me who like driving people around in awesome vehicles. I'm kinda wierd but this game scratches that itch too.   Just call me Mr. Transporter.
6008	0	a	For some reason this game gets put on sale multiple times. If you're looking for a hilariously bad game to play with your friends, this is for you.
4157	0	a	While the game might well be worth the dollar price it dropped down to, I cannot recommend the game simply because of the actions of the developer. The game was buggy, simplistic, and took a few tries to get to work, but was an amusing dino horde game. I'd be the first in line to recommend it for a few bucks.  However the name has been changed twice in an effort to throw off previous negative reviews, and I've heard numerous stories of saying the developer didn't propperly compesate his employees. If you don't care and just want a cheap dino horde game, this might be for you. Personaly I'll wait till the next one comes along.
4228	0	a	Thought this woudl be fun with some friends. Lasted for 2 hours, it's just too clunky and slow. Getting into the same server is a pain, and play is just not great.
6057	0	a	If you ever wondered how virtual garbage may look like.. Just buy this game and your desire for knowledge will be satisfied.
1578	1	a	Crash!...Bomb!...and Destroy! :]]
4990	1	a	A great game to play with friends, sure it may be clunky but all in all a hilarious shooter where you can fight dinosaurs with mechs and tanks etc.
3621	1	a	this game is the best game i have seen in my life but realy the laser guns is not good
1691	1	a	That game... is AMAZING, but pls. add co-op.
6109	1	a	I like this game in general good graphics and great gameplay are fun but the only problem is finding a match which is sometimes hard 
2151	1	a	Very good game for only 99 cents
2535	1	a	This is the best 75 cents you will ever spend on a game. Just buy it dammit. Its got terrible graphics terrible physics terrible sounds and the announcer sounds like he was ripped right off the Halo 1 disk and rammed into this game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ get enough kills and the announcer hollers bring me a pizza like â¥â¥â¥â¥ SON thats way better then any game already. Trust me if you want to have a great night with a group of friends playing an actually pretty smooth running comedy of a game buy it. DOnt ask questions. It doesnt get much better then this!
1297	1	a	Interestingly enough, I ended up picking up Shank 2 before the original. Don't ask why, I honestly don't remember other than it was somewhat of an impulse buy as I loved the demo. If you've played the original Shank, you know what you're getting into. If you haven't, Shank is a grind house style 2D action game where you shoot, slash, and sometimes shank your way through waves of enemies. The artwork is all 2D in a hand drawn style and looks beautiful. Excellent character animations (especially death animations) really bring the game to life. While the original Shank was relatively bare bones in terms of level presentation Shank 2 has a lot going on in these levels. It's not exactly Rayman Origins but it does look pretty great.  In terms of game play this is a huge step up from the original. There is a much better counter system, the grab system is a little more robust, and the game actually encourages you to try different weapons as there are far more enemy types in this game compared to the original. In the original, I made it through the entire game using the starter weapons, which is not how Shank 2 plays. Shank 2's levels are longer, more challenging, and require you to really think about your load out before each mission as you can't change on the fly like in the original Shank. Whereas in the original Shank the game was divided into bite sized levels (which helps a ton when attempting hard mode by the way), Shank 2's levels are fuller, longer, and always feature a boss battle at the end. While most bosses are actually quite more challenging than the original Shank there are a few that are pretty cheap and winning takes more luck than skill. Fortunately, once you get to a boss you have a checkpoint (even on hard mode) so you really get a chance to learn what you are doing wrong and how to overcome the enemy.  As far as controls go, however, I can't recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. I never even attempted it but as with most 2D, side scrolling games a controller is almost necessary for success. Fortunately, if you have a controller, the game controls beautifully. Actions are very responsive which helps when dealing with swarms.  In addition to the main story mode (which has two difficulties that don't stack with achievements) there is an online co-op survival mode. This is a welcome addition as the original Shank only had local co-op (which was fun, if a bit easy). This mode, however, is VERY difficult. There are a number of different stages and you are dealing with almost every type of enemy in the game. It takes practice, but with another player it's doable.   Regarding achievements there are far more than the first Shank (almost twice as many). Most of these are kill grinds with different weapons or level specific actions in addition to difficulty modes as well. The survival mode achievements are tough, but definitely possible if you have someone else. Trying it solo is not recommended.  Although I hadn't played the original Shank until after the sequel I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The visual style is amazing, the game play is fun and challenging, and even the soundtrack is pretty great. I would highly recommend playing the original Shank (even if it is an inferior game overall) as it will get you used to the play style. Even though it's not as good as the sequel it's still definitely worth playing and if you have a friend and two controllers, you can do the co-op campaign which is short and easy but still fun with two people).  I highly recommend Shank 2 to any action fans out there. The action is fast, fun, and extremely violent. There are a wide variety of enemies to fight (most requiring different strategies or weapon load outs) and some great boss battles.  8.5/10
850	1	a	Interesting game~
1426	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
4266	0	a	Orion: Prelude (previously known as 'Orion: Dino Horde' and before that 'Orion: Dino Beatdown') exemplifies poor design with just about every detail, from the graphics to the gameplay. Visual effects (Motion blur, lens flares, water droplets) are overused to an extreme, actually making it very difficult to see what you're doing in some cases. It's as if the developers saw an effect they liked and put it in because it looked kind of cool, without any thought to how it meshed with the rest of the experience. This pattern holds true for the rest of the game: features are either half-baked (class system is totally useless) or just poorly done (sound design and animations are just awful).  Perhaps the only thing worse than this game is its the community: they really put the 'cult' into 'cult classic'. Look at any review online and the comments section will be littered with comments ranging from claims that 'the game is much better now and deserves a re-review' to outright accusing the reviewer of slandering the developers. It holds a 'mostly positive' ranking on steam simply because fans bombard the review board with meaningless positive recommendations (probably so they can appear in one of the games trailers).  The idea had potential, but there really isn't anything redeeming about what Trek Industries made with it. The only selling point is that it's so cheap, but I'd actually recommend not buying the game just on the principle of not supporting such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ product.
4093	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
3685	1	a	It was a fun game in its original form, had many flaws though. But after all of its failures it came back as an amazing game and is a great example of developers being able to turn a game around for the better!
4708	1	a	Upset I bought this game and got nothing in return for them making it free.  Was a good game years ago.  EDIT:  I got helmets..
5966	1	a	awesome game for 1 dollar. Why is this game 1 dollar? not because its crap but because the devs are crazy. be warned though if your using a basic work PC this games not for you.  8.5/10

3357	1	a	Never wrote a review this long about a game but the reason why i wrote this was because i was tired of the negative reviews so here is my story: Bought the game when it was 99c and can say its 110% worth it, dont listen to the metacritic score or even listen to the negative people posting about this game. MOST people say its too much like halo.. but really? just because this is a SC-FI FPS game doesnt mean its halo.. the Damn game has dinosaurs how can you even start to think its like halo. i might as well say this game is like the movie avatar because they both have SC-FI and Mechs in it..then i might as well ALSO say that this game is like the new game coming out called TitianFall just because their is jetpacks and mechs..  Think of this game off a crossbreed off halo+killingFloor+Turok Halo beacuse it has SC-FI aspect to it Killing floor because it has a survial aspect to the game ( such of waves of dinos after you with side missions ) Turok simply because the dinosuars  Anyway their is plenty of game modes in it, very fun COOP, and so far loving the conquest mode. has day/night cycle , large maps that keep you exited ( Open world ) Mutliple basses and can loot boxs for gear/money to buy new weapons. And if you are tired of pairing up with teammates you can pick from the PvP game modes thats just as fun and can have a good laugh from it. even has GUNGAME mode in it and to top it off, you can even play as a dino yourself  you can also customize your guy as well which is pretty fun, stand out from the other players.   Graphics wise is pretty good so far, don't expect a battlefiled 4 style graphics but for what your paying for your getting a top notch game that the devs are constantly updating. even though the Orginal game they made back in 2012 ( dino beatdown) had negative reviews and didn't go so well, the devs didnt give up and made a huge update on this game.   Also check out there new project they are also working on called ' The Orion Project ' will definitely take some time before their new game comes out but check out the link below and you will be amazed at the ideas they are aiming for  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project   Long story short, Dont judge this game and say its halo.. alot of games now days have zombie survial and having dinosaurs just makes this game different
3481	0	a	I know why it's 99 cents. 'MICRO TRANSACTIONS'
3599	1	a	Spawend and a Dinosaur immediatly bit my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. 25/24 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ing have my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ torn off again.
1455	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
1401	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing loved Shank. Iâm putting that out there up front. I loved every minute of playing it. It was really really hard. Itâs been a while since Iâve played a game like that. Now, when I say âreally really hard,â I donât mean impossible. Super Meat Boy is impossible. I mean really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ challenging. Shank is by no means a perfect game, but itâs so much fun. Even if you arenât a fan of beat-âem-ups, I still recommend giving Shank 2 a shot.  Weâre going to pretend like I know what happened in the original Shank. Right? Right. Whatâs research?  Shank 2 is, as previously stated, a beat-âem-up game in which you play as (appropriately) Shank. Shank is a member of a rebel group who is defying the warlord, General Magnus. Magnus and his militia have taken over the government, essentially throwing the entire system out of whack. The militia is tearing the cities the government controls apart, taking in slave labor, burning entire villages, the whole shebang. For a game whose story is completely unimportant, Shank has a considerable amount of thought put into it. I mean, donât get me wrong, the story is a tired tale thatâs been done a million times over, but it sets up an excellent backstory for Shank.  Shankâs mentor, Elena, has been captured by the militia. Not only does she mean to world to Shank, but she also is the leader of the alliance group. Itâs up to Shank and his partner Corina to save Elena and take down Magnus once and for all.  The first thing you can note about Shank is that he is BADASS. He uses a flipping chainsaw and shotgun to take out hordes of enemies, cranes, superhumans, and airplanes. His weapons actually range from machetes to molotovs. Yeah, how flipping cool is that? Unfortunately, Shank isnât a relatable character in the slightest. I know that the game wasnât going for an emotional tale, but whatâs the point in having a backstory at all when you canât feel any emotions toward the characters? Shank, and even Corina, to an extent, were too Gears of War-like for me to actually care about why I was killing all of these deranged lunatics.  Putting the stupid characterization aside for a moment, Iâd like to discuss the flashback I was continuously having during my playthrough. There was a game made for the SNES called Blackthorne. Maybe you have heard of it. In, a badass character runs around shooting a shotgun to save prisoners, etc. I havenât personally played the game, so I canât attest to how good it is, but Iâve seen in played and learned about it. There are so many callbacks to Blackthorne that it isnât even funny.  Let me give you some examples. Blackthorneâs signature move was shooting with a shotgunâ¦ one handed and backwards. Guess what Shank can do? Of course, there is the obvious saving prisoners from the bad guysâ¦ I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Before you go calling Shank and Blackthorne the same game, though, recognize that Blackthorne was actually a cinematic platformer. This is a genre that isnât really touched on as much nowadays, with the exception of the recent re-release of Flashback. My point is, whether they meant to or not, the developers of Shank made Blackthorne cool again.  Before we dive into the gameplay, letâs talk about the art of the game. The animations are all very comic-book-like, which Iâve always been a fan of. The animations are simple and cartoony for such a violent game, but this is hardly detrimental. What isnât the best part of the game is the music which isâ¦ bland. Sure, it sounds epicâ¦ at firstâ¦ and then it gets repetitive and fades into the background. There isnât anything wrong with it, per say, but it isnât as good as I would like it to be.  Shank is hard. I know Iâve said that a lot, but Iâm trying to ingrain this into your mind. There are two modes of the story: Normal and Hard modes. Normal mode is doable, but Hard isâ¦ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard. In Normal mode, you get plenty of health powerups, checkpoints, infinite lives, etc. In hard mode, you get very few powerups, next to no checkpoints, and infinite lives. To give you a quick perspective, I beat Normal in about four hours, give or take. I have yet to get past the third level in Hard.  Some of the better things about Shank are his weapons. You see, there are a variety of weapons, like I said earlier. Each weapon has a different amount of damage, speed, and some variation of stun. You will be able to find which weapons work best for you as you play the game. You donât unlock all of the weapons until the last few levels, and by this point youâve probably already figured out what you wanted. For instance, my lineup was the Chainsaw, the Shotgun, and the Grenades.  I like that the game balances out the weapons. You have a real chance to figure out which weapons are best for your playstyle. If youâre like me, you like to deal with one problem at a time. This is where the Chainsaw and the Shotgun came in handy. If you like to take on lots of enemies at once, you may find that the Pistols and Machetes work better for you. Even when it seems like a weapon is unbalanced, youâll find that it has a certain ability, like leaving enemies burning in your wake. The weapons are arguably the best part about the game.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward. Itâs almost, but not quite, button mashing. The enemies range quite a bit in size and power, so some weapons will work better on them than others. For example, when I was in close quarters with several enemies, Iâd end up flailing about and murdering all of them with my Shotgun. If I needed to clear the field and make space, Iâd use the Chainsaw. Youâll find that just using one will not work. Youâll need to chain combos together to help you take down the multitudes of enemies.  Speaking of multitudes of enemies, there are quite a bit of them. These basic enemies range from swordsmen, to female ninjas, to guys with pistols, to guys with machine guns, to guys with axes, to midget bomber, to gigantic â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cretinsâ¦ There are so many. Each level may or may not present you with different enemies. Occasionally, this could just mean the same enemy reskinned, but some levels do include zone-specific enemies.  The best enemies are the bosses. And there are not as many as I would like. The levels in Shank only end up being about 20-30 minutes long apiece, and there are only eight levels. This does mean there is variety in bosses, but there arenât enough. For such a BA guy, youâd think heâd constantly be taking on guys three or four times his size.  That being said, the bosses are awesome and also not. Each one of the focuses on a different aspect. For example, there is a psychic boss, and thereâs fire boss, and thereâs a strength boss. Each of these bosses seem perfectly fit for their levels. Alternatively, there are minibosses in some stages. For example, the crane I mentioned earlier. It has been a long time since Iâve had this much rage towards a boss in a gameâ¦ You canât hit the crane unless youâre using your gun. The crane repeatedly tries to smash you with a boat that takes up a third of the screen while guys with pistols try to take you out from a mile away. Itâs tough. But I beat it. I canât get past in on the Hard mode, but I got in Normal.  The bosses are not awesome in some partsâ¦ Mostly because they all use the same tactics. To a degree. They have a predetermined moveset that consists of maybe five moves at the most. Once you take out about a third of their health, they all call backup. Itâs the same thing every battle. On top of that, once you figure out the movesets of each boss, they arenât that hard to beat. Hell, even the final battle against Magnum I beat on my second try. For a game that can be as challenging as Shank, the bosses arenât hard enough.  ......read more of this review at  http://theoblivianstudios.com/post/62088773680/review-shank-2 
1003	1	a	I never thought towerdefence and third person mixed well until now
4141	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
4279	0	a	i honestly don't have a clue what is going on
948	1	a	A tower defence game that's all kinds of entertaining, engaging, and challenging. And while it has all of the usual trappings of a tower defence game, it also functions as a third-person shoter, allowing you to get in on the carnage. Use your traps and spells/weapons to liquify, crush, scorch, grind, and perforate thousands of orcs as they try vainly to infiltrate your castle. If watching orcs be electrocuted and set on fire while being sucked into a meat grinder is your thing, then this might just be the game for you!
5510	1	a	Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead really i have mixed feelings on this games so eat some pancakes!  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.
4765	1	a	A mash up between the future and the time before man. Daring conflicts to defend things that aren't really needed to be there. A cheap game and worth a try.   Only problem is, if your computer's crap. You'll face lag.
2911	1	a	I just threw a grenade down the throat of a T-rex that was trying to eat me. Need I say more?   Well I'm going to anyway. The graphics are very clean and play is very smooth. I can't even describe the feeling of taking down multiple large dinos with teammates and the satisfaction of learning how to use the classes well (I still love Assault the best, if only for the jetpack).  If you like co-op FPS survival games like Killing floor (and to some extent the L4D line), you will love this game. By my 2nd day playing the devs had even had an event, so I know they are involved with community. As usual a good group will go a long way toward you enjoying your playtime, so I definitely recomend getting a few friends to play with you.   I can't speak to the PvP element yet because I prefer Co-Op but I've enjoyed the Co-op play so much that I'm definitely going to check the PvP out and that is something I'm not normally drawn to very often.
225	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.  Technically:    the game is a fantasy / medievial 'tower' defence + third person 'shoot everything that survived trap lines',    30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable    20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay,    nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay,    challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,   Gameplay notes:    The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,     The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave,    Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line,    Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff,    Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast,    Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them,    During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade.    Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story.    Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps,    No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2),    It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.    All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy.    The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad. Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.     His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity.    The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage.    Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall). Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one).    The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.   General info    OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle / dungeons. There is only one level theme.    Forget about cinematics. The storyline is presended via semi-animated drawings. This is a great idea and fits great into the game.    The orcs, the Warmage and the traps have a bit grotesque, comic design. Again, this suits the overall game mood, and slows down graphics 'aging'.    Amazing music. If you run into game OST, do buy it. I managed to get one from Humble Bundle.   Any problems?    Trap balance - some traps are simply better, some are just useless (Hint: use traps with large AOE and fast or no reload),    Since trap upgrades are permament, The Warmage usually sticks with favourite set with little room for experiment.    No co-op game (solved in OMD2)    The super-arogant hero can be hard to get used to. The humor can be sometimes percieved as primitive.    High emphasise placed on combat, it is not possible / extremly difficult to play only with the economy.    First two levels in nightmate are... too nightmareish, the difficulty seems to be easier further.    there are two levels in the game (including final), which must be simply learnt and played by hearth. In each wave the  Mage must build traps in particular area, buy a proper upgrade and solo secure another corridor.  Mispacing traps will leave the attacked corridor unsecured.     Strong sides    humor,    nice character design,    good overall ballance in map design,    good balance of strategic / economic components in gameplay (unless you don't like action in tower defences),    interesting maps,    high 'replayablity', level score to be maxed.   You should avoid the game, if you:    dislike action in tower defence and prefer them to be purely economic,    dislike arrogant and dumb protagonists   Do play if:    don't mind thinking / action hybrid,    look for a lot of fun,    tend to max each level  
2267	1	a	This game started out as 'meh whatever' and is now skyrocketing somewhere between 'neat' and 'awesome'. While it's not a AAA title game it is also not available for $50- anything below $15-20 for this game is something you cannot say no to. Whether you just wanna mow down a ton or Dinos with your friends or wanna mow down a ton of friends as a dino- this is the game for you.
5599	1	a	How can I review this game I don't even own it.
2432	1	a	This game is good for its price but i would like to see offline modes survival etc. 
2994	1	a	I played it once before it was free for a few days i loved it.  What i like :  - You can be a dinosaur and â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. - You can â¥â¥â¥â¥ the dinosaurs and steal theire babies. - Has COOP and Online. - Can pick a few dinosaurs that are funny like the one that suicide bombs. - I like the graphic personally.  What i don't like :  - The fact that it dosn't have alot of players cause IGN rated it bad and same as the other.   I like this game but it has no one.. You could get it at a discount for 50 cents i got it for 73 cents i think. I reccomend it but don't buy it at the moment it dosn't have alot of players i want this game to be Popular again.
320	1	a	I'd let those damn orcs win if they stop running straight in to arrow traps and spike traps and falling in to acid pits the damn orcs got â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rocks for brains
1479	1	a	Good fun to play, but honestly a lot more fun if this had co-op. Co-op is only in limited survival mode...bah!
3460	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated â¥â¥â¥â¥.
463	1	a	Great game, fun if you want to waste some time or blow some steam. Not serious at all, and tons of fun.
5458	0	a	I can't play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game without barfing everywhere.
846	1	a	Very Fun 3rd Person Tower Defense!  Tony Seal of Approval
1378	1	a	One of the best 2d brawlers I have ever played
5195	0	a	A long time ago, my mother made me go outside all the time. I did not want to, as I believed that I could do something better with my life, such as play quality games. And, I had heard the odds of cancer forming within my poor little body if I obeyed her wishes. I did not want to get cancer. During the times I refused to go outside because of these two factors, I looked far and wide for quality gameplay. Low and behold, Steam was found. I downloaded Steam. An eager chap I was, wishing to play all the fun and popular games. I avoided cancer at all costs. I did not smoke, I did not partake in any nefarious activities, and most importantly, I did not go outside. It appears my efforts were wasted anyways, as this game gave me cancer.
1391	1	a	Klei Entertainment did not disappoint with Shank 2. Inspired by Grindhouse flicks (from what I've read) Shank 2 places you in the shoes of Shank. I don't really know much about Shank since I didn't play the first game but I will give my 2 cents on the story and gameplay.  Story:  The story is kind of weak. Shank goes to his hometown to see his mother figure Helena. In between the 2 games a new military government has taken over and they are bad dudes/dudettes. Shank only starts fighting them because one of them makes him mad. After that he just mellows out on some booze before he goes to see Helena. The military sets the town on fire while he is drinking. When he attempts to get to Helena he sees her along with other villagers being hauled away by the military. So begins Shank's quest to save his mama.  You don't need to know much about Shank except that he is a cool dude. It would've been nice if he smiled or cracked a joke or did not sound like an old man in the restroom when he got hurt but that is just my opinion. You can also play as Corina, Shank's foster sister, in a level along with the multiplayer. She is a determined rebel member who is probably not a drunk. But you don't get to know her much either.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is excellent. You have a light attack, heavy attack, bombs, and guns. You can juggle people around using the light attacks. You can also pick up weapons on the road that are super powerful but only have a few uses like a bat, a pipe, an IV pole, and a sink. There is also a dodge mechanic which works really well. You can dodge at any point in your attacks. The dodge function will cancel out your attack so you wonât get hit because you are in the middle of one. There are also environmental traps you can activate to kill your enemies. There are a variety of enemies that will keep the game fresh. You have quick grenade throwers, regular dudes, fat dudes that laugh like Scooby Doo, and heavy dudes that go 'hoo rah!' when they do a spin attack. Each game has a boss as well.  If you like beat em ups then this is a game you will not want to miss. A coop survival mode (I have not played) will add replay value and there are also leaderboards, a hard mode, and intel to collect. Getting achievements also unlocks skins.  Buy it!
772	1	a	Just plain simple gory fun
175	1	a	It's very fun, but I'm mostly just writing this for the coal.
3760	1	a	Great game I love it the Meta Critic score is bs atleast give it a GOOD try and its amazing!!!!!!!
2291	1	a	'Very Great Game indeed' -Quote from ME! :D  I would play this game MORE often if I get a better Pc,Who wouldnt buy a game thats 1$ and great graphics! :D
4240	1	a	These are the type of developers I support. They admited their mistakes, they started working on it and updated it for 3 years. They deliverd a stable game--for only 1 euro. This is Worth A Buy, even when you're not into this type of game, I advise you to buy it. We needs these type of developers on Steam or we will pay the price eventually.  
2651	1	a	its cheap , cool and fun
1930	0	a	copy of mario
1699	1	a	Simple and nice concept game 7/10
43	0	a	I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.
836	1	a	A fantastic frantically paced tower defense/action hybrid done right. Good for hours upon hours of simple orc and ogre slaying delight.
274	1	a	Orkmobslashing headshotspreading corpsestomping greenskinshredding gnollstunning fun. Seriously. Try the demo, if you don't believe my supreme Opinion of supremeness, which is supreme.... by superiority! ;D
4758	1	a	A few things that make this game a damn good multiplayer: 1. You get to play as a T-rex and a Spinosarus 2. You get the same kinda gameplay as Halo and other high tech shooters 3. You get to fight said T-rex and Spino with mechs and tanks 4. Im The Bay Harbor Butcher  And yup those are all the reasons why you need this game
5889	1	a	Good game to play with friends.
6292	1	a	Oh hell ya lots of fun.. I feel like i robbed you guys for the price I paid.
5884	0	a	worst game ever lol
1238	1	a	Best tower defense-style game ever. Still holds true to this day.
2127	1	a	I was honestly unsure of this game, a friend of mine had bought it for me so I gave it a go. Now there is an issue with lag at some times but it is rare. The up of this game, well it's just fun as hell. I love getting in the cars and just plowing over the raptor. Even my son plays this game with me on another computer. the game is multiplyer or you can go solo if you so wish.
4548	0	a	this game contains so much aids
2443	0	a	Oh boy, this game.  The game isn't horrible, at least not as horrible as metacritic says it is. But it still isn't good. Everyone else has explained what the game is like so I'll just do a pros and cons list.  Pros -  -It's 99 cents. -Can be fun with friends. -Graphics are mostly nice. They aren't bad, but the player models are kind of weird looking.  Cons - -Animations are horrible -Dinosaurs have skin made of steel. -Boring when played alone -Definitely not worth 15 dollars.  Overall, 6/10 would not recommend. May want to get it now since it's a dollar, but for 15 dollars, you'd expect more.
2096	1	a	Killed everyone with only a knife and 200 ping. Amazing.  21/10
2041	1	a	Very simple but fun if u got time to burn.
2664	1	a	I was told this game was really bad by friends. With a free weekend we started to play the revamped version and I must say it is a blast to play coop on CONQUEST. I will be supporting there new kickstarter on feb 27 for an open world game. Give this game a try and you will not regret it, this team has pulled a complete 180 with their game and you can see with their updates that the truly care.
2434	0	a	Feeling like i was scammed i bought the game when it costed money but now it is free devs can you return my money because this is now f2p  To anyone who bought this i feel your pain
1840	0	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
3498	0	a	save your money...bad optimization, poor framerates, super laggy even with good internet connection.
4085	1	a	Good game, couple of bugs, but you can get used to live along with it, great gameplay
3062	1	a	its not a complete or balanced game, but for a $1 it's fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play with friends. Also it has fire-breathing robot reindeer &amp; a robot santa claus in the santaslair map, how can you not give this a try.
3516	0	a	4/10 It has its moments..Rarely
6015	0	a	I saw this game on sale for a buck and thought 'Why not?' I had fun with it, but that fun gets outshone by several problems with the game which I am surprised are still there for a game that was released over 2 years ago.  First off, the game. It's a game where you are set against hordes of dinosaurs, ranging from quick raptors that try to hunt in in groups, to triceratops that will charge at you, to T-Rexs which will just gobble you up. You have a variety of weapons to choose from: pistols, rifles, shotguns, explosives, and even a bow and sword. You can also hop in vehicles, such as trucks, tanks, and VTOLs. With three classes (a flying type, a medic type, and a cloaking type) you have ample options to wreck those dinos. Of course, there is the PvP modes as well, where you can play as the dinosaurs as well.  Before I start getting into the problems I had with it, let me say this: I did have fun. You can have a lot of fun with the game when it is working. My favorite loadout is jetpack, grenade launcher, and shotgun, with a little extra armor for good measure. I can tear through hordes of dinos while flying around like a fairy. It is also entertaining to have a jeep plow through the enemy while your buddy is shooting from the turret on the back. So yes, I had fun with the game.  However, I really can't recommend this game because of some glaring issues with it. 1. Connection issues. Connecting to server is iffy at best. Some times it will connect you to a game, and then instantly disconnect you. This happens quite a bit. Other times, you'll be midmatch, then be disconnected even though there was no indication of a bad connection. Sometimes lag will be horrendous. Players teleporting around your screen, and bullets seeming to vanish a foot in front of you. About 30% of my time had no issues. The other 70%, I was having trouble connecting, or getting dropped from a server. I've had several really good runs ruined by a random disconnect. It is extremely frustrating.  2. No tutorial. None whatsoever. It took me over an hour before I realized I had grenades(press g to throw). Also, you would think space would control the jetpack, but it's set to ctrl for some reason. You can melee, but again, you don't know that unless you hit it on accident, ask someone, or run accross it in the keybindings. It was even longer before I figured out how the augments system works(just an fyi, you can have an infinite number of augments equipped. You buy them by double-clicking. You can also buy an augment more than once for some reason. It doesn't boost you though, it just takes your credits). Altogether, there may be some fun stuff I am missing, but I don't know what those are because it isn't made obvious.  3. The graphics are all over the place. The dinosaurs look really good. The enviroments look all right. The player models just look horrible. Even when playing on high settings, they look blocky, or the texture messes up really badly. As for the weapons, some of them look really cool, such as the burst-fire rifle(I don't remember what it's called). Other weapons look extremely uninspired. The shotgun I like to use looks like a tube with some lights and wires. Also, a number of icons look extremely low resolution. They should really be polished up. The vehicles are all over the place in terms of style. Most have s silvery shine and lights, some are dark and grey, and the hoverbike looks like it is from a different game entirely with its turqoise paint.  4. Balance. The balance is odd at times. For example, a knife is pretty powerful, but the sword is pretty weak. That's a really weird decision, especially since it costs more credits to get the sword than the knife. Also, the grenade launcher is probably too powerful. I love to use it, and I am saying it is too much. I just wreck dinos with it, until I'm overflowing with credits I can't use. At times, my teammates are running low on funds because they can't really compete with a GL. Another weird decision is the turrets. I have only seen someone use one once because they only last 60 seconds, even though you most likely will not be able to afford one until wave 8/10. I don't know why you would pay 20,000 credits for one (the same price as some of the most powerful weapons in came), and people I have played with can't justify buying them either. Another issue I had was with the augments, one case in particular. There are two augments that affect jumping, one which increases your jump height(by a lot) and one which gives you double jump(which is unaffected by the previous augment). The jump height upgrade is flatout better than the double jump. There is a very noticable difference in heights you can reach between the two.  5. The shooting. For the most part, the guns feel pretty weak. They don't do a whole lot of damage, they don't sound powerful, and they can be extremely innacurate. Especially when you buy some of the more expensive guns, they don't do much damage to justify their cost. Sometimes, guns are innacurate for the weirdest of reasons. For example, the turret on the back of the car. If you look to the left or right with it and fire, the bullets will hit several feet to the left or right of where you aimed. I felt something was off when driving around with it, then tested it while stationary. Even while sitting still, if you aren't looking straight forward or backwards, it won't hit where you aim. I really don't understand why that is.   6. Bugs. Some of the bugs I have run into: -not spawning in a match. You are supposed to spawn when a new wave starts, but I've had several times where this had not worked. -in the player customizations screen, my character would not be centered on the screen. About half the time, my character model would be off to the side under the menus where I coulndn't seem him. -as mentioned before, you can buy augments more than once. I accidently bought an augment twice while playing, losing valuable credits. -in the keybindings, you can set vehicle steering to be either controlled by A and D, or by mouse. This doesn't work, it will always be controlled by mouse. I never got it to work. -sometimes, when reviving a teammate, the meter will disappear. You are still reviving them, you just can't see it, so don't stop holding E.  7. Just weird little quirks: -the tank has a second, smaller turret on top, similar to what is in the car, but it is still controlled by the driver. They could really make the tank a two-seater and give control of the secondary turret to him. -dinosaur spawning. We lost several vehicles because dinosaurs spawned on top of us while driving by. That really ruined the mood. -the flying dinosaurs(called Rhams according to the wikia) can turn on a dime. They'll fly at a player from above to try and hit him, but will stop and turn really quick, making them difficult to dodge, as well as being difficult to predict and shoot. -there is an indicator on your HUD showing you how many magazines you have left. However, the games doesn't use a magazine system. Ammo is just taken from your ammo pool and dumped into your gun.  So while it is fun at times, a lot of stuff can and does go wrong. If you can get it on sale, great, you'll find some entertainment with it. I got it for a dollar. But I cannot recommend paying 15 dollars on it, as well as spending real money for cosmetic items in the in-game shop.
4381	1	a	Honestly, I'm torn as to whether it's actually worth a dollar or not.  On one hand, it could be great fun if you've got a full group of friends to play with.  On the other... good god, the bugs, the pointlessness of an entire class (of only three!), the repetitiveness, and the fact that a god-awful player can screw you over on Conquest by stealing your vehicle...
575	1	a	The fact that, with all the games I could be playing at this point, I've been going back to this one repeatedly to finish a new level, says a decent amount about it alone. I love classic Tower Defense style games, which this most resembles, and it does those parts well. Even if it was just setting the traps and watching the Orcs gib, that would probably be enough, but the FPS aspects (with which you can win without setting a trap at all on some levels) and are also well done and fun to use or (as I tend to do) supplement your traps by stunning orcs in range.

1090	1	a	I was hesitant about this game as I find 3rd person views to be very console'ish but was pleasantly surprised. The PC controls are solid and the traps are very satisfying. I wish the levels were longer or you started with more money because it seems like just as you get a really good chain of traps setup then the level is over. That's a minor complaint--overall the game is great.
521	1	a	I have never been the biggest fan of Tower Defense games. But after playing a good 7 hours of Orcs Must Die over the last 2 days, I can honestly say that this title gets a spot on my favorites list. Robot Entertainment has produced a challengeing, trhrilling, laugh out loud chaotic little gem. Nothing quite equals the satisfying feeling of frantically rushing around, strategically lining the corridors of a fortress with implements of death, and then watching your assailants fall in droves under hails of arrows, floor spikes, wall blades, and brimstone tiles. The 3rd person over the shoulder camera puts you smack in the middle of the chaos, immediatley lending the game a sense of urgency you don't feel in other TDG's simply because your character's life is in peril because your character is THERE. Humor, depth, and white knuckled pacing set the tone for a well made, fun game that is worth picking up. (Especially at such a low price.)
2590	1	a	After only playing the game for a matter of a half hour I managed to get stuck in a dino, watch as my team mate flew into the sunset carried off by a pterodactyl. I got bumrushed by Compsognathus (tiny rat looking things from Jurrasic park, you know the miniture t-rex's)  Wan2play.net  9/10 gives this game a 9 out of 10 the only thing they need to work on is minor glitches and support for AMD users other then that I think this game is well worth a dollar
1600	1	a	Simple, classic tower defense with some tactical depth and a high difficulty level. Gets slightly repetitive at some point, but hey... it is tower defense.
1224	1	a	If you don't like this game, you do not like having fun. Get it, it's worth every penny. The DLC is pretty good too.
45	1	a	I do not understand card games. But I won't make a negative review about this game only because it's not my kind of the game. It seems okay... It just does not make my diÑÐº hard enough to play it.
5959	1	a	Absolutely AMAZING!!!! So worth your money!! JUST GET IT IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI FPS/DINO GAMES!!!!!!! This is a great addition to your first-person shooter collection!
6444	1	a	Hey There Mr.dinosaur.. AHHH F*CK NOOO NOO NOOO NOOOOO DONT F*CKING EAT ME... â¥â¥â¥...   If you pay for it, I feel sorry for your 99 cents... not really I got this game for free from owning The original ORION game, and from what Ive played of it its incredibly difficult to start out. When you encounter a dinosaur in FFA, YOU WILL DIE, unless its one of those smaller chompers. overall the game is good, when kiddies arent camping and Cross-mapping you to death. 7 1/2 out of 10.
6273	1	a	this game is extremely fun to play with a friend or two but never play alone.
700	1	a	Such an amazingly awesome &amp; addictive game, love it!!!
5395	1	a	5/5
4912	0	a	I dont like this game and I dont recommend it to anyone,you will have to pay it for 6 days,you just shoot in this game it has no point,so if you like first person shooter games without a story this is for you,but if you dont you shouldnt play it.It should be free to play,because its to stupid to pay for it.
915	1	a	It might be singleplayer only, but I haven't had this much fun with a game since I first played Team Fortress.
5269	1	a	I just impulse bought two copies of this game: one for me and one for a friend. This game is....   INCREDIBLE!!!!!! I love this game, it's awesome! You can punch dinosaurs in the f**king face! I bought a bow, the jetpack augment, and I stood on a rock popping raptor heads like Macklemore pops tags. After that I got a walking turret and killed 10 raptors with one rocket. This game is so damn fun, I'd have paid $5 if I knew this game was so good (but I don't have that much so don't make me)  I just wish I could get a cape. I love capes. By the way, the only paid stuff (real money shizz) is vanity items from what I can tell. This game is definitely worth your moneys.
5805	1	a	This game. It is just simply amazing.   I came into it with the most low hopes I've ever had. It was cheap as hell and everyone was making fun of the people who voted for it to be on the community sale. I decided to see what all the uproar was about and made the 5 dime plunge. Plugged in my 360 controller (supported) and to my delight, the game handled brilliantly. The controls are nice and tight. With sprinting, crouching, sliding, jumping, jetpacking... the works. It feels like many a AAA shooter I've played in the past.  Nothing is really explained. You have to dive in head first and just experience it. It plays like a mix of Dungeon Defenders + Sanctum + Turok = WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY COMPLAIN ABOUT.  Seriously though, buy the 4 pack and give the copies to some like minded buddies for a weekend (or much, much more) of zany bliss.
1212	1	a	It's a good game if you like to place traps and have several options to win.
3084	1	a	I had to delete my old review, the game is very different now.  My review: it looks like a lot of fun, some good features, good all-round co-op survival game. Except that it has these floating damage numbers that appear every time you hit something and while you can toggle ALL of the HUD, you can't turn that â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. So i won't be getting into it because that 1 flaw ruins the entire immersive value.   tl;dr if youre not an immersion gamer, but arcade or casual, you'll like it I think so I still recommend the game.
3224	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rad. you get to BE dinosaurs!!1 and then you get to KILL dinosaurs!!!1 how sick is that?! direct ripoff of halo by the way.
2258	1	a	YOU SHOOT DINO'S  AND DRIVE MECHS AND DRAGON FLYS (TO GET MAD AIR)  WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ MORE DO YOU WANT?
2648	1	a	Awesome game for such a low price! Definitely worth it!
2916	1	a	subpar in just about every way, and poorly optimized. BUT has some interesting ideas and innovative mechanics which you rarely see in an fps. id love to see this one picked up by a major studio but only if it would stay faithful to the original concept and gameplay quirks. like everyone else has said, its way more fun than it ought to be, and its only 99c!
595	1	a	So much fun playing it. recommend game to play
1587	1	a	a nice and simple tower defence best played windowed becoz its in 4:3 this is also the only reason i like pacific more (thats 16:9) but in the end its basicly the same game with a few less tweaks than pacific its worth its money for sure but if i had to pick i would get the other  8/10
2303	1	a	Okay, Metacritic failed the score for this game! I got this when it was on sale for $1, but I still recommend it at its $15 price tag. Basically, its killing dinosaurs with mechs, and on a lot of servers, you can BE a dinosaur.  Hours of fun, so buy it now. Overall rating: 88/100
1083	1	a	this game is so much fun.
4929	0	a	Altough its cheap its not bad, but its not too good, lets go to plus and minus  +Its cheap +Dinosaur +Good graphic +Good control  -It doesnt have any player online -Its single mode suck -Bad AI  Maybe you should buy the new Orion game, its on Kickstarter
4661	1	a	Selling gift of this game, invite me, we will make a deal! :)
1353	1	a	6
1022	1	a	A very simple premise of a game - stop a whorde of orcs from making it from one end of a maze to another utilizing a couple of weapons and a variety of 'semi-humorous traps.' The orcs come in a series of waves, and those waves get longer and more difficult until the end of each level. As you complete levels, you gain additional types of traps, and the more you succeed, you gain points to spend to upgrade those traps to make them more powerful.  Overall, this is a very simplistic game... first person shooter meets tower strategy. But, it's kind of addicting, as the traps lend a bit of humor in to the fray, often being used to knock orcs around the maze and off ledges - and a variety of other things that aren't worth spoiling for anyone.  Wait for a good Steam Sales (such as the weekend one presently going on) and add the entire franchise to your collection for less than $10. It's definitely worth that for some nearly-mindless entertainment! And, with a Steam-based leaderboard, you can compete with your friends.
3254	1	a	This game is actually really good...
5846	1	a	This game is really fun. I've only played it a bit but its really addicting.
4316	1	a	best 1 euro spent of my life
1654	1	a	Inception:The Game
4086	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
3706	0	a	While .99cents, I would not buy this game until it is functional at least. No audio normalization, no customization without actual money, survival mode is a gimmic and fighting dinosaurs with guns that feel weak and disconnected. Servers are hosted locally. Vehicles are a joke. Healing is a joke. Damage feels like nothing. Controls are sticky and numbing and there is no replayability except if you want to achievement â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I guarantee you that your money will be wasted on this game. I would relate this to a 500 year old ghetto house. You can buy the house for cheap but everything inside is crap and falling to pieces. This game was hastily cobbled together and updates are pathetic. This game needs a complete rework, with effort actually put into designing the gamem
3840	0	a	Terrible, just really, unfortunately bad. Laggy and buggy controls, poor gameplay, just not nearly as fun as it should be.
336	1	a	Its a must buy because:  - game is cheap - game is cool - game is fun - achievements are reasonable - can be play as casual or more hardcore
4244	1	a	Really fun game
2797	1	a	There're dinosaurs in this game.
2830	1	a	It's like call of duty meets dinosaurs.. but not exactly. It's really fun and addicting!
5922	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN FOR 99 CENTS IT IS BAD IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE FAT CHODE
4557	1	a	This is a mainly multiplayer game but you can play versus bots if you really need to,though it is really not recommended to do so since that really takes away from the whole 'stay with your team to survive' feels. There's alot of diffrent gamemodes to choose from but mainly there's 2, atleast what I found, which is survival and Deathmatch. The game dosen't take that long to learn and the controlls are relativly easy to learn.It's a relativly fun game to play with some freinds on a LAN party.  It will most probably turn pretty boring after some hours of gameplay.    **** PROS AND CONS****  + Easy to learn +   Only cost 0.99â¬   Free-to-play + Lots of modes   - Edit: Early supporters that bought the game gets nothing in-game for their support - Not alot compelling about the game after yyou play certain matches on the main modes      *** Overall rating***  ***6/10***     
238	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
6372	1	a	
1670	1	a	This is the soul of video games right here: one man doing all the artwork, music, and programming for a game. It's how the industry began! The result in this case is something more unique than most corporate-funded teams would ever think of, much less dare to release.  Ever seen the movie 'Existenz'? Don't. It's silly. See 'The Thirteenth Floor' instead. It's way better. Anyway, both movies tackle the idea of recursive realities. Inside a Star-Filled Sky puts CONTROL of that concept at the core of a gaming experience. That enemy's too tough? Enter him, dumb-down his abilities, exit, then waste him with ease. Alternatively, enter yourself, learn Kung Fu, exit, then waste him with ease.  Jason Rohrer has made a game that's thought-provoking, moderately mind-bending ('What was I trying to do again? And which level of reality IS this?!'), a good bit of pixelphilic fun, and simply worth your money. If nothing else, I admire his proper use of hyphenation. Support literate games!
764	1	a	Funny as hell, DLC is a must though, especially when you want to complete the starter levels without any trouble...
3095	1	a	This game used to not be good at all. However the developers are amazing, listened to their fans, and turned this into one of the most fun games you can buy on steam right now. I've played this game for hours on end (on a different account if you're confused about my play time) and will continue to do so for a long time. Buy this game if for nothing else than to support developers who care about their player base
5935	1	a	This is the best cheapest halo clone i've ever played. They even ported in the warthog, tank, and magnum, along with mechwarrior mechs. I've gotten better value playing this rediculous game than many others in my library that cost 10-50x more.
1417	1	a	Shank is back with more brutal style combat animations. Action platform is rised to more deadly and overall are harder than the origin. The story is about conflict between rebels and militia. It's shorten and less interest than origin. For the combat, there're variaty of melee weapons, but some are cut and limited in your inventory. Enemy now can do damage even you're fell on the ground, so be careful! I'm really disappoint that developers cut co-op campaign mode off. But replace with survival mode as tradition. Well, it pretty fun with various characters. But they should maintain the old ones, not just cut them off including team combo. By the way, it's good game and great Maxican art style. I hope Shank 3 would be focused on both story and gamemodes.
2383	1	a	Stupid amount of fun, especially with friends. Worth it for the price no doubt
3675	1	a	Better Than PRIMAL CARNAGE !!  Jst give it a shoot
105	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
6056	1	a	The T-rex's roar is earsplitting.
1269	1	a	Major fun especially on a HDTV with a controller. The game is so fun and the graphics are quite good for a game of this price. I'd definitely recommend this game. I'd like to see a sequel.
5964	1	a	Its a fun game to play when you need them dino kills :D
460	1	a	Very addictive I love it !
4998	0	a	I paid $20.00 USD, for this. Now it's $1.00 USD, I feel ripped off honestly. I bought the 4 pack. So this is not putting me in a happy mood. i'm glad I can buy it for friends now, but change your price back to twenty. Or are you just that cheap, like the Thai Hooker down the street! - Crimson Bolt.
3205	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with the starter pistol.  devs pls nerf starting pistol
3258	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
4485	1	a	OMG! BEST! GAME! EVER! totaly worth a 10/10
3187	1	a	Total of 30 min. 20 min searching/getting to a game.10 min of gameplay. Searching for a game was more fun. I somehow got this game for free.So im winning.
5758	1	a	Bought it for 0,49â¬, no regrets.  Have you ever felt the desire to fight unlimited waves of dinosaurs? Well, here you go!  Pretty basic horde gameplay that wears off pretty quickly but I mean, what are we to expect a lot from a game that was less than 1â¬?`  Great to play when you are extremely bored, downloading something or if you don't have access to the internet for a bit (kinda like a last resort)  11/10
6277	1	a	The only game on the market that combines the two best things in the world; Jetpacks and punching dinosaurs in the face!  10/10 - Get T-Rekt
1742	1	a	It's okay. It's a pretty good game to waste some time in when you're bored. 6/10
928	1	a	This game is worth all the money you'll ever put into hospital and electiricy bills.
6192	1	a	Such a great game and yet so simple. Not to mention the low price of 99 cents. This game brought me a few hours of fun and I highly recommend this game to anyone. Playing with friends is great and so is playing by yourself. Buy this game and you will not regret it.
4194	0	a	This game has some very nice maps though some of the things are too spread out....very nice objectives....and some not too bad models for things. Even the controls are not too bad....  The problems though.....wow....alot of them...going to slowly go down the list here.  Like int he game 'Killing Floor' the enemies simply go in straight lines try to get to things....like for example if you are playing the protect the genrator....they will go to the generator...no matter what like a homiing missile....only good thing is that the developers ont his game improved the engine a little bit...so unlike killing floor the enemies dont ignore up down physics.  If a player gets in a certain radius of any dinosaur....they become the next magnet...all enemies ignor everything else and go after that one player. The only time they lose interest is when the player goes into fight for their life mode.  Weapons....i dont know...they seam sub par.....they do barely any damage.....i was one shot killing by using the standard melee attack and because the AI was so bad.....i just had to stand in one spot....let the line of enemies come at me while i punched them all....didnt take much skill.  Grenades seamed to not work much at all and the grenades and my own gun fire seamed to be able to destroy the generator more then it could the enemies....and when i say grenades didnt work much...out of 20 being thrown, only 3 seamed to detonate...kind of annoying.  Another issue aside from the magnet enemy AI and poor performance weapons...my character always seamed super fragile...and my powers seamed kind of pathetic....like the assualt guy gets a jet pack....which is sort of neat yet any form of fall and you take massive damage....in real life i can jump of a 1 story building no problem...in this game such an act gets me badly hurt....yes i am inthe future with advanced armor and unable to survive very well...the irony does not escape me. The recon character class gets a very short sub-par cloak field....as in everything sees through it.....but then with the way the game auto tracks to you well guess thats just how it is.  Now when you die...you do get a fight for your life....which made me laugh alot....because as soon as you get to that state the dinosaurs ignore you and run off....and weirdly enough your weapons start doing even less damage. I had to melee 3 times instead of 1 time to kill things....that actualy made me laugh on the bad mechanic.  The game mode i played had a genrator i had to defend ala like a tower defense....waves of enemies would hsow up to assault that generator from all over. Each wave made enemies stronger and also would introduce new enemies. Between each wave i was given 60 seconds to spend cash i had recieved for killing enemies.  Ok first off the generators are always far away from the resupply points...you take 20 seconds to get to the those points even while sprinting....bad machanic....they should have made it so you can buy what what you want then maybe activate the generator to start the next wave....but no...the made a stupid way of doing it....ala like killing floor.  now each wave shows how many dinosaurs you have left to kill....these are shown with markers over them.....unfortunately anothe rbug makes more enmies appear inthe game who will randomly appear right be hind you or somewhere else and attack you.....again a flash back of killing floor and its poor game system.  Those random not needed to be killed enemies will appear right behind you...no matter where you are...inthe air...on a cliff....back to a wall.....suddenly you are getting hit....you turn around and see a dinosaur is on top of you and the wall and attacking only you.  I dont like games where they suddenly appear like that....with no defense....doesnt make this exciting...just makes it stupid.  Purchase of weapons requires alot of cash to get them...you wont be able to buy the next pistol untillyou have killed 10 enemies....you cant even by a rifle until you kill 30 of them.  My total time playing was maybe 10 or 15 minutes....why so little time to pass judgement....my game library on steam and raptr, and xbox live, and u-store...and a plethora of places speaks for it self.  I am biased...becasues i have played really good games and played really aweful ones...and this one although its not the worst....its still bottom of the barrel....i am surprised the meta-critic score is not lower. Persoanly i would rate this a 10 or 9 out of 100.  In my opinion the develoeprs failed bad onthe AI and the spawn on top of players mechanic. They failed on the run to the store to buy new stuff in 60 seconds mechanic...and they failed onthe cloak mechanic whihc doesnt seam to work.  Multiplayer death match following these mechanics simply will make the matches un balanced and no point to play...as it will follow the system the winner will get cash to buy new slughtering devices to kill faster and better while a person who is unlucky and loses to much will be left far behind.  I dont recommend this game to anyone in its present state....the being on sale for a dollar....well not sure if its worth the trouble to get it.   Pictures onthe site do a great job of showing its art work...game play though is not getting shown at all...they show movies....but no real game play...and the reason is becasue its not too good at all,
326	1	a	Boring too quick
1988	1	a	This is a very cool game.One item you get is he gravity gun (Half life 2 reference) and an oil gun.You travel around different worlds and shoot robots with the oil gun etc.
4270	1	a	Orion (insert subtitle here) is a super low budget crappy looking Halo ripoff that pits Master Chief look-a-likes against wave after wave of brainless angry dinosaurs that want to bite him to death.  Its not creative, deep, or original. It is a crude and simple game. And it is fun enough to be a guilty pleasure. The enjoyment doesn't last for long however, since Origin gets impossibly difficult a few waves in. For $1, you get what you pay for.  Its the ultra low quality attention to details that amuse me the most. I like how when most of the guns are fired, the recoil animation is the model's hands sliding up and down their forearms. Or how one of the character poses for holding the pistol is the same as holding a rifle.
5782	1	a	Honestly, at first I thought this game might be total crap since I played the alpha and that blew. As I've spent the last few nights playing this game I've come to love it. Survival mode is where its at.
1366	1	a	Shank is back and hes more dangerous then ever. Shank starts a few years after the first game. Hes on his way to see hes orphanage keeper but to find out shes taken away by army people. So Shank joins the resistance to fight against the army and get her back. This game is way better then the first one and is down right awesome. The game has tight controls which work smooth. The combat stay almost the same. You have new guns to youre arsenal like Molotovs, mines, throwing knive, sledgehammers and a bunch of weapons that youre fallen enemys drop. The game has some awesome boss fights which to get pretty epic and the cutscenes are awesome to look at because the art style is still amazing. The game is also hard as nails and some parts do get annoying. Also the survival mode is pretty fun. In it you play as a charecter of your choice and you have to protect three supply boxes while people try to destroy them. Overall the games is fun as hell and you really need to check out the whole franschie and i hope Klei make part 3 soon i give this game a 8.5/10
2471	1	a	This game much better than the metacritic rating it has recieved, I have only played this on multiplayer co-op but there is some fun to be had running around with your mates killing dinosaurs.
2155	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a FPS where you (primarily) defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10  Gameplay 6/10 I've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you. One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.  Graphics: 5/10 Looks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -&gt; horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.  Music/Sound: 4/10 I have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast. Sound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.  Performance: 4/10 The game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.
132	1	a	Nice take on an FPS tower defense. Worth playing just for the hilarious dialogue alone.
1580	0	a	Gets really boring really fast!
695	1	a	This game has one liners and orcs, I laugh my â¥â¥â¥ off every level.  Hwever, if you DON'T want a main character that quips every time he puts a trap down (Step right this way, mister orc.) or when you get a kill streak (Awwwwws, look who has no arms...) You'll probably hate it.
2510	1	a	You know, this game kind of sucks. BUT. I have had a ton of fun on it- I cannot lie. Haven't played anything but survival, so that's what I'm technically reviewing. Check it out. It's only $0.74 right now.
1365	1	a	This game should have been called Shank 2:The Real Chuck Norris simulator. After the events of first game Shank returns to his home village which he finds outruned by bad guys. And so another epic adventure begins for Shank. Shank 2 is a 2d side-scroller beat'em up game where you can kick some butt and break sculls of your enemies. Devastating arsenal of weapons including pistols chainsaws and ending with brutal sledgehammers. Game also introduces new 2 player coop survival mode which is actually fun and challenging. Awesome bosses fights, numerous goons to kill in different ways, and cool comic style landscapes. So everything is great here and it's full of badass-ery even though game is short but it's worth it low price. One of the best downloadeable games of 2012.

4259	0	a	This game is a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was gifted to me..so thank you for the gift...but my god....no...nononononononononono
3155	1	a	this game.. oh man.. this game is AWESOME. it's a nice little pearl.  At first view it may look quite bad, but give it a try in the PROPER manner and this game is super-addictive. The infos you will need to get the fun out of this game are a bit 'hidden', because no tutorial is going to show you, so you have to guess yourself or learn from other players.  For example, exping is SLOW if you just play on servers. solution? make a 'surival\conquest' &gt; 'pre-historic' lobby (or solo room) and set the parameters to get up until 1400% (or maybe more) exp multiplier! you can literally lvl up from lvl 0 to 40 in 40 mins if you keep a ~1000% multiplier.  There are many, many other tricks and strategies to be succesful on this game, but they will require you to play for more than 2-3 matches and experiment a little. (for istance: EMP granades can activate vehicles shop even if you disabled vehicles in a conquest match!)  Furthermore there are many game modes aside from coop. Unfortunately the servers are a bit empty! But if you start some good lobby players will eventually join.  Again, this game is fast, relentless, furious.... and it also comes bug-free (at least no big bugs), has a solid co-operative mode, cool weapons, cool maps, it's not P2W (the store is only cosmetic).  Futhermore the devs seem to be in love with their child and they take care of it. I suggest this title especially to players who liked Unreal Tournament (1997) cause it's that kind of GOOD.
6186	1	a	This is it to much FUN. I haven't played a game like this for awhile, i mean a Fantastic Joy. Before I wasn't too interested in the beginning with the concept of Dinosours. But in the End I gave it a try and it is a great price. It does feel like that they say it is Halo, and other FPS. Im hooked with this game Simple yet satisfying.
2880	1	a	I got this game out of the blue thanks to the steam sale. And if it wasn't for that I wouldn't of found it. This game is awesome period, its player movements are nice and smooth and the dinosaurs give the game a different feel. The weapons are great and nicely balanced so far. If this game goes on sale again I recommend buying it. Its a rather fun game to play.
5960	0	a	Cheap game, so can't complain. It does feel like it was developed by some people who got bored midway and still decided to release it.
3363	1	a	Pure dumb fun. I mean, how often do you come across a game where you get to use lighsabers and flamethrowers and mechs against dinosaurs? It is certainly worth the dollar.
2840	1	a	Great graphics and yet terrible graphics, but it is one of the most fun games to play with friends, up to 10 people at the same time.
1429	1	a	Not as good as the first game, but fine nevertheless. Beware: it's as hard as the first one. Even harder. :)
285	1	a	I definatley recommand this game and I hope u have extra cash cause your going to want part 2 after playing this!
4999	0	a	This game for me was too laggy. Can't join or play. Even if I could, the gameplay wasn't as fun as one may think. Sorry, but this game honestly isn't worth it.
4212	0	a	Even at a dollar this 'game' isn't worth it. Developers are shady, gameplay is ancient. Level design is a joke. Nothing is intuitive. This company deserves no support what so ever. They even turned off comments on their facebook. i want a refund.
315	1	a	This is the perfect game.  Demands both strategy and skill. Action packed, challenging and funny. 
787	1	a	Most of us have a collection of games that we bought for low prices and have never installed. I know I have probably two dozen. This was one of them until today. If it's one of your 'someday' games, change it. Now.
5437	0	a	it's cheap and it feels cheaper
711	1	a	Quirky, easy to play, fun for anyone tower defense game. KILL THEM ORCS!
369	0	a	This is a great, really fun game. Do yourself a favor though and get Orcs Must Die 2. It has everything this game has (including most the maps) and a whole lot more.
14	1	a	Best game ever. 10/10 thriving community.
1887	0	a	Has some of the worst level design I've ever seen.
1074	1	a	this game is like a tower defence on crack, its exstremely fast paced wilst most other TD allow you to take your time and think things out, this one gives you a chance to think out at the beginning but as soon as you start it you gotta run around and spend your points on the fly and it can make you panic at times, which is alot of fun at times
1711	1	a	Cute robot explores new worlds and has to solve small puzzles. Great little platformer! I really love the art and idea and wish this game had been little longer because I would wanted to see Beep in more adventures!
5108	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
5310	1	a	Must  Keep  Playng
755	1	a	It's like tower defense meets action RPG. Orcs Must Die! is quite fun.
1814	1	a	I got this when is was on discount so i dont mind if its good or bad. I played it and it was a pretty decent game. I played it in my spare time and stuff. You should buy it but there is 1 problem i had, In the loading screens it would most of the time crash.
6422	1	a	i dont remember playing it sooo...must be good
1148	1	a	This game is seriously addictive and very fun. If you enjoy tower defense games and always wished you could be down there to get that damn last straggler, this is your game. Tons of replay value, and quite funny to boot. Make sure you get the artifacts of power DLC though, that stuff is great!
2539	0	a	Okay, simply put...I hate this game. Horrible framerate. Bad controls. Annoying music.  Good thing I only bought this game from someone for 20 trading cards. I wouldn't have paid $15 for it.   I would rather play TF2 or Section 8 instead of this game.
1924	0	a	BEEP!   Best first person shooter series since Call of Duty.
5404	1	a	I have to say this game is pretty good for $1
409	1	a	It's a fast paced Dungeon Defenders with a little Sanctum mixed in. Reminds me of Dungeon Keepers (a really old game) where you get to make your own dungeons and set up traps. This has that same feel to it as you're essentially laying traps (some straight forward, others are interesting) and shooting/attacking the baddies before they make it to the end of the level. It's actually quite fun and I'd highly suggest to buy it even if you've already played DD and/or Sanctum a bunch. =3
6140	0	a	I am just dissapointed with Overkill. This is game is just bad. I loved the days of Dino Horde, but prelude is virtual trash. You downgraded us! Orion: Dino Horde was worth $15! Prelude isn't even worth $1. Also, I had 2 copies of Orion: Dino Horde in my inventory, and when it updated us to Prelude, they dissapeared. A sad, sad dissapointment.
5626	0	a	Bad and unoptimized!
2638	1	a	I really like this game. Totally worth the money, especially if you have friends to play with. The game is still sometimes rough around the edges. For example, the animations aren't as smooth as you expect them to be. Still one of the most fun I've had playing a game. Occasionally, you'll die from something dumb like being glitched into 2 dinosaurs, but I'm looking forward to the game being polished by their updates.
3979	1	a	Not only is this game the best of it's time, but its mechanics and gameplay is remarkable. The fact that it tells me to press 'E' and it does absolutely nothing causing me to die is a game feature that itself is a deal breaker. And the fact that it's a PC exclusive and not optimized for PC makes me leave this an 11/10
4634	0	a	Buggy, boring, and the same thing every level. Fun at first, but gets boring fast. Not worth the $1.  3/10
6412	1	a	Best 75 cents I've ever spent. I killed a pumpkin king!   p.s. it's way harder than it sounds.
1789	1	a	  Beep is a very fun game considering the price, it has good controls the level design is pretty decent in the way it works with the controls and what beep can do although this game is less than a pound and it can show at some points other than that beep is a fun game and is worth the money 7/10 p.s i just realised I said I got this for free I read the box wrong sorry about that
2625	1	a	so fun and addicting you upgrade and kill dinos! i judged it at first cause i thought it sucked but played and i loved it
5940	1	a	This game is like an Arcade Machine game except that you don't have to put a coin in everytime you want to play it.  When i bought this game, i wasn't really expecting much seeing its price tag, don't expect it to have BioShock Infinite graphics or something but it's still a really good game for $0.99!  Don't be fooled by the ''Hours played'' on my profile, i played alot offline.  PROS:  * Good buy menu, diversity of equipment, items and weapons * Multiplayer, duh * Objectives and missions, not only waves like in CoD zombies   CONS:  * Driving of the vehicles, it's not that good and you have to steer with your mouse. I don't really see any other cons.  So yeah, you should definetely buy this. 
2132	1	a	game made me hate pterodactyls  go hear for moor revew:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ceubiesreviews 
2942	1	a	This game somehow makes many old concepts work together and feel new and innovative. It's a whimsical kind of awesome; you can fly around with a motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing lightsaber fighting a T-Rex.
5234	1	a	Cant go wrong for only a dollar, easily the cheapest game on steam and it really isnt that bad, gets better with friends.

3310	1	a	Shootin dinos with broselfs is dope.
3569	1	a	The game may have bad reviews, how after a few updates it has become a much better game, I say this from the free play weeks not from owning, but the game is still rather enjoyable.
181	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a nice twist on the traditional tower defence genre. Instead of building towers to defeat creeps (orcs), you set traps along their path. The game is played in third person view, so you can also kill orcs with your own spells and weapons too (similarly to Sanctum). OMD is exactly what it says on the box. You kill orcs in hundreds of different ways as they make their way to the end of the level. The premise is simple and it's fun to work out various strategies to kill orcs. Items, weapons, spells and weavers (special abilities) can all be used. Some levels are frustrating, though a bit of logical thinking goes a long way. The visuals are very smooth and fit into the laid back, humourous style of the game. The storyline and voice acting are a bit cheesy, but OMD doesn't take itself too seriously, which adds to the charm. Great game to play casually.
235	1	a	Most fun I have had in a while. Consistant gameplay with little twists.
2394	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
6232	1	a	Tried to kill a dinosaur then it flung me into the air then I 360 noscoped it and entered a space ship. 10/10 IGN would play agian.
2953	1	a	First person shooter game sets in Dinosaur survival cooperative, big maps setting, survival mode waves with few objectives task to finish it. Killing dinosaurs to earn credits, you can buy upgrades, weapons or items. There a three class in this game, Assault, Support and Recon. The Assault has the ability to use his jetpack to easily escape from the dinosaurs as well going through unpassable obstacles. The Support has the ability to heal his teammates and also can heal himself and perhaps can act as a tank in the group, the last and finally. The Recon is my favorite class since the ability itself can cloak invinsibility to save herself in the trouble or revive her teammates, i also forgot to mention. There are alot of maps, game modes, etc.   I bought this game and i really enjoyed alot, even though there are minor bugs. They will always fixed the bugs and go for the updates, i highly appreciated of what the developers did because they listen to the community players. Take note that this is an Indie Game and its actually a small company who made this game. Some old low reviews came from Orion: Dino beatdown predecessor so there are lots of changes in the gameplay.  Rated: 8.7/10
590	1	a	I love this and the sequel. I love building, placing and managing the traps and seeing the mayhem happen and knowing where to assist the traps just constantly improving my 'dungeon'.
2311	1	a	I heard bad reviews coming into this game, but me and my friends ended up having an absolute blast playing it.
945	1	a	Awesome game! - Many fun hours spent =)
3332	1	a	Got it on sale, afked was like lucky to get a WHOLE set of foil cards. PROFIT MADE  10/10

Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material.

2315	1	a	If you're like me, you know the meta-score is the first impression of any game. If it's between 70-80 and above, it's worthe considering right?  Let me tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is a good game. Maybe not so much the $15...probably catch it on a sale (sorry devs, but it's a consumer opinion)   ORION is pretty damn fun. Really great shoot 'em up, an original concept, and although it has a bug once every 50 play throughs, it's stable. You know how you're on skype with friends and you're all trying to figure out a game to play because you're all bored? You scroll down your games list looking for games you guys both have and wanna play. Well lemme tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is always a game that we agree to.  Check it our, join in, be a part of the community, and shoot some dinos!
1301	1	a	This game is great. You run around, brutally dismembering the minions of the end boss, Magnus, through the use of your shanks, your heavy weapons (machetes, chainsaw, and sledge), ranged weapons (throwing knives, shotgun, and dual handguns), and explosives (grenades, molotovs, and landmines). The combat itself, regardless of weapon, is also immersive.  Also, you will die. A LOT.  In addition to the campaign, there's a survival mode where you need to work alone or with a partner to survive 30 waves of enemies by both not dying (a quite obvious aspect) and protecting three points on a small map from bombers, who put timed explosives on these points. There are many characters to unlock, including Shank's outfit from the first game.  This is an excellent game for those who like side-scrolling games.
4855	0	a	To simply put....Stay far away from this game if you have really, really poor server connectivity or a bad gaming rig or don't have a gaming CPU to begin with first off 7,000+ are playing this game and that's because they have GREAT server connectivty these dev's want you to create your own lobby and sit on your butt for about 2 hours or so until it's filled up but that will never happened do to a laggy, or buggy interface during finding online matches   I really want to love this game but the fact that it doesn't have it's own 'sever check program' and what that means is that the game if it has online mode should've checked the player's online/internet connections to see if his or her rig is up to playing and or connecting to a game or even play it for that matter the fact that it may cause spazzing during loading time and has the main menu glitched into the loading screen causing THAT to spazz out....what that really means basically is that the game 'can not connect to host'   If you don't have the patience to wait hours and hours on end for people to join your sever then don't play this game, delete it and play something else with better server connectivity and a very next to nill buggy interface.  Lastly two things:  1. Don't trust Metacritic because that review was from a different game honestly the game by checking out the screen shots feels like a 8/10 for some but for me? a 7/10   2.Don't trust the reviews by the gamers for this game what they failed to mention is that this game will be great to those who have a really, really good gaming rig with best online and internet connections and really, really bad to those who don't have a great gaming rig
5522	0	a	had fun shooting each other until we found that the software is very glitchy and has issues in most of the multiplayer modes. Fun for the right price.
6468	1	a	I bought this game back when it was considered the worst game on steam, which it was. But i still personally enjoyed it, and i recommended it to anyone who just wanted to blast some dinos.  Now, several years later and after loads of updates, the developers have really redeemed themselves. The developers listened to the community, and got to work despite all the hate they recieved. (My hat off to you devs.)  Now i can highly recommend this game to anyone who wishes a cheap, but fun game to play! This game isn't for everyone, ofcourse. But with all the different gamemodes, the good community and the chance to get eaten by a T-rex you're bound to have fun with it!
6023	1	a	A better game than it may at first appear, with a group of friends it can be a lot of fun fighting off the dinosaur hordes. On your own the game can be a bore but with the right people it shines.
3255	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with. Anyone that enjoys a good fps, whether it be pve or pvp should give this game a shot.
4732	0	a	this game is as bad as me being alive.
2040	1	a	A very nice game  relaxing
6076	1	a	Decent cheap game for those on a serious budget.
6438	1	a	this is what i say from 2013 the game was frekain terrbal dinosuares were going nuts palnes went in circels insted of stright and guns shot down inste dof up and u spawned upside msot of the times and the t-rex all ways sticked its tounge out when we rammed it with a plane which was funny now in 2015 cause i dint play it in 2 yrs it op........... lag is still a issue thoue oh well time to start re-palying old damn games that we all knew it was complete faliure
6036	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing don't let the reviews deter you.
224	1	a	Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.  4/5 One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!
2091	0	a	After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.  First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.  I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as 'The Worst Video Game EVER!' and 'Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?'. I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was 'the best turn-around in video game history!'. Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. 'It's Halo with Dinosaurs' they said, 'Nonsense!' I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed 'I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!'  So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?  What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.  The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.  Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.   EDIT:  In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game, but my recommendation stays the same.  To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself 'he can't be that bad'. Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?  This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. 'Can you still have fun with it?' Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.  There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.  You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.
3162	1	a	I don't really know how bad this was at launch, but right now? It's quite fun. It's essentially Killing Floor with a touch of Halo. Worth giving it a shot considering how deeply discounted it tends to be. Ignore the Metacritic score if you can, and ignore all the people who tease you for playing 'such a bad game' because â¥â¥â¥â¥ them, you're a grown up who can make judgment calls for yourself and are capable of enjoying life without worrying what other people think.
2165	1	a	A very underated game !
2822	1	a	so my reviews are along the lines of 'fu*k this game, 10/10' and this is no different. Wave defense, jetpacks, tanks and dinosaurs, what more could a guy ask for? you get to kill them? YES.    Fu*k this game. 20/10. Seriously.
2128	1	a	Plays game for 5 minutes.  Gets trapped in rock for ten minutes. Finally finds the teleport button. Hurrah! Run around dinosaurs with cryo knife taking advantage of their slow turning. Cryo blade a T-Rex and a Triceratops to death. Gets killed by a small and insignificant dinosaur. 10/10 would play again.  
3153	0	a	Too expansive for 0,49 cents. Horrible, and isn't shiny. :&lt;
1506	0	a	This game's puzzle mechanics are satisfying. They're definitely unique, especially since a preferred playstyle can be chosen. You can stealthily get around by means of trickery and concealment by creating fake copies of things and swapping around the locations of objects, people and yourself. On the other hand, you can find creative ways to use your powers to waltz on out of every guarded room without leaving anything recognizable as human behind you. You can also blend a very functional gradient between the two. There's plenty of variation in the enemies' appearances and behaviors, not to mention humorous dialogue.  Where the game comes short isn't really a single issue. In general, it feels watered down. It's a great game in concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Puzzles lack variation. The art is nice, but it gets monotonous to walk through the same hallway for the umpteenth time. The aforementioned playstyles are enjoyable, but they're not flexible; upgrades are irreversible. To mitigate this, you'll have to backtrack and hunt for the currency used to purchase the upgrades, which, admittedly, can lead to some of the most enjoyable puzzles.  Essentially, the concepts offered potential that was untouched. The game feels incomplete in important aspects of gameplay. Many puzzles are bland, repetitive, or unchallenging. The gameplay is somewhat incompatible with the physics engine used, allowing exploits that get you to higher elevations than you should be able to get to. The game's length is short. Overall, it feels underwhelming. I really do think that this game's core mechanics are far from lacking, but it's the nuances that overshadow the parts that would otherwise shine.  TL;DR: While mechanics are creative and enjoyable, the presentation is trite and disappointing.
712	1	a	An excellent game for a reasonnabnle price ! Jump into this action tower defense with loads of fun !
2946	0	a	Here is what we have learned from this game: Dinosaurs and Killing Floor do not mix. At all. They just don't. The people who think this game is good are lying to themselves. If you check the public multiplayer servers, there are many. Many barren, unused servers. It took one try for my friends to find the game that I had joined through the server list. That is not what I want in the game. Neither is a dinosaur Killing Floor knockoff. I guess that's what I asked for when I bought this game for a dollar. Yeah, don't buy it. Save your dollar.
6234	0	a	So after a lengthy debate with friends about this game, we came up with a fairly accurate description for it. Yes, with a few friends it can be fun for a limited time, but so can having syphilis. Then after a while you realize how bad it really is and wish you hadn't paid the money to get this horrible disease, and even with the help of friends its unbearably painful.
3640	1	a	This game is much beteer than it's predecessor.I love it.
1476	1	a	Lots of action, classic story and BRUTALITY.
1997	1	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is actually pretty noice
3495	1	a	This game fondled me greately. With such beautiful graphics and a compelling storyline how can you not have fun with it?  Definately worth the Â£1 i spent on it and I would go as far as to say I feel like I ripped off the creators! 10/9 what a steal indeed
455	1	a	Very fun game, simple but great visuals. Tower defence-ish but with an 'in the field' style gameplay makes the challenge in running around to different areas of the map on foot to lay down traps as well as taking on the fight yourself with the orc horde. Very addicting with short levels that just keep comming one after another. Traps are varied as are the enemy types, fun to be had by all.
683	1	a	You like orcs? Plenty of them! You hate orcs? What are you waiting for, slaughter them!
470	1	a	Better than tower wars!
2962	1	a	I felt like Boba Fett, but except for rebel scum, I was killing dino scum 10/10
5573	0	a	This game might be good if you didn't freeze everytime you turned ,but it seems good
4496	0	a	this is the worst game ever I paid for it and the grafics are bad most of the game is noobs the worst thing there is no planes or tanks 
3299	1	a	Shoot dinos in the face!
2563	1	a	Many reviews say this is a bad game, I disagree. The gunplay feels good, the graphics are very good, the maps are nice and the gameplay is fun.  I haven't seen many bugs at all, it seemed a fairly seamless gameplay experience.
1241	1	a	A hidden gem on Steam. Definitely worth the 4 bucks I paid to play it.
4280	1	a	A glitchy buggy mess of game with broken ai and Laggy hitboxes. They were smart to make their tagline 'It's only 99 cents!' And to their credit... It is only 99 cents.
593	1	a	Only bought this due to being cheap... would have paid full price. Super addicting
6252	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends, i hate those stupid tiny dinos tho xD
2983	1	a	Beatdown, beat em up, killem good!. Just watch the skies for the god darn TERRIES! May you jetpack in peace.
4164	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
207	1	a	Got to love this game. Tower defense, FPS, Story progression, hilarious... This game has it all. This is a great goto game when you have a few mins to kill.
5213	0	a	Well... it's not bad... but... it's not good as well
4008	1	a	Hell yes. This game is awesome. Reminds me of the wildly inventive mods of the early 2000s.
5730	0	a	wtf i buy game and frre to play  
4462	1	a	One of the best dinosaur games I have played in a long while. I would have happily paid around $5 for a game like this.  Pros -It is a steal for 99 cents! Far better than any 99 cent iphone game - It has dinosaurs! -Every battle take part in seems unique, anything can happen! -It is moderately open world -Contols are easy to use -those particle effects! -any multiplayer game mode you can think of -Hats, hats and more hats -it can run on anything if you know how to adjust your system settings and the game initialization file  Cons -the game can be a bit buggy and has lots of random FPS drops even on my gaming rig - The Ai dinosaurs can be a little goofy at times. - No single player campaign (I got over that since the game was apparently made by 2 people and I don't want to put to much pressure on the devs,) -The maps are all very similar in style and design. -the 3D characters, guns, props and textures are not as high quality as i would like. (still very good though!) -its not as realistic as crysis 3 (Get over it) -I felt that the devs could have taken this game just a little bit further to make it trully amazing  Awesome dinosaur game,  good multiplayer indie game   Rating: 8.7/10  
4101	1	a	Not even gonna bother reviewing it. 80 cents for this game is great. You got dinos and guns and pew pew pew and stuff. Just buy it.
6222	0	a	I do not recamend this game because its more of a one play only game then its boring, graphics are a no, multiplayer is a no, not that fun for me, mostly because I have a very fast very open cp and its very slow.
1482	1	a	You warp into people and turn them into blood geysers, is there anything more to say? Good atmosphere, nice sounds, good looking animations. Unfortunately this is pretty much a direct 360 port so the controls are not as tight as they should be unless you have a 360 pad, there are no video setting outside of resolution and vsync, no mouse usage, and mixed control prompts. It's a shame about the lack of graphics options because this game could go from nice looking to gorgeous with ease. Overall the mechanics,unique, well executed, and so much fun it is well worth the full price and a steal when on sale.
6354	1	a	Its 'Great' for a 1$ game,Pffffff there are skins in cs:go and wepons in tf2 that cost MUCH more than this game.
4400	1	a	ORION: Dino Hore is a action packed RPG MMO with robots. It is a forth person shooter with many different guns to choose from including, My favourite, the pistol. The Graphics are revolutionary for the dinosaws moths move and even when you die you get a very good insight of what a dinosaws digestive system looks like there for it is also educational. You can play many classes such as the mage, the rouge and soldier or even the random guy who does not do anything and still win by pure luke. Now i know what you fink, Meta score ist bud but screw the sustem. What the lego movie taught me, dont trust the government for they give you false information 99999999% of the time. I give this game a 11111111111111111111111111/1 in my opinon. The specil ting bout dis gam is you can play as a dinosaw which everybody wanted. Overal, ds gam is gut and i prefer th tim i cilled a dinosaw but relized it was my friend with a hat on. 
476	1	a	This game is really fun! You start of with a funny intro comic thing giving you the story, and from then on it's orc slaying action! You unlock more traps with every level you beat resulting in more fun ways to kill the orcs! This game is a must have! 10/10
3279	1	a	This game is much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
151	1	a	Better than i thought it would be. 10/10

6254	1	a	mostly unlrealistic weapons + 50% cartoonish gameplay + no blood = great for kids who want a shooter game  8/10  10/10
5305	0	a	This is easily one of the worst games i have ever played. The game looks and plays like trash and the developers are disingenuous pigs. DO NOT GIVE THESE MEN MONEY.
1234	1	a	Fun little game. Easy to pick up and just play. Snag it if its on sale.
2126	1	a	The name will have probably changed by the time I post this, but Super Mega Dinosaur Slaughter Adventure: Space Explorers is not that bad of a game. It's 99 cents, and, while certainly bad, its fun to play. If you have a dollar thats burning in your pocket I'd suggest picking this up
5670	0	a	Asset stealing at it's finest
4582	0	a	loaded up game, game crashed 10/10
4593	0	a	'Incredible visuals and addictive combat.' Hmm, is it possible to file a lawsuit due to false advertising?
2589	1	a	This game is really awsome its totally worth it!
5838	1	a	If you've ever wanted a cheap, fun, multiplayer wave survival game to play with friends, this is it. It has some quirks to learn, and it's no AAA title, but my friends and I have gotten about 25 hours out of it so far, and we consider it well worth what we paid for it.
5520	0	a	HUH this says single player. I booted it once and only saw multiplayer. I can't play multiplayer games. Whats the deal?
5595	0	a	bad graphics old game expected it to run fast on my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ laptop and it doesnt 1/10 dont reccomend cant even run on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ laptops
1035	1	a	It's really fun, definitely worth playing.
4683	0	a	its still pretty bad
4623	1	a	A little buggy , glitchy and of course WTF Game , but for 1â¬ its just amazing with lotta game modes , Dinosaurs and that meh things . BUT! yes , There is BUT! If u have a slow Connection DONT BUY THIS GAME !
1280	1	a	Very nice co-op. Was a bit shame that it was only for 2-players but still... funny game. Maybe wouldn''t play singe player though.
744	1	a	Orky Orky times! = Fun times!

232	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
5203	0	a	Total waste of money, i could feed a whole african village with that 1$. The game runs like complete **** and looks like a bad version of halo and borderlands together.
4925	1	a	i played it... But, The Animations of the Dinosaurs and the People are sucky. cool and awesome graphics though! R-Really Awesome Grapics!
3487	1	a	Mad, Frantic, Buggy, AWESOME. This game has got it all. Punch a raptor in the face. Done. Get eaten by T-Rex. Done. Get carried away by a Pteradon. Done. A crazy game who's charm far outweighs it's buggy nature. Great fun to play survival. PVP is not the best but you be the judge. Check it out.
2227	1	a	After reading the reviews, I bought this game thinking I would get a few lolz with 3 friends for 3 euros. After playing for a while, I have to say that this game is ridiculous and looks funny, but it is also absolutely fun and awesome.  Animations look weird, graphics are dated and some illustration are hilarious in a kitsch way. It can be confusing too and doesn't make much sense. But as long as you don't take the game seriously it's surprisingly fun. Just try it if you can without expecting too much. It does a very good job at making you forget its flaw.
2684	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is a wonderful 'MURDER EVERYTHING' game, with great graphics, gameplay, and content. It has a variety of weapons, vehicles, and gamemodes. You could be shooting dinosaurs with energy lasers, or alternatively shooting players with energy lasers. Now, for most of the review there'll be content on Dinosurvival. This is because it's the main point of Prelude, but there are other games too. CTF is almost never played. If you want to play CTF, you might want to go somewhere else. Not saying CTF is bad on Prelude, just that nobody ever opens a server for it. You'll usually find the official servers are all Dinosurvival, with a few unofficial ones sportying different gamemodes, such as Gun Game or Team Deathmatch. I, myself, have never played TDM or Gun Game on Prelude, prefering the Dinosaur Shooting Madness known as Dinosurvival, in which you murder dinosaurs with Gatling Guns, Flamethrowing Turrets, and Helicopters.  Most of the time, the players are nice, friendly, and concentrated on the game. But once in about every 50 games, you'll get someone who hoards all the good vehicles without doing anything to help murder all dinosaurs you see. It's also very good for a cheap game, coming in at a CS:GO case key for 4 copies. (Â£1.69) Think of how much more content you and your friends are getting for your money when you bought a 4-Pack of this game instead of a case key for CS:GO. TLDR: A MURDER EVERYTHING game with a good playerbase and populated servers but some servers overlook gamemodes that probably would be good. 9.8/10
1810	1	a	Small n1 platfor game :)  
4120	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
3256	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
4463	0	a	i played one match and thats good enough for me i had glitches every room i walked in i had teammates that just stood there when i was down and had no fun
660	1	a	This is one of the best action tower defence games I have played. really fun traps and combos and freedom to run around fighting makes this a nice gem. lack of multiplayer or co-op is the only bad thing, but even solo is still alot of fun
1320	1	a	This is a fun game as well, finished the 1st game a couple of days ago, gotta say this sequal adds for the Combat and follows the story, it plays well with a gamepad, used a X360 controller, also works with a K&amp;M, but you might not be comfortable K&amp;M. I found no matchs online, its ok, asI played it a while back, and it was fun. If you have a friend to play the game with, i suggest you play MP. It supports both local and online MP. So you can play MP localy with K&amp;M + Controller.
2596	1	a	An amazing game, especially for the low cost. A good game of dino survival with a few friends and you can't go wrong.
2915	1	a	If you have buddies its alot of fun and a good time. but i wouldent recomend it to solo players. 
4546	1	a	This game is the reason I wake up in the morning.   Acid shooting dino/10
2824	1	a	GET a group of friends All get this game HAVE A BRILLIANT TIME
5549	0	a	How am I able to write a review for a game I never played?? 0/10!
1084	1	a	Leave those poor orcs alone damn it !
890	1	a	This is an awesome game. And this is coming from someone who despises tower defense games.
4468	1	a	I think that despite the criticism that orion prelude has been given I think it is a very solid game... for only ONE dollar. Its so cheap that it doesnt have to be good but they still made it decent. It is a vey fun arcade shooter and I would say it is the most casual out of the three dinosaur shooters that I own. Its a great game to buy a friend who has naver used steam perhaps and is multiplayer so you can play together. It is very satisfying to kill large hoards of dinosaurs. Personally I would have liked to see a few more guns as well as bigger differces between the character classes that you can choose. It is also too easy to camp because of the jetpack although there is a brid that will sometimes pull you off your camp spot after a while. Lastly there are not so many servers for the vast number of gamemodes that the devs have created.  Pros: -fun arcade shooter -cheap -decent graphics -good game balance -many dinosaurs -many gamemodes -good powerups -multiplayer (you can make your own lobby)  Cons: -repetetive after a certain amount of rounds -some glitches -maps are sometimes too easy to defend -few guns -classes dont do much -after upgrading guns and armour ect the game can become unbalanced -Should be different types of bosses in harder levels, not just more of them   
2791	1	a	The metascore may leads to misunderstandings. It's not a very good game but at least not bad. i play in a lobby and it's really fun. it's exciting and some kind of interesting but still lots of problems  such as this game has the worst music ive ever heard and this game need more test. Anyway highly recommend if it is on 1 usd again.
1432	1	a	The original Shank and Shank 2 are fundamentally the same game. You will be doing the same combos with the same weapons on the same enemies.   They did add some fun tidbits such as weapons enemies drop that you can then pick up and beat other enemies with. Some of those weapons are insanely powerfull which only adds to the fun. However, I did not find myself using most of weaker pickups because the gameâs balance was more focused on Shankâs default weapons so you cannot combo as well or as quick.  Bosses are considerably more enjoyable than the original Shank. While they are fundamentally repetitive, they feel challenging. Add that to the bosses are no longer tanking you with their health pool and you have a very enjoyable experience that will leave you screaming at your screen with excitement.  Another definite positive is enemy animations. Though it might be unimportant to game play, it defiantly adds to atmosphere. After a brutally insane and satisfying combo, it is fun to watch your beaten enemies roll around on fire or with limbs missing.  However the biggest negative is the story. If the story was bad in the first Shank, it is even worse in Shank 2. The story seems to have no point what so ever and you will find yourself wishing it was not there. The ability to skip cut scenes is the greatest thing I could hope for while playing Shank 2.
4923	1	a	Good fun with friends, though there are some annoying bugs every so often, it can still be enjoyable.  Got kinda boring though.
6118	1	a	really good gameplay the dinausors bug and fly in the sky from time to time but apart from that i really recomend it and its almost free
2518	1	a	Worth every penny!
1972	1	a	I really was surprised with this game. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Beep has a very good character, and decent difficulty as you get to the later levels. I picked it up for only .19 cents, but I would say it can be worth the full price of only $5 as it is very fun, and I haven't even finished everything there is yet.   I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of side scrolling platformers with a little bit of puzzling, and collection =P    First Impressions Video   
4828	0	a	Barely playable.
1150	1	a	Fun, but has DLC...so I'd give it 6/10
3825	0	a	The gameplay is boring. In the PvE mode dinosaurs differ mostly by size and HP amount. Their AI is closer to Space Invaders. Real dinos were smarter than that. The guns are uninspiring and gunplay doesn't deliver.  Looks like something from 2003 with some effects such as motion blur and depth of field slapped on to mask the ugliness.  Wouldn't play even if I was paid to.   If you want a good co-op game look at Payday 2, Left for Dead 2 or maybe Killing Floor.
3462	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
4524	1	a	This game is LOADS of fun its like a combonation of Halo and Jurassic Park!
748	1	a	A very fun and satisfying tower defense / shooter type game. You have an array of traps and some basic spells to choose from to slice, burn, crush, and explode the Orcs from entering the Rift. Sounds are excellent to make you feel like you are actually doing damage and the visuals aren't the best but still pretty awesome. Tons of voice acting to keep you smiling. There are plenty of Tower Defense / Shooter types out there, but this is the most satisfying one yet.
4902	1	a	Get it on sell I bought a 4 pack for $3 me and friends love it so much
6266	1	a	This game is quite fun in spite of it's self. During it's development history it has had a lot of ups and downs but in it's current state (v 2.1 as of this writing) it's game play is well worth the sub-$10 price.  It has a lot of sharp corners consisting of bugs and poor design concepts, yet the appeal remains for me. Hopefully a few more bug patches will ship for this before it's completely abandoned en leue of indie dev's next project.
3163	1	a	nice nut a bit Laggy :/ 
3689	1	a	  Dinos, explosives and robot suits. What's not to love!   [The good]:   - Pretty much everything is balanced. The guns, the creatures, the vehicles. Nothing is overpowered to the point of being gamebreaking.   - Map detail is really pretty. A bit like Rust on low-graphics or Firefall. And the texture models for the dinos are quite realistic.   - Literally just about every weapon and vehicle you could imagine. Sniper rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, smgs of all sizes, heavy MG's, bows, melee weapons, mech suits, tanks, ATV's, assault aircraft. If you can imagine it, this game has it.   - Everything is nicely porportioned. Distances between objectives and timings between waves of dinos are quite fair but not tedious.   - The weather. Probably my favorite thing about the game. Realistic rain is almost impossible to find. The drops actually fog up your visor and add a small but amazing touch.   [The not-so-good]  - Animations. Though the artworks is pretty and all, its not uncommon to see both dino and human models with their limbs contorted at unnatural angles.   - Clipping. Suffice to say, its possible to get stuck inside a dino or a rock.   - Optimization/latency. Random ping spikes ^300+ from a ~80 avg. Random fps drops to &lt;20 previously running at ~50 avg. If you die while inside a creature, after respawning your weapons will sometimes not fire.   - Map design. Looks aren't everything. In terms of playability the 4 maps I played on had fairly dull gameplay. Mostly flat/hill terrain. Little to no high ground for snipers. Too narrow of an area for vehicles to do work, yet too wide for explosives to be effective.  - Hitreg. Even perfectly placed shots will not do damage and shots that really shouldn't hit, do.   - Economy. While the weapons themselves are balanced, the prices really arent. On medium servers, there are ~13 waves of dinos. Assuming you kill 50% of the wave, you're going to spend more than half of the game grinding up to buying some semi-decent weapon other than a starting pistol. (protip, always go for the c9 revolver if you cant afford a good rifle. its a 2 tap headshot and deadly accurate for a reasonable price)   - Drops/loot. Mainly the fact there is none. It'd be nice to have the occasional airdrop of ammo packs or something. Having to rebuy ammo every round is really tedious.   All in all, its a really fun game and worth the price. The devs could do a few things too improve it but as it stands it's totally worth the price.   Full disclosure, I did get the game for free.
754	1	a	Nothing beats watching the stupid greenskins fall into your traps of doom.
3561	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played and i suggest getting it. 
2166	1	a	It isn't great but you'll get 10-20 hours out of it for next to no money (less than Â£1 is a fair price for what you get).  Make sure to bring a few friends and try and save for the flying tank thing.
1708	1	a	BEEP is always on a high level like each triple-A title. It has a awesome main menu which feels like kerbal space program just in 2D, like minecraft and terraria. The game itself is feels like a Super Mario game just with guns, big guns and explosions and a lot of action. The story isn't so good as i thought, but it's definitely on the same level of quality as the assassins creed series or even the battlefield series.  11/10 would accept gift again 
3405	1	a	This is one of the greatest steals on steam. For the money you would spend on a 2-liter you can have hours of dino-shooting-madness with 3 friends.

Why is this on steam for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake .
410	1	a	I played this game through in fifteen hours. That's a bit short, but every hour was good fun. Definitely one of the most fun tower defense games I've tried.
0	1	a	First non-Valve game on Steam. Bought it when it came out, the dedicated MP servers are long gone but it's worth a play co-op, single player or tunngle/hamachi multiplayer.. worth it just for the cutscenes, theme song and style.. p.s. you can edit the theme song too, change the channels, levels, pitch etc.. funky.
1233	1	a	Pretty much a 3d version of those 2d flash games where you upgrade and progress through endless waves of killing â¥â¥â¥â¥. It also has some strategic challenges, so its fun to play on a rainy day
3133	1	a	Just buy it.You won't regret it!
1562	0	a	I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with the term 'tower defense'. It's a game where you build and upgrade towers to defeat waves of enemies and, later on, bosses trying to destroy your [insert something random here like a base or village]. If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Somehow I do enjoy playing them, even though most of them are simply clones. This one is ok I guess. Graphics are nothing special and it does what it's supposed to do. However, there are definitely better tower defense games around, so get this one if you've played through all the others.  [Rating: 60/100]
5019	1	a	Nice game
991	1	a	A fun tower-defense/third-person-action game. The story is just a vehicle for funny voice overs and different maps, but the gameplay is great.
2629	1	a	somebody clean up my â¥â¥â¥
4323	0	a	This is one of those awkwardly medicore games. Even their options menu is clunky (with typos). With resolutions that are a bit off (especially if you show windowed). Hell, you can't even turn off things like head bob, so even your human bobs his head like he has a two foot neck (great for headaches). The combat has the awkward down with the dinos twitching around as they run half sideways as their attack.   Funny enough it even has a store to buy 'Spiral Coins' from, which is impressive for a non-F2P game. Though they seem to be putting a lot of updates in, so they probably are working for it.  I picked up a 4 pack on sale, just because even a bad game can be amusing on co-op. So I really wanted to like it, but it looks like I'll just keep those for gag gifts.
337	1	a	Incredibly stress relieving fun. Build â¥â¥â¥â¥, kill orcs. Cest tous. :-)
5556	0	a	This is a massively awful game. Don't even think about picking it up.
3094	1	a	Pretty sure this is the most fun I have had with a $1 game. Buy it.
1939	1	a	Better open-world exploration than Skyrim
5999	1	a	Ok, so: Automatic weapons? Check. Jetpacks? Check. Dinosaurs? .....DOUBLE CHECK!  This game is WAY fun! I'm not sure how anyone is finding this boring. YOU FLY AROUND ON JETPACKS AND SHOOT DINOSAURS WITH SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY.  'Nuff said. If you don't own this, you're wrong.
311	1	a	Really fun game, well worth the money paid for.
3630	1	a	Fun to Play with friends
6072	1	a	I only recommend this game if you get it for less than $1. I'd be very unhappy if I paid full price for this game. Quite repetitive, you'll pretty much play through every map a few times in a few hours and get bored.
1912	0	a	i only got this for the free $10 game.
4894	1	a	holy cow the uninstall button really works best 1 dollar ive ever spent 
802	1	a	Fantastic game for playing solo, if you want co op then go for the Orcs must die 2
4595	0	a	The single and only shitest most unbalanced laggy peice of crap that I love for no reason. Now I'm off to uninstall.
5302	1	a	Dear Developers [clears throat]  Make this game free,Just for the banter.  
1835	1	a	Better than War thunder
4369	1	a	7/10
6214	1	a	Cover this BabaKiueria. Seriously though the voice acting alone is enough to get this.
4168	1	a	One heck of a game if you start playing it ,hard to stop. Cuz so much fun ^^
6004	0	a	Graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. The gameplay is â¥â¥â¥â¥. The sound makes me want to cry. The recoil on some of the weapons are trash. Even if it's only one dollar, I would rather have the 4 gumballs that could buy me.
5794	1	a	Awesome game.... its an incomplete game but a lot of fun with friends and good time pass for a $1 you can't more than that...Recommended if you are bored playing FPS games and want to try out some jurrasic park kinda game  8/10
1611	1	a	An excellent quick, cheap Tower Defense game. Really enjoyed it.
2466	1	a	STEP ASIDE DINO D DAY FOR A NEW DINO GAME HAS COME FOURTH! FOR ALL OF YOU THAT LIKE A 99CENT GAME WITH UNPOPULATED SERVERS AND â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOS THEN BUY IT FULL PRICE, EAT ME, #DINO4LIFE#ALMOSTASGOODASPEGGLE  #YALLBETRIPPIN
6281	1	a	This game is the best cant wait to get started again 
2745	1	a	I got stuck in a rock. 10/10 I will get stuck again.
2475	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
5582	1	a	Great Game,Cheaper Than Minecraft ! (Premium Account) 10/10 Would Buy ! :)
240	1	a	Great game.
1617	1	a	It's a where the f*** do I go kind of game. But a man,a good one at that.The game doesn't hold your hand,it requires certain level of skill,you need to save often otherwise you'll end up replaying the whole level (20 mins+).It requires playing around with the files to get it running at 1080p as it usually does with old games,but it's not impossible to do.  But the multiplayer...oh my god...It's....AMAZING. Especially the servers where you've got all the powerups at max and only lightsabers are allowed.You can't just 'Mash X' to kill an enemy,you need careful planning,you need to use your powers as well as lightsaber and movement to take down an enemy player.All it takes is 1 lightsaber hit.  If you're expecting something along the lines of 'Force unleashed' ,then you'll be dissapointed.On the other hand,if you've played JEDI Academy,and you liked it,you'll enjoy this game as well.  8/10 (The navigation really is a pain in the bum)
40	0	a	A pretty unique concept but another of the worst games I've ever played. First boss of the tutorial is too overpowered and I can't beat him no matter what I do. There's better things out there to play. I'm done with this frustrating and stupefying game.
1460	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
6413	1	a	Eh, it's fine. Fun first or third person dinosaur shooting. There is also a deathmatch mode, the respawn times get a little frustrating though. It'll run on lower end systems too.   Just remember to heal your teammates instead of driving over them like a chode.
1475	1	a	You really can't beat this game for the price. So much fun with a friend!
2676	1	a	Me and my friends had a blast its halo vs dino amazing
4642	1	a	A little laggy and unresponsive, but probably because I barely meet the minimum pc requirements. Great from what I've seen. More than worth the dollar I paid for it.
1880	1	a	For $.19, not a bad game.
2813	0	a	This game is the love child of nazi-zombies and borderlands, except this child has an extra chromosome.
5664	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥...
2587	1	a	Brief: An extremely underrated dinosaur survival game well worth the small cost.  Pros: +GRATUITIOUS DINOSAURS! +Play as a dino or a human +Bots for offline play +Various game modes +'Avatar' style vehicles +Various weapons/cosmetics +Decent graphics with nice effects +Skill tree per match +Endless survival mode (or maybe I'm just too rubbish to reach the end)  Cons: -Gameplay gets a little stale after a while
4833	0	a	Just, not finished game...
399	0	a	buy number orcs must die 2 if you want to join friends
1184	1	a	A ton of fun and so much satisfaction after a Victory! Not very difficult. The hardest Wave is mostly the first. But still challenging with a Nightmare Mode I haven't tested yet.
4788	0	a	I played 16 minutes of this game and i hated it. The game is very slow and laggy and yet I feel like even though that it is free, I still feel like I want a refund for wasting those 16 minutes of my life. 0/10 would never play again.
4864	1	a	Too little time played, but I sure did enjoy what I have played. Don't mind any issues in the slightest, other than the disconnection my net caused. gunplay is fun, killing dnos = fun, price? not an issue in the slightest. 'Tis a must play with friends.
3194	1	a	Fight for Egg-Based Dominance in a world of marines fighting for Egg-Based Dominance and Dinosaurs who conveniently are also fighting for Egg-Based Dominance.
3830	1	a	Only $0.99 to kill dinosaurs? Amazing. 11/10
5646	0	a	Pile of wank
5635	0	a	These graphics are so garbage that it isn't even worth 1 mere cent. Let alone one dollar. 2012 game my â¥â¥â¥.
2666	1	a	OH yes it is the most fantastic game on the planet. Even the Stig has something to say abou â¥â¥â¥ and i quote, 'It's real good.'
6227	1	a	This game is 79p...79P! If you haven't bought it, just do it! IT's a great game.
3874	1	a	Teabagged a dead T-Rex on slow motion with an helicopter.  9/11 GOTY
1425	1	a	Combo potentional bonanza, loved this game, shank 3 please!
6089	1	a	Pretty good
79	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
4282	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a great game that i got for only Â£0.99!!!! i was amazed at how good it was as i had never heard of it before, it has a great singleplayer and multiplayer experience and the graphics are phenominal!!! 100% must buy!!!!
5951	1	a	Nice graphics good team playing game like tf2 but instead of player enemys its dinosaurs!!!
3962	0	a	Launched it 2 times. 2 crashes in a row. 10/10 Auto-delete.
3835	0	a	I unknowingly killed a dev and insulted the game in their face. I felt pretty guilty but then I thought, 'this game is so terrible adding Bubsy into it would make it better.'
4517	0	a	Game sucks
4829	0	a	this game is very annoying everytime i try to play theres a computer type person who circles me the entire time i try to play. very annoying!!!
4436	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
1584	1	a	The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
3169	1	a	$0.49 USD thats all :D

5602	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
3270	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun!
2959	1	a	I got an achievement for being eaten. 10/10
5526	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.
5358	1	a	top notch!!!
1284	1	a	If Gatling Gears didn't require the absurd Origin login and require an internet connection every time you try to boot up the singleplayer game, I would probably more highly recommend this game. It's a hell of a lot of fun if you're a fan of any modern twin stick shooter and it really challenges you early on. If you can look past the terrible DRM, you'll have a lot of fun with this one.
731	1	a	there is only one word to describe this game..... AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
5720	0	a	Laggiest, game ever!!!!! WIsh I never had it
5636	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
4200	1	a	I'm almost ashamed to say that this game is stupidly awesome. It's HALO crossed with Jurassic Park. Co-op play is really fun.  Dozens of weapons, ability upgrades, maps. Lots of game modes including PvE, PvP, PvPvE. You can even play as a dinosaur and eat your friends. Custom (Prehistoric) difficulty is where it's at. There are vehicles, explosions, jetpacks and much, much more.  The persistent leveling system unlocks permanent bonuses; if you ever get the itch to feel like a complete badass, this game is for you.  The best $1 you will ever spend. Just do it.
2149	1	a	I don't even own the game but yeah.
3373	1	a	I get it. You're looking at the Metacritic and going '36?!'  This is a SOLID game. It reminds me of Halo's horde mode. There's vehicles, jetpacks, perks, and giant dinos trying to eat you alive.  Many times, a game that is garbage is released and left to die. Not these guys. They kept working. After 2 years, they finally have the game that they promised.   http://artistryingames.com/spiraling-control-incredible-journey-spiral-game-studios/ 
108	0	a	It's a poker game, mixed with an rpg element. Pretty shallow. Difficulty scaling is pretty messed up?
529	1	a	Frantic, hectic fun. Nothing is more fun than watching you trap layout eat up orcs like a well oiled machine. Oiled with Blood.
5185	0	a	only played it for about 20min before i deleted it. bad level desgin bad game play. only good thing was the graphics. it was 0.99 but even if it was free i'd ask for a refund
3737	0	a	I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout 'rad'. A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.  I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck.   That's what playing ORION: Dino Horde felt like.
1106	1	a	i got this for 3â¬ and spend 40 hours of tactical orc slashing, optimizing my trap arrangement. it's fun, buy it. if you like tower defense, this is what you want.
5416	0	a	My friend got the four pack of this, we played for a few minutes, quit, never played again
48	1	a	The most bad â¥â¥â¥ poker game around. With great music/graphics and gameplay...this game will make you pumped to play poker. Simply awesome.
449	1	a	Good stuff, well worth the money and a lot of fun. A new spin on tower defense.
2717	1	a	Maybe this is a buggy game... but for 0,99$ ist really good and can give you 100 hours of fun :D
505	1	a	I got this on a whim a few weeks back. It's one of the best tower defense games that I have ever played, hands down. Great voice acting. Humorous story. Tight controls. Excellent gameplay. A worthy addition to any steam library.
4451	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
1092	1	a	Great tower defense game with lots of action.
443	1	a	Fun game to play in between the deeper games. I would NOT pay $15 for it. Pick it up if it is on sale.
4842	1	a	This game is one of the worst games I've ever played. The only two good things about this game are: 1. It actually opens, 2. It has an FOV slider. This game is an awful waste of time made by a bunch of lazy â¥â¥â¥ devs who can't make a proper game. -5/5
1230	1	a	This game ts like Dungeon Defenders but i kinda consider this game much better since you have the ability to place traps pretty much anywhere (ceiling, walls, and floors).   What this game dosent have though is co-op and can make the game quite boring after awhile of playing it...still fun though...  you also can't remap the controls for this game  ---My Rating--- 7.3/10
2675	1	a	Half life 3 GOTY
5759	0	a	This game needs alot of work, feels clunky and unfinished. Would not recommend this to anyone.
735	1	a	Burst the orcs into pieces! Quite a few weapons and tons of traps promise orc-slashing fun. Nice mechanics, pretty good overview, and a funny background story (which is not all too important, I claim :P ).  All in all a rather nice game to play.
1196	1	a	Buy this, for ze Toxo recommends slaying of orcs with traps and spells.
4846	1	a	Its a cool game i would buy it even tho its $1 but really fun game to play with other players co-op game 
3383	1	a	It's aiight.
3483	0	a	i wanted to throw up
3059	1	a	9/11 would bang
4845	1	a	only when its on sale
5850	1	a	Enjoyably Fun 11/10 would Exticnt again
1614	1	a	Interesting Gameplay with the levitate gimmicks and not as casual as it look like.  Programmer wise. but this game lack of coating from Art style and the ONE single music gosh that loop every 20 sec or so i recommand muting the music or you get crazy lol, otherwise fun little game for the unique gameplay.
2521	1	a	I was watching the steam page and I waited for this amazing game to come on sale. It was a dollar so i had a choice watch a porn video on Barzzzars for one dollar or get this amazing game, i made the best choice of my sad and uneventful life, i got this game! I was thinking to my self i may have down's but i got a smashing deal! Opening this game to the menu was amaizing the meu was so well made it was almost as good as the ET game from the 1900's hell this menu was so good i unzipped my pants and started to beat my dino to it. after 2 hours of trying to get in a game with my gay lovers we were in, the graphics were amazing they looked like someone â¥â¥â¥â¥ed on a wall and added in color, then i noticed the best part of this game, the dino's looked and moved like they were mentally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it made me feel accepted in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered world. This game also ran amazing it ran better than bf4 and had much graphics i was getting 2 fps on low! As playing as a dino i realized wtf am i doing, as i write this i pounder killing myself because i spent 1 dollar on this game when i could have been watching cp, this game should get an 11/5 game of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing century. Thanks Sprial Games for putting oon alt-jay and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing me till my â¥â¥â¥ is no exitxtant.
2805	1	a	This game is just awesome!! The game is very fun to play with your friends! :D
3836	0	a	This is so terrible.
1370	1	a	Liked the first game?? Then you gotta buy Shank 2, too!!
3767	1	a	This Game Is Great......Very Glitchy Though hahaha But that my friends is what makes this game AWESOME! 
1350	1	a	It should be illegal for things to be as fun as Shank 2 is
1871	1	a	Not Bad :)
6024	1	a	I totally just beat a triceratops to death. I have wanted to do that ever since I was a kid. Also revamped my hate for pterodactyls.
729	1	a	I get why the Orcs need to die, I really do. But do they HAVE to die? The game never explains why they have to die, or why the wan't to capture the time portal's so badly. Surely their primitive hierarchy of wants and needs can be satisfied with the help of some magic. We don't even know the full story, maybe the portals are Samuri-Jack style way to the past before evil mages took over the orcis agricultural utopia that once existed before hand. We just cant know for certain and for that reason I am a consiencous objector to killing orcs as a TF2 inspired scout-mage until the developers explain why the orcs absolutely 100% MUST die.
1154	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredibly fun, fast paced tower defense game with emphasis on action. You play a War Mage just out of his apprentice training, who must stop orcs from reaching the rifts into your world.  With your old master dead, a cocky attitude, and not the greatest intelligence your kind has ever seen. The world is surely doomed.
3156	1	a	Gets more updates then Day Z Standalone.
1545	1	a	if you like Portal games... you'll like this one... so much fun and bloody! xD
5849	1	a	Dinosaurs, Halo, and Tribes
6419	1	a	This game is actually pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fun (stiff movement aside) cuz who doesn't like getting one shot by a hugeeeeee T-Rex while driving a tank \o/  10/10
3841	1	a	Coop is a blast but the team vs team is wonky and needs to be fixed I found my self nearly unmovable on some maps as a dino.
2224	1	a	I was riding on the back of a T-Rex.  10/10
741	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive First Player Perspective Tower Defence game. Creative level and trap design lets you experiment with different ways of clearing them. Oh. and once you get weavers you can be a mass-slaughterer of orcs personally. Good times!
977	1	a	Highly responsive (UI, sound, controls) FPS tower defense game with a great art style and direction. Leaderboards incite long-term commitment and replay of already consumed content, and the death animations are hilariously fun. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an easy to pick up and fun short game session.
3579	1	a	great fun for your spare time
1398	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
6260	0	a	I don't know about you guys, but for me, this is a weird experience, when i'm in the menu screen, for some reason my graphics card goes up to 60-70 celcius, which is kind of weird, keep in mind i can play Skyrim for hours with it being stable on 60 or maybe 70, but in this game, as soon as i start i can hear the fan speed increasing dramaticly... In case you're wondering what graphics card i use, it's GTX 670.
3314	1	a	Very easy to pick up and put down. Fun with friends.
3265	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
1535	0	a	The gameplay was fun but the boss fights were way to hard
3150	1	a	This game packs alot of punch for a game the costs almost nothing, this game is 79p thats less then a Â£1 and you get so much content and fun for this amount of money  with 15 or more game modes.  theres co op modes, player vs player and player vs player vs dinosaurs.  There are also lots of vehicals from jeeps to tanks to hover bike things to walking robots.  Whats not to love for that price for somthing that awsome right still not sold?   If you could also play as 10 diffrent dinos would that make you want it? well you can.   theres also a dynamic day night weather systme one minute you can be stolling to work at the kill all dino corp office and then it can rain and storm or blizzard if your in the artic any time day or night  the worlds your play in are wide and wonderfull with lots of places to go explore there are also loot chests to find.  so you have guns weapons and cars to drive what about a lightsaber? yes it has one to.  if you feel like flying ther ptreadactol will pick you up and drop you to your doom.  ok now lets talk about the other bits of the game graphicly its not gona win any awards but they are smooth and remind me of halo  where the graphics do shine is during its dynamic weather the freezing on your visor and the rain during the night look stunning :)  The controlls smooth easy bog standard fps controlls.  the xbox controllers work well :) just wish there was a sensativity option for it.  ok youv heard alot so far but for a small price its worth it.  so theres always servers going theres a nice comunity and its fun to play.  Another Pro is the game has devs that care its very rare :) here are some of my favriot moments so far  i Got picked up by petrdctol and droped to my doom wilst falling i managed to finish off a t-rex  i was driving around ran 100 little dinos over hit a tri cerotops and i flew across the map with all my buddys in the car and we drove off in perfect condition   so if you like what iv said so far then go get it if not look at the discription and see if theres anything iv missed about this game as it might sway your vote but hope you enjoy :) this game for the small price you pay you do get a lot of fun
5291	1	a	IGNORE THE BAD REVIEW ON METACRITIC -- that was for a prerelease of the game. All the issues are fixed, and this is fun (and brutal) as heck. and for 99 cents???? whats not to love!
4655	1	a	there are dinos and i guess one mode is kinda like halo. its really stupid... like really really stupid, but i paid a dollar for it. i've played like only 10 minutes of this game and i don't ever plan on playing it again but i guess it's like kinda okay. it seems like just owning the game is some sort of like elite club or whatever so it's kinda cool. the game itself sucks though. it's pretty boring and i didn't really have fun. if it's on sale for less than 2 dollars buy it though i guess.
6158	1	a	This game might not be game of the year material, but it sure is a fun game. You get to shoot, stab and burn dinos, what more do you want? Play as dinos? Good thing you can. It is the game I never knew I wanted, and I love it.
4577	1	a	I play this if im downloading a steam game but OMG ITS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AMAZING MUCH SIMPLE MUCH WOW
6229	1	a	Fun, just fun. Fighting off waves of dines you loved as a child and feeling barney's cousins crushed beneath your tank. Well designed with a few bugs, but very good with friends, or if your really good you can do it yourself and hope you dont die. Overall 8.7/10. my only problem is that my friends are so hard to get together and one of them is too stupid to start a server. (And he is the one with the best internet)
877	1	a	Incredibly fun, witty, and challenging. Not your typical tower defense game; with gorgeous graphics, fun dialogue, and a soundtrack that sounds like Mastadon did a Gregorian Chant album. Addictive gameplay that is absolutely worth the price!
393	0	a	â Nice TPS Defence Trap concept â Good price (2â¬) in Biedronka Store  â Only WSAD â No Tutorial â More shooter then Defence Tower â Sanctum series are much much better then this one â Very difficult
5813	1	a	A little like Killing Floor from when I played before Prelude came out. It's pretty teamwork based with the dinos being creatively made and separately challenging. Smooth graphics and large marketplace for in-game upgrades and perks.
3392	1	a	Awsome game, very fast-paced and it can get overwelming at times, but once you get used to it you will enjoy it. now watch out for compies
376	0	a	Nah. It's not a terrible game, but it's clunky and awkward. Micro-managing the camera angle is half of what you'll do when playing. Go look for a better tower defense game.
2640	1	a	Great game. 100% worth the $.99 it costs. 500% worth it when its on sale for $.50, or 1000% worth it to get the four pack for $.75. I bought 5 of the four packs to share the game with my friends. 10/10 would buy 5 more.
4966	1	a	This game has everything. Amazing glitches, laser rifles, and dinasaurs!  MUST BUY!  IGN - 10/5! GameReviews - 11/10! FunHaus - 9/11
5648	0	a	What can I say... I couldn't pass on a game for 99 cents with screen shots like that!!! But alas, it was only false and high hopes. Personally, I really preffer to try to avoid knocking someones hard work (as I assume someone did at one point put some sort of effort into this at some point) and I wish I could think of something positive about this game but I just can't. Really, it is that bad, and the only thing that this game has working for it is the price on sale. Oh... that's it!!! That something positive I was looking for!!! You should buy it for the price! Just because you have 99 cents laying around that should be in some starving developers pocket! Or you could wait til its regular price and help that starving developer with their alimony payments too!  But seriously, I feel like I've waisted too much of my time (and life) on this game as it is. Which is where I'm coming from when I say that you'll have to trust me on this and donate that 99 cents to help all the neglected and abused dinosaurs of the world. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you too can help save a helpless dinosaur.  Oh, I just though of another positive... Hats! Yes, the game has hats! And best of all you can wear them... Virtually! Yes! In the game! ... Okay yes, hats are not that exciting but it might be you like things on your head! So lets summerize this...  You should buy this game if you:  -Are a Philanthropist for:  -Dinosaurs  -Game Developers or  -Are balding or is bald   -Likes things on you're head  -Likes virtual things on your virtual head more  -Don't need 99 cents or   -Missed the sale and  -Don't need $14.99
2446	1	a	its not necessarily a good game by any means, but oh my god is it a good time. Its not one of those games thats so bad it's fun it just has a bit of charm to it. I do recommend this especially for only $0.99 
1237	1	a	Got this game in the sale, would have been worth it full price though.   Simple and fun.
3562	1	a	The best 79p you will ever spend, probably.
287	1	a	I have wanted this game for a long time..Thanks steam for a wonderful sale!!! Let the killing begin!
4433	1	a	Its Free To Play And Very Nice Game I Recommend It.
5157	0	a	No so laggy, crashes a ton, and when a dino attacks from behind you can't even turn and shoot. Not worth it and please i want a refund!!!!
961	1	a	Two words best describe this game: fun and addictive. Few things are quite as satisfying as defeating wave after wave of orcs with all sorts of traps and spells.
3394	1	a	omg, this game is my game of 1994, the graphics are amzing, no bugs and a huge amount of servers to choose from with an active community.  10/10 would run on vista again.
5170	1	a	this game is amazing and fun 10/10
4348	1	a	Got in a jeep and was eaten by T-rex. 11/10
4761	0	a	Played A while Back When It had a free weekend deal thing ( Before this F2P version) It was Okay Then. Now it is bad. I think people who paid for the first game should get a refund. (not including me)
5221	0	a	I dont... I dont even know wtf is going on anymore.
2841	1	a	Amazing game! Love the graphics!
4508	1	a	Its okay, it could use ALOT of work.  The Good Multiplayer/singleplayer Tons of weapons Tons of vehicles Customization Gamemodes  The Bad Weird Animations Being unable to connect to the servers  Buying outfits (Really Trek -_-) Glitchs/bugs Able to get to spots and survive for insane amounts of time TEH LAG!  Thats about all I can think of. No game is perfect, I like how Trek is stil working on this game and updating it.  My opinion: Would play 6.5/10
2845	1	a	llol i shoot a terex an it kill but i die cuz herbivore???
5753	1	a	It's a mindless shooter. Reminds me of nazi zombies from Call of Duty series. Waves of dinos to kill, points to score and spend on guns and upgrades. I wouldn't pay $60 for it - maybe 4 years ago I would've. Graphics are kinda dated... but $#!t it was 99 cents!
6448	1	a	Dispite what some people say this game is actually pretty fun! It is amazing how they managed to completely turn it around. I played it when it was in early access and it was terible but now it is great! It's fun with your friends and the combat feels strong imstd of being floppy and bouant. I'd give it a 8/10!
4274	0	a	Huge rip off. I paid about 80 cents for the second time this was released (this is now it's third release and it's free 2 play now). Wish I could get those 80 cents back.
680	1	a	A very fun and enjoyable game. Played at friends house and knew it was a must have.
5013	1	a	Flipping the bird while running over dinosaurs with tank -9000/10
2245	1	a	Halo ft. Dinosaurs. Still buggy but constantly updated, get some friends, crack open a box of Scooby Snacks and don't go into the long grass
150	1	a	WTF is it? - Orcs Must Die! is a third-person trap laying orc slaying monster delaying tower defense game. It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.  Verdict - Well worth the time and money.  BTW - This is better than that Rift mmo.
1575	1	a	A funny and tough one.
4133	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
4617	1	a	Fun and super cheap right now
4388	1	a	its is quite a fun little first person shooter i think if you like these sort of games you should defenatly have a try
1246	1	a	Easily the best 15 bucks I've ever spent :)
6199	1	a	Really solid game. For what its worth, it's absolutely awesome. Sure it isnt grade a, but what more would you want for a buck? High potential for fun, and just overall badassery.
944	1	a	Great game, fun, entertaining. What could be better than roll over some overgrown orcs!
1080	1	a	One of the most fun defense games out
2396	1	a	God damn autistic as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 11/10
2472	1	a	This game has hot dogs you should buy it
1115	1	a	Had more fun playing this than I've had gaming in some time.  It's fast paced, creative and very funny.  And lets face it, who doesn't like killing orcs with everything from floor spikes to tipping them into acid...
4275	0	a	Became free to play because it was not even worth 1 cent
2697	1	a	Mech machine can get on top of a helicopter. 10/10
4695	0	a	it is so bad i can even think anymore
1728	1	a	Charming game. Would recommend for no more than 3$/2.50â¬.
2729	1	a	This game.....I feel like im watching an albanian mock-up of Jurassic Park. It's absolutley wonderful 11/10
121	1	a	Orc Must Die is typically one of those indie games that must be in the library of those gamers who a) like the RPG genre b) are fond of indie games. This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.  It is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.  If you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.
763	1	a	fun game...plays smoothly...not overly hard but some maps you do have to plan accordingly or you might let a few get through
1701	1	a	creative adictive game, love it
1807	1	a	I bought this game for 19 cents. Walked away for 7 hours. Got 3 trading cards and sold them all for 27 cents. 11/10 would profit again.
2744	1	a	Spawn into halo-ish world. Have no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to do. Have a gun. It fires laser balls. Get into a car with tractor wheels. Run over 27 dinosaurs. Stegasaurus tail-whips car across map.  Jump out. Buy flamethrower. Go insane. Get picket up by flying dino â¥â¥â¥â¥ and dropped from the sky.  27/10 Recommended.
1046	1	a	Good tower defense game.
3307	0	a	it is nothing like Jurassic Park
5671	0	a	I believe beep is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. This game completely changed my life. I was going through some rough times and the 30 minutes I spent on Beep changed my life. This is the best game ever it stopped me from drinking the full 10 ounces of bleach in order to kill myself. The complex and emotional story had me in awe. The bonk engine made this game look like it was real life. The vibrant colors and effects makes this game look on par with games like Battlefield One. If you do not already have this game buy it RIGHT NOW.
5534	1	a	This game is a little like passing a kidney stone made out of angels.  Space robots fighting dinosaurs is something i only knew about from the ramblings of my drunk uncle when i was but a child, to be able to experience it first hand, brings forth a feeling of pride, honor and dinosaurs to me.    If you like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥, buy this game.  If you don't like dinosaurs and robots and â¥â¥â¥â¥ please consider sounding with a fire extinguisher.
4928	1	a	Nothing can go wrong with dinosaurs!
1251	1	a	The Orcs jut nedz moar dakka WWWAAARRRGGG!!!!
6143	1	a	AW MAN. this game is HOT. It has everything but a story, so I just pretend we are settlers, clearing the way for more settlers! its Halo-esque and Borderlandsy feel aids in you feeling great about the sensless re- extinction of the ancient species. I love it.
2572	1	a	This game is amazingly fun for how cheap it is.  If you want some quick laughs, buy the 4-pack and gift the games your friends so you can play together and share the insanity!
4339	1	a	I don't care what people say, this game is worth at least $15 but I payed .99c for it. I killed a Triceratops and a Stegasaurus with an op tank but was run down by a massive Spinysaurus. Get it, play it with friends and enjoy it. 10/10 It's Halo with dinosaurs.
5198	0	a	This game is a terrible joke.
2259	1	a	This game made me realize that judging a game based on Critic reviews is a big mistake. I just don't know why people complain about this game. This game is very enjoyable and has hours of fun!
4672	1	a	Steam tells me I already own this game. I do not. What gives?
4922	1	a	Kinda like if Turok meets Halo meets Counter Strike. For 99 cents it's really fun. Even though the graphics are on Halo's level for some reason this game cooks the hell out of my video card.
4163	1	a	Dinosaur heads that run around, pirate dinosaurs, soldiers riding dinosaurs and idiots, your teammates who will better camp on a rock than revive you. 10/10 would die again.
4416	1	a	This game is so much fun, and so under rated. Don't pay attention to the metascore because if it was me scoring it, I would probably score it maybe a 83 or something around that, it has decent graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and i'm sure that a lot more content will be added in the future. Let's help this game grow and get even better than it already is by supporting this game. It is awesome.
3768	1	a	Well, it's okay for a cheap game.
5828	1	a	Basically Jurassic Park. Those huge dinosaurs are super freaky.
5368	1	a	Metascore is way low!! this games actually pretty fun.. PvP needs some improvement but honestly I would pay full price after having such a good first experience playing this game  Definitely reccommend!!
2214	1	a	THIS GAME IS ONLY .99 AND ITS VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS I PURCHASED 5 COPIES OF THIS AND SENT TO FRIENDS THIS IS A COMBINATION OF HALO + BORDERLANDS 2 + Planetside 2 I ENJOYED IT A LOT 10.5/10
3139	1	a	Pretty decent game, fun to play with friends, defenetly worth the 1 dollar
1254	1	a	uhh you kill orcs... funny ways... do it..... buy it.... now....  I am hobo and I approve this message
2945	1	a	ORION: Prelude is great horde game. It is really unique style. I absolutly recomend it!
4236	0	a	Your connection to the host has been lost.
4484	0	a	I don't even know why am I tried it.
5915	1	a	Fun Shooters. I was hoping I could become the Dinosaurs lol. But anyway, fun games to be played with friends or family.
1424	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
2424	1	a	I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.
751	1	a	A really good, entertaining and challenging game with a lot of replay value that will test your true abilities in the tower defense genre. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand at all and can only be truly mastered by practicing and playing the game through trial and error, how it should be in my opinion. A definite buy for any lover or tower defense games.
1191	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4326	0	a	I paid 16 cents and I feel like I payed too much
1851	1	a	Why did i buy this?!
710	1	a	More fun than I bargained for. Worth the purchase 100%!!!!
5161	0	a	This game is basically Call of Duty Ghosts: Extinction mode or Black Ops: Zombies mode - but no way near as good in terms of quality; and with Dinosaurs.  Only buy if cheap.
5702	0	a	This was the launch title for the Ouya but got ported to steam by mistake. Please write the Ouya company to refund the buyers.
1525	0	a	This game it a bit broken... Its not possible to set the key mapping yourself and you are forced to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD. It is bought in steam but registered in Origin (?) THis is abother EA fail game... Same for CNC4 and Mirror Edge.    4/10
901	1	a	I'm hooked on this game. It has the right blend of puzzle solving and shooter gameplay to keep me coming back for more. There are variable solutions (aka trap combinations) to deal with the endless orcs, gnolls, kobolds and hellbats which keeps me coming back trying to get that last elusive skull. The main character apprentice war-mage is great; it's like Charlie Sheen playing Harry Potter (he even says 'Winning' in the game). The difficulty curve does get steep about 3/4 of the way through the game, where it starts to feel impossible to get perfection on a level. Would be cool if there was some form of co-op multiplayer on this, but I'm hopeful that this game will have DLCs in the future to include new traps, levels, player-characters.
830	1	a	9 out of 10. It took me about 12 hours to get through the 18 map campaign, and I've spent at least another 12 going back and replaying the levels to try to get more achievements and better level scores. Each map probalby takes 10 minutes to play. You run around setting up traps (kind of tower defense-like) to kill the orcs, kobolds and ogres as they try to make their way through the map from the gate to your rift. You have weapons as spells for direct combat. It's fun to see if you can build the best configuration of traps to stop all the monsters. Single player only. Very stable, I only noticed one very minor bug with a monster getting stuck in lava and not dieing, but I was able to work around it. The character you play is very humorous in the things he says and does, as are the orcs.
1799	1	a	The itself is so boring but beep is so cute he'll have you coming back for more &lt;3
6257	1	a	360 no scoped a t-rex offof a cliff... 11/10
821	1	a	Stupid fun, but it gets really hard down the road. Army of Darkness feeling, and full of cheesy lines.
5760	1	a	what did you expect when you paid a dollar for a game. that being said its a good way to kill time with freinds. 10/10
2460	1	a	Its just fun, I don't know how else to explain it. Little sweet $5 game.
4569	1	a	This Game Is Great It Has Alot Of Bugs But they can be forgotten as its gameplay is great and for $1 its a great deal
511	1	a	This game is great!!!
5473	1	a	I want a refund (most of people won t understand)
6166	1	a	You look at this game, and you think...Ehhhh, is it worth it? It looks kinda (dumb, simple, noobish, glitchy, whatever), so you seriously don't consider getting it. Get it. Its probably worth at least 5 dollars, and future updates can only make it better xD  Gun system very similar to CSGO, with weapons that are based on the same type (heavy deagle like pistol, AUG like gun), but that doesn't make it a knockoff. Its very unique, with a very fun, adventureous feel. The community is nothing but friendly, and learning to play is easy. Its a fun way to meet some new online friends, or play with some old ones. If it is its worth you're worried about, don't.   Now, it is not a top notch game. The mouse is super sensitive, so you have to adjust it every now and then. Sometimes settings dont stay saved, so you have to reset them. Servers are kinda glitchy, so sometimes it takes a minute to join. It is a .99 cent game, so bugs are there. If you want a top of the line, everything must be aboslutely perfect and run smoothly kinda game, this probably isn't up your alley. It takes a little patience, but only a little.   Overall? Get it, unless you're really, reaaaally picky. You'll love it. Kill some dinos for me!
164	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game. You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways. In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them. This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side. After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn. These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians.   After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME. I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions). Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay! There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost. It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.   However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs. Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat. If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube. And if you like what you see, buy it. Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.   TLDR: 10/10   Disclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review. Harmed before, oh hell yes!
2253	1	a	an unpolished gem, get more servers and you guys good to go. im having fun playing with my friends, but with a helluva ping. 8/10
1872	1	a	This game is a GREAT platformer. Different than the stereotypical one because you can use/alter/destroy a portion of your surroundings and there are lots of puzzles to solve. The only thing that could possibly make this game better would be steam achievements, since some of the puzzles are quite difficult, and it would feel good to get an achievement for some of them, or general accomplishments.
420	1	a	Awesome tower defense style game - blast to play on the ground
3625	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber while flying with a jetpack....Need i say more?
3529	1	a	This game gets a lot of bad reviews that are very true but what did they think the game was gunna be? its about Storm Troopers killing T-rex's and it cost way too much but if you by it on sale and want a fun lan party game its very good becuase of how bad it is like a lot of old movies. Artemis the space ship simulator game is a amazing lan game that i would recommend before this and is worth the large price tag but is as of now not avalible through steam. 
3966	1	a	I would complain about the sometimes ugly effects I would complain about how much of the game seems to be copying aspects from Halo and borderlands I would complain about the upgrade icons in the store being super low-res  But who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ complains about a game that costs 80 pence when NOT on sale.
3198	1	a	This game is highly addicting. And packs a whole punch for such a cheap price.
4055	0	a	To be fair, the games not too bad. But thats it, its average AT BEST. Sadly its not horridly broken which wouldve honestly made it more enjoyable as sometimes glichy randome events are fun but thats not the case. I only gave it a negative review becasue i spent like $0.40 on a 4 pack of codes, which are now completely worthless. Thanks Spiral Games.
4398	1	a	what am i doing with my life
1137	1	a	Very fun mix of combat and tower defence, very funny humor, and challenging. Great game aside from not having multiplayer (the 2nd one will).
3088	1	a	This game has gone from one of the worst games to the most fun time waster on steam. This is proof that there is no such thing as a bad game, just developers who don't care.  10/10 best fun:cost game on steam
1453	1	a	Although Shank 2 will last you somewhat longer than its predecessor, it is mainly due to, at times, frustrating encounter design where you'll struggle to differentiate enemies from the background and enemies who are perfectly capable of stunlocking you in certain group compositions. Also worth noting is that already simple but effective story structure from the original is further diluted and merely serves as framing device to move you from location to location without any personal involvement. That's not to say all is bad in Shank 2, though. On the contrary; game plays to its old strengths - more cosmetic unlocks were added, scoreboard bragging rights are still around and combat is still as satisfying as ever. It almost evens things out. Almost.
4061	1	a	Best piece of plagarised content you'll ever regret spending 50 cents on!
6312	0	a	Just...Don't.
5088	0	a	Listen Ok I really enjoyed this game it was pretty fun but not for the price I got it for you guys got it for only a buck do you know what i got it for 15 dollars the only reason i wouldnt recommend this game is i didnt get my money back if i get my $14 back I will recommend it
2003	1	a	Mario in beep version. It's cool to play it at work :))
613	1	a	This game is a fun tower defense game, because not only you build things to defend but you can control and customize your character on how you defend the stage, the stages are challenging and different in variety. I like the cartoonish graphics and the very comedic vibe that it has. For over all verdict I'd say that this game is fun and challenging, and I would like to recommend it to everyone.
718	1	a	Christmas and New Year 2011 was written off because of this game. It was well worth it too!
2375	1	a	Better than Angry Birds
3472	1	a	0.5 dollar play with 4 friends worth it.
2981	1	a	This game is by far one of the best games on steam and can be played for hours on end. nothing says a great game like guns dinosaurs. The fact that you can play it with friends makes it so fun and replayable also with different maps and different gamemodes there is a new adventure ever time. there is so much to be said about this game but to some it up in two words they would be 'Pure Badass'.
3140	1	a	Defiently a way to say â¥â¥â¥â¥ the ecosystem. Had fun making the dinosaurs go extinct.
2828	1	a	This game is a must buy if you like the early halo series IE 1-3 , if you like jet packs gears of war or dinosaurs. This game started out broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥ when it first came out and a lot of people got really butt hurt that this game was broken. But guess what they fixed literally every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing people complained about. I bought the game when it was broken and shelved it for a bit and came back after fixes. But this games early community seems to be a bunch of limped dicked â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es because they still troll this game ..... They have no right to talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this game any more, the dev's truly made a cult classic out of this one and if your still upset about this game then it is time to move on it is great now stop living in the past.   This game is and will forever be one of my favorites not only because Dinos + jet packs + mechs with a Halo 2 meets gears look about it. But because the devs kicked â¥â¥â¥ and took a broken game they could have abandoned, and really polished the hell out of it. I have bought not just one copy but at least 10 so far because it is an amazing game to play with friends . Takes me back to when I use to do LAN parties as a kid :D  Do yourself a favor hop on and enjoy.
5684	0	a	I paid for this game and now its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free alright go â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur self
3435	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot. Truly the best experience one could hope to have killing dino's with advanced technology.   And at the low low price of 1$ (during the steam sale) you would be an absolute fool to not buy this game on the spot and giggle in glee as you and your friends shoot and destroy dinos with various vehicles and weapons.   Game of the year 2013/2014/2015.  Buy it now.  9001/9001  2 1337 4 M3
1356	1	a	This game is extremely fun but the survival mode is damn near impossible alone.
619	1	a	At first glance of hearing a third person tower defense threw me of, made it think it wasnt worth my time, as soon as i bought due to the sale i know its worth the full price itself. the total destruction of orcs is amazing.
1721	0	a	+ nice idea + simple game - boring - nothing special through entire play
2779	1	a	Possibly the most fun you'll have with a bad game.  10/10 would bang.
3773	1	a	Edit: After giving the game another chance, it seems to be running fine now, weirdly enough, and is performing much better at a stable 24 fps. Gameable with friends when looking for a light shooter with something different. Easy to pick up and play. Still I'd like the guns to be a bit more fleshed out, with one pistol being mentionable as possibly being enough to play with as it can effortlessly take down everything and comes with infinite ammo, no recoil and it's fully automatic.
4135	1	a	Muahaha.. its free to play this game now!!   i got this 2 months ago, then refunded it 'cos the game wasnt played nicely on my pc. Multiple crashes in the game, laggy in some parts.  Should just lower the price to .10 cents so those trading cards will still get drop.
1504	1	a	If you fancy something a little different and enjoy testing yourself then this is definitely for you. Fantastic game to get away from the rages of other games!
3503	1	a	Doesn't seem to run very well with AMD graphics cards.
4704	1	a	omfg,evolve must be like this.There is 0.50$.T-rekt 
777	1	a	Great and addictive game. Worth to buy it.
4065	0	a	This game is trash the controlls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the combat is teribad. Humans are favored in this game with more then one attack, unlike a dino. this is by far the worst dino game ever. Prepare to die and lose everytime if your a Dino.
997	1	a	Wacky, wonky and tons of fun. easy to pick up, hard to finish.
610	1	a	-Addicting Gameplay  -Nice Creature -I Like Cartoonize graphics Video games -Its Extended Verison of PvZ garden warfare maybe ;)
1056	1	a	Not to be confused with 'Goblins Must Die' ' Kobolds Must Die' 'Bugbears Must Die' and 'All Dire-Celestial-Vampiric Chairs Must Be Dismantled' Orcs Must Die is a game where I'm awesome. Yes, I am awesome, thank you for asking. The orcs come at me and they must die because I'm awesome. I also don't want to massage corn so there's that too.  I have spinny-whirly dealies and spikey things and make things go BOOM! to make orcs go deader. Because orcs being alive are not being dead enough. They don't like it when you slice and dice them and shoot them and burn them and crush them and fling them and feed them to ogres and get other people to shoot them or slice them. I suggest lightly steamed with a dip of tar as a good option, or maybe filled with bolts. It's really up to you, who is me in this case, and awesome.
5553	0	a	Hello, today I am here to write a review for the game - Orion: Prelude. Let me start by saying this game is absolutely terd awful, and I don't think anyone should have ever even tried it let alone it get to over 1 million copies sold. I have played this game for some time with my friends and after being avid fans of killing floor this seemed like a complete rip off. But with aspects from other games like borderlands and it's second wind. I think this game is poop and everyone should know im only writing this review for a steam badge. Thank you.
3771	1	a	So. This game has a horrible rating from years ago that it's been struggling to recover from, but it's not terrible. It's a fun game to play with friends once in awhile. The main reason I originally had any interest in it was because it wasn't another boring predictable zombie shooter like 90% of other shooters on the market right now.   It's not flawless. There are bugs and glitches and exploits and optimization issues, but overall, it's like a 6.5/10 game, pretty solid. At least where PVE game modes are concerned.   Every single match I've ever played of PVP, lowest ping won. The game seems to just have awful netcode as far as PVP is concerned, and ping makes more difference than skill 100% of the time. There's also a lot of major balancing issues, and a few game-breaking bugs. Like, one of the first times I entered the PVPVE game mode, there was just one guy cloak knifing everyone. There's an awful exploit on the Cryo Knife that allows people to spam knife attacks instantly as fast as they can click their mouse, and it hasn't been fixed over the last several updates, so meh. â¥â¥â¥â¥ anything pvp-related in this game. If you want to have a good experience, stick to survival and/or conquest with friends.
386	0	a	Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of like Torchlight II. You really need a pet or an ally to help you. This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings. It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything. I never could master the gameplay. The demo was fun to play. The rest of the game was a nightmare.
1492	1	a	lemme just say...I hate Origin...the game was fun though :)
4234	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
2116	1	a	YOU NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR: THE âI THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARDâ AWARD  Deserving.
4872	1	a	Laggy and crashed during my first game but seems fun.
617	1	a	Best TD there is.
4346	0	a	WHAT THE FLYING FADOODILY â¥â¥â¥â¥KKKKKKKK. THIS GAME SUCKS DIRTY BUTT HOLE. EVERYTIME I TURN AROUND THE DINOSAURS â¥â¥â¥â¥ ME IN THE DAMN â¥â¥â¥. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ STORY BORING AND â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ X2.â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ ASS â¥â¥â¥ DAMN â¥â¥â¥â¥.

1651	1	a	A very wierd but fun game that makes me think of Gauntlet for some reason  Video Review Below:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269705143 
3436	1	a	This is the greatest game I've ever played.
444	1	a	Even once you beat the game, it's loads of fun to play!
4151	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
917	1	a	Great hero TD
900	1	a	Very Fun mix of a Castle Defense and 3rd person Action game.Can play a round in 20 minutes or less or play for hours. Lots of replay-ability and fun combos with the traps.
866	1	a	This game runs face-first into the same problem that Sanctum did - that success relies on one correct strategy from the beginning. Not only that, but you get to upgrade your traps, and if you mess that up by putting them in the wrong areas, there's no refunds - you actually have to start a new profile.  The graphics, music, sound and concept all receive an A, but the number of flawed tower defense games on this planet are as innumerable as the stars.
5210	1	a	Could use a tutorial Also better than all the new CoD games... srly... WHY DO YOU GUYS KEEP BUYING THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥?
6369	1	a	This game is amazing!!!!!! 9/10 stars epic game for an epic price!!! Only downside controller support not quite complete maybe if use special was use if you are around a vechile or generator so you don't have to press E every time you want to use an object when using a controller.
3718	0	a	I would love this game if every five seconds I didn't crash. Now note I have a very nice and fast gaming computer. Other then that though the game is very well rounded although it needs a litlle work.
5557	0	a	This game is an awful piece of dinosaur poop, and doesn't deserve more than one sentence in a review about it.
3045	1	a	i like to shoot the dino and think that the gun is my wiener and i am peeing
5102	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
4562	0	a	Its not a game with bugs, its bugs whit a game.
1020	1	a	Orcs Must Die has, for me, devolved into a 'Must get and retain high score Vs my friends'.... still gotta get that for the first map...  As a fan of both FPS and TD, I very much enjoy this hybrid. Thanks to Kruel Handlebar for introducing me to this....
5045	0	a	its currently $0.99 i would reccomend you spend that dollar on a burger from mcdonalds...yes this game is that bad
2530	1	a	Cool game :)
1983	1	a	A nice platformer with a cute character and style
5424	0	a	Great optimization! 2/10! CS:GO runs on my laptop in 4k highest settings i 70-100fps, dis shet runs at same settings with a shetload of 14 fps! Eyes dont hurt! But thats not all, if i put it down to 720p on low settings i get a beloved 2fps more! Dunno if its my 860m gfx card thats the fault or something else on my pc, or is it just the game itself :/ Because of those problems, i didnt test the game fairly good :P Defineitly (or hau dafuq is it spelled) recommened dis game if u wanna get a pair of glasses, but ur eyes are perfect and ur mom says u dont need dem!
3240	1	a	14 hours and still not bord so..... ya i have also put 270+ hour in terraria another game i highly recamend
1374	1	a	Really nice game! The Co-op survival mode is really fun! You can get many hours of playtime when trying to unlock all of the characters.
4319	0	a	The only good thing about this game is driving your teammates off a cliff.
4937	1	a	Bought a lightsaber went to play Star Was with dinosaur  Dinousaur didnt like Star Wars Killed dinousar 10/10 will fight over Star Wars again  P.S RIP Dinosaur 2015-2015
5818	1	a	Best game ever, the Birdemic of video games
3067	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, and you also enjoy slaughtering them, this is your game! 10/10 - IGN
1508	0	a	Neat idea for a stealth action, sorta metroidvaniay kind of game. However, suffers from frame rate issues, poor gamepad support (mine only functioned 90% of the time, which isn't enough), UI problems, and swingy difficulty curves.  It's hard to really sum up how all the little problems just add up against Warp. Small stuff like having to go back to an older checkpoint, so you can resave at your current one.  Some of the worst parts of the game for me were the optional challenge rooms, which thankfully were truely optional.  I actually ended up playing all the way to the final boss, then decided I wasn't having enough fun to want to spend the last 30 minutes to finish the janky, unpleasant fight, just to see the ending.  Really the definition of a below average game. This could have been much better with just even a little more consideration of the overall package.  Avoid this one and save your money for the next stealth game.
5406	1	a	Dino's everywhere.The next viral thing on the internat.
2097	1	a	Why the hell do games nowadays NEVER have any dinosaurs?  This game has dinosaurs. 10/10, Game of the Year, best 50ct I've ever spent. Seriously, this game was hella fun for a few hours. I'd say it's well worth the money.
657	1	a	very fun its a must buy
2657	1	a	Is the best game
5620	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/  TL;DR: The developers have been stealing copyrighted content to put in there games, however, this is not the sole reason I am giving this game a negative review, the developers have also been trying to victimize themselves by trying to make a big social media backlash for the DMCAs, and threatens to 'take legal action' against anyone that 'spreads false information' about their situation...
3705	0	a	This game is a bit like Halo meets Turok. My problem with this game is that the trailers, like most games, don't really do it justice. The trailer looks pretty awesome but it misrepresents the movements of the dinosaurs and the players. It is much more choppy. I would recommend personalizing the controls as well. One big thing that would make this a bit better are things like, headshots [either instant kill or massive damage]. I don't know how many times I drilled into a raptor's face and it was still chewing on my gun... Very frustrating. It has potential but it is not there yet, in my opinion.
5631	1	a	I bought the game and now its free $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$44
1394	1	a	Same as first one, only little longer but still funny action game...and you will still think that script wrote Tarantino/Rodriguez but didn't have enough of red color and limbs of all kind. :D
4167	1	a	A great game . Very addictive . Would get chomped by TREX again 10/10
2323	1	a	If you're looking for a triple AAA platnum seller, then go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a shooter that runs decently where you kill dinosaurs just for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles, then you've come to the right store page! First of all, the game has a really cheap price tag attached to it, but that doesn't mean it's not a good game. Again, it's no game of the year award winner, but you really get a lot out of this for the price you pay, especially if you're buying it for only $1. If nothing else, it makes for a great game to play on rainy days when you lose your internet connection. Just fire up the game, turn on bots, and have more fun than you might expect. I played this once a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but recently I played it again and was surprised to see that the devs have been updating the game, which is really saying a lot when you think about how little most devs care once they get your money. So come on! Buy the game, install it, and have yourself some fun. It's $0.99 and I can pretty much guaranty that you'll get your money's worth out of it.
2851	1	a	drove my friend into a t-rex 10/10
215	1	a	surprisingly deep and addicting. Giddy up before the sequel releases!
196	1	a	Get this game. Kill orcs. Have fun. Get extra maps for the sequel.
6210	1	a	Not the best game ever, but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was 99 cents.
3456	1	a	A lot better than Dino Horde, absolutly love this from a open-world/dinomode/co-op perspective
3406	1	a	Besty game 2010 cooldnt ask 4 betr game to b made, jk! This game peice of crap in bumhole! Cant even no scope nothin caus guns only pistols god damm jesuz plz! orio prelube is 0/100 even for 1 dollar is still squabbly to play. Cant even get startd to play be4 i die to DAMM RAPTORS OF DEATH! dc approved this game because of marvel iron man. plz ackowledg me cause i really good at leegue of leggings.
2404	1	a	 ORION: Prelude   ORION: Dino Beatdown   ORION: Dino Horde  ORION: Dino DLC is a shining light in an otherwise dark and gloomy sea of poorly thought out RPGs, Shooters, and MMOs. This game is completely flawless in every way, a perfect example of a 10/10 rating, a number given too often to sub-par titles such as Mass Effect and Call Of Duty. ORION: Dino Beatdown is an instant classic, and surely stands up to the best as an action adventure indie casual racing game. For only  $8.99  $14.99 (Plus the price of any of the fabulous DLC you can purchase! I recommend the Gangnam Style dance pack myself!), you can't afford not to add this amazing title to your collection. Don't forget to donate to the Kickstarter for the upcoming ORION Project too! Support indie devs!
61	1	a	Good game, although about poker, none poker skill require. Kinda half strategic gameplay (make your hands stronger, while prevent opponent from getting stronger hands and using powercards) and half luck (all cards come out ramdonly). Still, the only thing I really hate in this game is some enemies' powercards are cheating.
5168	0	a	trash. theif. don't play
5217	1	a	Jurassic Simulator with buggy animation. 9/11 would play again
2516	1	a	i brought this game because it was on offer and it may be cheap but its fun to play with you and your mates you can set up a server or join one so ill give it 9.5/10
2358	0	a	I dont know if im doing something wrong but i have big fps lags with this game, when the rest of tha games i have works well
4046	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
2776	1	a	This is the gameplay Call of Duty: Zombies wished it had. Very fluent, groomed and polished little game. Fun playing solo, and an even better time playing online with friends. Rewarding class/tier and weapon upgrades to demolish dozens of Dinos in a satisfying manner. Definately worth the price. 85/100
6087	1	a	this game is good for the price buy it...dont listen to the meta score....i enjoyed it and i only bought it for 1 $...
2724	1	a	Just 5 hours in and I've already got the game by the throat, and then it goes and throws me for a loop all over again, something that doesn't happen to often. It's a great game to play with friends and laugh as they get eaten by dinos, and then get laughed at when you get eaten by the same dino. Easy to get a grip on, tough to actually master, the A.I might not be the smartest, but it still makes you work, no matter what weapon you have in your hand(s).  Give it a go, you can't go too wrong with this, plus who hasn't wanted to grab big guns and slaughter thousands of dinosaurs?
3316	1	a	Bloody brilliant, great for the whole family
4223	0	a	literally garbage
1908	1	a	Actually very fun. It's childish but still fun, loved it.
3818	1	a	Its like HALO but with dinos.
1412	1	a	fun to play and great gameplay
3549	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
1195	1	a	So addictive!!!!
6379	1	a	I reckon this should be on a humble indie bundle.   You really can't give a bad review of this game given its only a dollar and is still supported by the devs after 3 years!
2239	1	a	drive around run around fly around and kill those dinos. loads of fun and laughter and best played with friends!
681	1	a	Simple and fun tower defence game. Solid and stylised graphics with a slick sense of humour. Difficulty curve is a bit all-over-the-place but the gameplay and enjoyment shine through
2450	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ Metacritic and their BS score they gave to the game, it has dinosaurs and thus is awesome as â¥â¥â¥â¥. The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).  Okay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.  Tl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.
2399	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
4128	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
5994	1	a	pretty fun coop game, great value. could be better graphics (reminds me of Tribes) but the coop gameplay is fun. would not recommend playing offline solo.
4254	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosaurs.
3167	1	a	Good FPS game in low price.
780	1	a	What games used to be. Simple in concept, fun to play and very addictive. The orcs must die!!! Bit of strategy with FPS action a great stress reliever. Don't take it too seriously and you'll love it.   The easy levels are just that easy, the harder ones are much much harder and will make you work for it.   Never knew there were so many way's to kill orcs.
815	1	a	An action oriented tower defence game, where you are right in the midst of the battle, tossing down traps, casting fireballs and building crazy trap combos. Good mechanics, cheerful aesthetics, funny lines... The comboing mechanic is cool, but a bit under used. Especially if you don't care about getting the high score and would rather concentrate on getting a perfect run.
1798	1	a	I bought this game for my friend as a troll, when he kept asking me for GTA V. I bought it for myself to mock him, and I've come to actually enjoy this game. After that, I bought my friend GTA V, but we are still playing this game.
405	1	a	Very fun 3rd person tower defense game - plays out a lot like team fortress 2's MvM mode without the co-op. Just enough variation in the levels to keep it interesting and the option for nightmare mode with all of the unlocked upgrades boosts its replayability. Expect about 10 hours for the first run through and if you're a perfectionist, ample more after that on nightmare mode trying to obtain 5 skulls. Definitely recommended, especially since it can be founds cheap.
5332	1	a	It wont work I hate it
2209	1	a	My mum bought this for me and told me this is COD:GO the dinomen mod but there was not enough black men without eyes. - Halnoter Jafin
1747	1	a	Get it soon now, as it got big discount, only cost few bucks. It's a good game to wasting your times btw
1497	0	a	EA accout crap.
3646	1	a	Vass: 'Have I ever told you the deffinion of insanity?'  Me: 'No, but I have played ORION Prelude so I think I know it'
3441	1	a	literally the best game of all time  â¥â¥â¥â¥ dilos tho  11/10 buy now
4991	1	a	the amazing prelude to Guardians of Orion, this game will give you endless hours of fun with friends online. definetely take advantage of the price, this game is worth well over the dollar you paid for it!
5965	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pUa-Ot_jaI 
6402	1	a	Guns, dinosaurs, vehicles, a lightsaber and even some horrible game design! You can even play as the dinosaurs! Why has this sat in my steam folder for so long?!? Everything I have ever wanted in a co-op game and more 10/10.
489	1	a	Welcome to customs, please follow the sparking lines here and here, they'll lead you to your death... filthy immigrants. Yet the game raises actual questions of modern society... it's still fun.
2557	1	a	420/10 would buy
1948	1	a	Having cute playing style, BEEP is a good game for killing time. BTW it's the second cheapest game (next to CS:GO) to collect Steam cards and as the game itself is only 0.19$ now, don't miss the chance!!
5830	1	a	really fun would reccomend to others thrilling game modes and detail.
4169	1	a	It's enjoyable, and better than most FPS I've seen on the PC. They allow a large amount of room when it comes to how you want to play and develop your character depending on the group you are with. Of course if you keep playing the same people you will eventually develop a routine and some amazing synergy with your fellow hunters.
1540	0	a	I'd recommend against picking this one up. The game was clearly built for the XBOX and so it doesn't control very well on the PC. Worse, is that the game, while novel, is not intuitive; ultimately you will find yourself getting through obstacles via trial &amp; error.   I like the idea of the game, but it's poorly executed and poorly ported.
3171	1	a	This game proves why critic scores are pretty much useless for judging the value of a game. Play as dino or man, hunter or hunter. Eat or shoot your prey. Drive your friends off a cliff. Eat raptors for health.   Buy this and play it with your mates. Solo is fun but co-op is insanely fun.
6424	1	a	i bought 3 copies of this game for my friends to play, it was an epic idea but sucked when it was down to gameplay but not...oh but now i wanna hug the devs
1935	0	a	got it for free, would never buy it
4640	1	a	this game is friggin awesome! deff would recommend it!
6182	1	a	Hours of fun if you have awsome buddys to play with. i give it a 10/10 if there was a rating system!

5942	1	a	I saw this game when it was brand new, Orion: Dino Beatdown. It was cheap and the videos and pictures I saw made the game look like one of those b-rate jewels that was so bad, it was good. By bad, I do not mean that it's a horrible game, broken and unplayable. Rather, 'bad' in a way that one would eat nutritionally void foods because they are 'good'. If you want arcade type fun and mindlessly wasting hoards of dinosaurs, then this is the game for you. It's best played with a group of friends on voice chat so you can losely communicate tactics as what to do and laugh your â¥â¥â¥ off at how awesomely 'bad' this game is. Lots of connection issues, my ping is always through the roof (400+) Changing maps kicks you. Best to host a game yourself.  Breakdown: Graphics 7/10 Story 6/10 Gameplay 6/10 Reliability 5/10 Fun 9/10  Overview: Fun dinosaur shootem-up that is best played with friends and a couple drinks!
5214	0	a	Even for 40p it's utter crap. Unoptimized, boring and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics. That's all I have to say.
3398	1	a	its a kick in the â¥â¥â¥ cream and a Super Fat Dirty â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the face
1920	0	a	-no exit menu  -levels repetitive -do not buy this game  -its cheap but not worth it
3921	1	a	Its horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
5515	0	a	Paid money for this. liked the game.  check the price a few months later. Its free.  10/10 would pay 1$ again
2598	1	a	This game is great fun, I dont think it gets as much appreciation or attention as it probably should.
3015	1	a	I gave this game a yes only because Valve does not give us the option of a 'meh' or 'Decent' option. Let me go through this with you shall i? The game is loads of fun, if you are a fan of Killing Floor you will ADORE this game. If you love the art style of Halo and the feel of Halo you will ADORE this game. If you lik fast paced FPS games like Quake or Doom you will ADORE this game. It is all of these elements rolled into one with an added bonus of awesome DINOSAURS! However, perfection i not with out its hidden flaws.   These flaws have been reported as crashing upon starting the game or even just browsing for servers (wich thankfully i have yet to experiance though apparently it can be fixed by verifying game cache), the gun and other sound effects not loading up or working and finally (the one i am suffering through) Lag. Now there ae two types of lag to this game, regular internet lag (as i have seen most the people on here or the less populated servers you can access for play are foregin in nature IE im American and joining a primarily German server) but then theres graphical lag. This being the lag where you must lower the settings to the lowest or have major slow down. This issue is usually fixed by reducing the screen size but unfortunatly the resolution only gors to 1270x720 and no lower. The only way to truly fix this is if the resolution could go lower making it less of an issue to render and work the PC more. I have resorted to playing in windowed mode on 1270x720 but even then with alll the graphic settings set to low i lag HORRIBLY.   Outside of that tiny lag issue and bugs that can be patched the game is fun and offers hours of enjoyment and is a fun party game for survival mode. Highly recommended of a pick up but i would more or less wait till the bugs are ironed out (i believe the game isn't a full release yet not totally sure)   PICK IT UP AS I AM SURE THE .99c PRICE WILL CHANGE VERY SOON!
426	1	a	You grin with malignant satisfaction as you watch the Horde of Orcs slog through tar, pelted by arrows, dying in scores, whilst their numbers are also gradually being decimated by wall mounted blades, crushed by crushers, knowing that, should one of the kobolds manage to survive this, the lava awaits.  (cue maniacal laughter)  MUHUHAHAHA...!
4920	1	a	Ok, I finally figured out how to rig my settings up correctly so Mr.Thriller-Rex doesn't find me, so lets try this again. WITH FEELING!  Pros: -Dinosaurs -Vechicles -Jetpacks -Gameplay thats fun enough to make it worth a try -A.I. isn't just going to run after the objective or you, they actually have somewhat of a plan. -Did I mention a large selection of large maps for PvP, witch incorporate all the above elements into the gameplay? Cons: -All the guns feel the same -So do all the dinos -Not exactly understanding why my controler will randomly stop responding, but ok. -When you buy one thing from the shop, you get another. Verdict: Overall, if you want a fun game about shooting smartISH dinosaurs, with futuristic guns and jetpacks, this is your game, while I didn't get to play coop, I would probably reccomend playing though it with friends, and not random internet â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Best of luck to the developers, Luigifan.
5639	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.
1706	0	a	  To be honest, for a five hours to complete game its not that bad for a 2$ game, or 50 cents if you get this on sale.  Unfortunately, the description is kind of a lie.  I was not thinking at all about Yoshi's Island while playing this, granted there might be some similarities due to it being a 2D platformer, and the fact that you have to go through all the levels of the game. The reason is because yoshi's Island was at best a platformer to anything else, and was loved by gamers because of its classic artstyle and the challenge that was always looming around.  Also, there were boss stages, which unlike in this game, where while it seemed to have built up to a boss it actually wasn't, and it just add more to how there is a lack of any tension to your journey. Really you're just strolling about and at best nobody would ever need to even check a walkthrough because the game is too simple with how you collect items, as secrets are pretty obvious.  That being said I'll give to the devs credit that the physics are definetly impressive and at times I was genuinely impressed with the possiblities they made with them. Sadly, the said potential is kind of locked for the current stage, and the mechanics are different for each of the four stages, basically giving you something new to work with only to be quickly abandoned. It's quite pointless if you ask me.  As for the 'hardcore', the only part that was a challenge was the last stage, only because there are no checkpoints where it feels like there should be, and I'm pretty sure its where you'd probably quit the game by that point, especially since up to this point the game was fair enough in its challenge, only to bombard you with tiny careful jumps along with deadly fall right at the end.  In addition, the only other difficult part is that sometimes puzzles become unbeatable because you might end up accidently throwing the blocks you essentialy need out of your reach, which I feel like they haven't thought it through, and it shows.  That being said, the story is not entirely bad (but sure as heck disappointing) and the graphics are fairly decent for an indie game...Too bad the game already crashed to me once (I think) and at some points did in fact got some major lag for such a minium req. game, and my PC isn't even high-end at best but can still run much bigger games which is why I assume the lag is on the dev's end, plus whenever a certain enemy explodes it seems to almost tear space and time as it glitches into black boxes everywhere...  But hey, if you want to waste 5 hours and dont mind wasting less than a dollar on sale go for it, although if you want to at least seem like you have a decent library of games on your steam account, then you should probably skip this, it's not really worth it.  On a quick note I checked one of the dev's blog. If you absolutely hate clifhangers then yeah stay away from this game. These guys ain't making a sequel, and sure as heck don't deserve any positive review just for that.
5150	1	a	Liquidy purified AIDS condensed into a mess. Took me 20 minutes untill I was searching up how to permanently remove it from my steam library. SUCC/10 Willl never achieve THICCness.
1726	1	a	It's kinda interestly made. It looks simple but it really isn't. Great job makers!
3629	1	a	!
3581	1	a	i recomanmend this game i played its beta thats why so i think its awsome i think u shoud try it thats all for now see ya :3 
244	1	a	Love this game! :D Got it for my B-day years ago.
4575	1	a	-1/10 Worst game ever. Not even worth 99p
5703	0	a	Plagiarism is no joke. Do not buy this game. The developers stole art from many other studios and do not deserve your money.
1921	0	a	Only for very young kids.
927	1	a	A great combination of strategy and real time FPS. Your maze making, and trap combinations will either save your bacon, or doom you to difficult last second battles against hoards of Orcs and other nasties. The balance is great, the visuals fresh and smooth, and thereâs more of a story than it first seems, (Cocky apprentice takes over for crotchety old wizard. How many times have we seen that right?) with actual character development. This is 'must buy' in my opinion.
2616	1	a	OK playing solo, awesome playing with friends. Great game, especially considering it's only $0.99. Heck, spend the extra $2 to get the 4-pack and send them to friends, it's worth it.
3382	1	a	Do you love COD zombies? Do you love to kill mobs of Dinosaurs? Do u love guns?  Then this game is great and very fun for you and friends.  Worth the price! Enjoy!
4370	1	a	this is an awsome game please make more of thease games there awsome
719	1	a	This game is HIGHLY addicting. If you're a fan of Tower Defense games then this is for you. You just want to see Orcs getting slaughtered by the thousands!!!
3809	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME! MUCH BETTER THAN DINO HORDE BEATDOWN! MUST BUY !   So people say that there can be zombies, Killer robots and Nuclear Bombs in Future Tech Warfare but... DINOSAURS!! HA!? Its Future Tech VS The Dinos . Humans Were weak against Dinos in stone age Now We stand on equal terms! Grab yer Gun And Friends And Kick some Dinos! I was playing yesterday And I punched A T REX when I was out of Ammo AND WOAH I KILLED IT! I PUNCHED A T REX AND IT DIED! THIS GAME IS EPIC! 3 AWESOME CARRIER ROLES AND LOADS OF DINOS AND IMBA GRAPHICS! I LOVE IT! YOU SHOULD TOO!
4042	1	a	This game's change soo much! Multiplayer with your friends is a blast. Killing the dinos is always soo satisfying!
5568	0	a	This game is like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ step child of the video game 'halo' and the old television series 'The land before time'. Aside from running around like a brain dead moron killing little foot, There's really nothing to do in this game. 10/10 would not recommend to a paleontologist.
2206	1	a	Great Game! Best game i have played in a long time, And it is better then some $60+ games! 10/10 would recommand it, Hours of fun!!
4599	0	a	Get to the chopper
1727	1	a	This game is intimate and funny. And the price is good and if you wait for a good deal you can buy it cheaper than 0,99â¬ but I think it is good price. And you can get trading cards.
4729	1	a	when I saw the game I fought it was bad, but when I started to play it. it was so awesome. Give it a TRY.
342	1	a	Theese
5351	1	a	Whilst its on offer YES GRAB IT for Â£1, totally worth it! For Â£10 or whatever its normal price... not so sure, but its definately fun blasting around with your mates shooting huge hordes of dinosaurs in the face.
4544	1	a	better than takedown 10/10
4020	1	a	Personally I don't like this game, just don't like it and I still want to recommend it anyway. L4D 2 is way better and I got it for free.  3/10
450	1	a	I haven't played many tower defense games (TF2 playing as engineer counts, right?), but this is the only one I've played that I've actually enjoyed. Tower defense from third person action-game perspective. Good times
3376	1	a	i recommend this gamne especially at co op
5689	0	a	PS2 graphics Scummy game dev
5956	0	a	A nice concept, but fails on execution. So-so graphics, unbalanced gameplay, nothing to help you learn the game, empty servers and super repetitive music. Feels more like an alpha or beta rather than a finished game.
4239	0	a	Dont understand why people are saying metacritic is wrong? The game is beyond broken, probably one of the worst games ive played. Rampage is the only game mode worth playing and thats just a flipping mess. The whole game is a mess, its in a sorry state and no update can fix this.  Its like the developers released a half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ alpha and said it was the finished product.
2371	1	a	What Jurassic Park could have been if it had a good director like Michael Bay.
1187	1	a	bought on sell for 1$, best deal ever. great fun for a 1$
2061	1	a	Hmmm about this game i see. Game is stable yet complicated at times. Person might have to figure out stuff by themselves even though the game mentions what to do its still not clear. It was a pack deal but the game is worth the money. I can play this for hours and not get bored
6074	1	a	Just started playing it, but I can already tell it's going to be a favorite. Cross all the best aspects of dinosaur-hunting games with the multiplayer of Halo, add weapon upgrades based on XP you collect from each wave, and many awesome vehicles that are fun to operate and totally devastating. The bosses (large dinosaurs) are challenging, but it's the small ones you'll forget about that will end you. Planning on losing a lot of hours making dinosaurs bleed. Can play alone, but multiplayer is the most fun.
1712	1	a	Fun game, quick to get the hang of, graphics and physics are smooth. Have not gotten very far in it yet but I actually look forward to playing again. 8/10
4840	1	a	Trash publishers; good game though
9	1	a	best of the best
687	1	a	A fun, cartoony, tower defense/FPS hybrid game. The controls are fluid and easy to pick up. There's a satisfaction that doesn't come with normal tower defense games where you just sit back and watch. If you liked Sanctum, this is better.
16	1	a	Runespell: Overture melds together classic RPG components with Windows Live's player-vs-player solitaire with poker. I obtained Runespell for free in a pile of coal during the Steam Holiday Sale 2011 event. Receiving the game for free, I simply assumed that Runespell was merely a terrible, no-name title that was not worth playing. It was not until the Summer 2013 that I truly realized what I had come across.  Runespell sports a great soundtrack with honestly a decent storyline. Often times, card games that try to incorporate RPG elements (or just a storyline) end up drowning out the added components with the basic mechanics the card game - Runespell does not do this. If you are a cards-only enthusiast, this may stray a little too far from those roots; if you are an RPG-only enthusaist, this may feel more like a card game. However, if you are willing try a game that can have both, Runespell: Overture is for you.  Verdict: While Runespell: Overture is far from a lump of coal turned into a diamond, but it is definitely a gem. Simply put, Runespell is a fun, player-vs-computer, RPG, solitaire, poker game - and it is done very well. The game is so enjoyable that I honestly look forward to a remake or sequel that would incorporated online cooperative and competitive gameplay features. While it is definitely not worth $10, the current sale of $2 at the time of this review is definitely worth looking into. Here you will find a game that successfully feels like an RPG, while feeling like a card game.
1532	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ will Blow your â¥â¥â¥â¥ off
3786	0	a	Now I haven't played this game in a few months, but it's still safe to say for me that this game might not be what you are looking for. Now some might say that for the low price, it is not that bad, but I think it is actually pretty dull and boring. The gameplay gets repedetive after only a few hours and there is almost no variety. For one there is a pretty big set of weapons, combined with multiple (I think 4) Perks, but they are just soooo boring, and there is almost no sense of progression to be seen anywhere, what is especially disappointing for me. The graphics aren't to bad, but just like everything else in the game, pretty dull. The dinosaur models are alright, and interesting, but again, the playing just gets repetetive quickly.
840	1	a	great single player game
2044	1	a	this game is pretty fun
2013	1	a	Didn't know what to expect from this game but it turns out that it wasn't that bad. For the price of $0.19 and being able to collect the steam cards makes this game definitely worth.
161	1	a	a nice little tower defense game with lots of gibs! only thing bad is no co-op.
2825	1	a	this game literally isnt worth any amount of anyones time not even for the price I got it...
5142	0	a	If you major in psychology than Spiral Game Studios is perfect subject for Dunning-Kruger effect study. So it might be worth your time - it's fun to watch, to read forums and to laugh at devs. Self-confidence boosted by vocal minority. Isn't that cute?  The game itself is not worth mentioning. It's your typical 'rip-off-everything' made by complete amateurs. Yeap, you may play it and even enjoy it... if you have absolutely no taste, your IQ is lower than 50, you are 6yo and it's the only game you have at the same time. And even in that case you'll be bored in a half an hour. So buy yourself some iOS game instead.
5363	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT COSTS 0.99 $ BETTER BUY JETPACK JOYRIDE OR ANGRY BIRDS OR WHATEVER JUST DONT SUPPORT THE CRAPY WORK OF THE DEVELOPERS
5757	0	a	...
1291	1	a	Pros  * Great gameplay, tight controls. * Tons of enemy and weapon variety. * Really satisfying combat, very meaty, natural and robust. * Really hard, start in normal difficulty.  Cons  * Checkpoints are few and far between, it's very frustrating to have to replay the last 20 minutes because you died near the end of the level. Sometimes the only checkpoint in a level is just before you get to the boss. * The game is cruel, if you die it gimps you by removing two ammo from your explosive weapons (you have three in total). It sucks because it often means you have to kill the boss without the often much needed help from grenades/mines/molotov, especially in hard mode.
576	1	a	Very fun and well made tower defense!
6435	1	a	So I have had this game in my inventory since it's first Orion release. Back then, I played the game, uninstalled. It was buggy, servers didn't run and they got called all tons of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  I was surprised it still even was on steam, but it was listed as a 'recently updated'. Figured I'd test it.   Oddly enough, ORION didn't pack their â¥â¥â¥â¥ and bailed, they fixed everything. This game is worth way more than a dollar. Way to turn â¥â¥â¥â¥ into gold.   &lt;insert generic saw santa get eaten by a t-rex 10/10 comment here&gt;
6045	0	a	Garbage not worth the $1.49 I payed for it.
6357	1	a	Paid 59p got Genaro-ed by a T-Rex  All joking aside this is a whole lot of fun Serious Sam meets Halo plus Jurassic Park.  Its not cutting edge graphics wise but it still looks good.  Literally just jump in and play.
1231	1	a	If you are debating whether to get the 1st or 2nd game, get the 2nd or the 2nd and the 1st. If you get both (get them on sale and it'll only be around $4 total), you get extra levels and DLC.   Also be warned that the first game has super high mouse sensitivity, so if you don't have a very small mousepad or super slow mouse DPI, get the 2nd game.
3642	1	a	Halo, with dinosaurs.
5570	0	a	this game gives me a cancer :3 dF
95	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
1957	0	a	After trying BEEP several times, I just could not find it interesting enough to continue. Its mechanics are unique and add a level of puzzling to its platforming, but the overall experience leaned toward being cumbersome and not particularly enjoyable. This is in contrast to Mario games from which it draws inspiration, where moving through the world is intrinsically entertaining. The average graphics and abscence of story give less meaning to the experience. It's a game I would play if there weren't much better ones, but there are.
4237	0	a	The only game I ever regretted buying for 99 cents.
5512	1	a	Left4Dead but with dinosaurs. 10/10 
6098	1	a	As â¥â¥â¥â¥ing silly as this game is I love it! The multiplayer action is fun and combo kills are rewarding and hilarious.   If you like L4D/L4D2 than pick this game up.   If you like killing tons of Dinosaurs from Tiny to Small get it!   If you don't want to disappoint Jeff Goldblum BUY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINO HORDE!
2282	1	a	Orion: Prelude is really not a bad game like the price would suggest. It deserves a lot more players in my opinion. Parts of it remind me of the original Halo. The graphics are of course better than the original Halo, but still slightly on the outdated side if you compare it to something like Battlefield 4. ALTHOUGH, atmospheric conditions in the maps are some of the best I've seen. Fog rolling in, sunlight and rain, frost on your visor, day fading to night and then to moonlight; it all looks really beautiful in this game. There is a bit of a cartoonish appearance to the maps but I kind of like that. There's a good amount of weapons to pick from. I suggest playing the Gun Game mode first to figure out the controls and weapons if this is your first time. Start your own Gun Game server if there aren't any, preferably with a friend, and people will usually join. There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.
1818	1	a	I skipped through the tutorial and didn't know what to do, so I ended up flying around the space map for 20 minutes before I found out what to do.  10/10

533	1	a	really a lot of fun if you like tower defence/shooter/'strategy' games
1596	1	a	Simple Tower Defense with two campaigns in WWII-Scenario, only 6 different turrets and endless attacking waves...but good for the meantime in either case.
2428	1	a	Quick review: This is 'Getting Attacked by Endless Impossible to Hit Flying Enemies: The Game'  Seriously. I can still hear the constant, endless, horrible screeching of the most annoying flying enemy I have ever encountered in a game. It's Cliff Racers from Morrowind all over again. I actually have fun playing this game despite the bugs, poor balancing, and lack luster presentation. It has charm, like B grade sci-fi. But those flying what-evers kill this game for me. The guns are so hilariously innaccurate that there is no way you can reliably hit them, forcing you to listen to their screeching while they peck away at your armor, bit by bit, harassing you to the point of insanity. Yes, my entire problem with the game is not the enumerable other issues that so many point out, but simply the fact that I spend the entire match beset on all sides by what amount to Cliff Racers. No one liked Cliff Racers. Not even the devs that made them.  If you like Cliff Racers, this game is for you. If you don't, then get the game when it's a dollar. Still worth playing with friends.
5236	0	a	it gets boring very fast
3201	1	a	A truly fascinating commentary on Muslim life, told through the eyes of a young Japanese man stranded in Antarctica following the death of his family by mass seppuku. What it lacks in visuals it makes up for in its terrific fighting mechanics, which require the player to mash not only X, but left trigger as well.  11/10. A masterpiece
2677	1	a	So much fun, so much god damn fun and violence and dinos all together.  When to buy this: If you like fun If you like more fun If you like killing stuf If you like running like a little girl If you like fun (yeah, again) If you like being chased by big â¥â¥â¥ dinos If you like shooting stuf If you like FPS (should be first, but all the other stuff is moar important)  When not to buy this: If you don't like fun If you don't like killing stuff If you don't like being chased by dinos If you don't like having a god damn lot of fun while killing â¥â¥â¥â¥ while being chased by dinos while having a lot of fun trying not to die. (there is no syntax error on this sentence, read it right and you will understand what it says)  Ahcro.
3584	1	a	Greatest game ever you kill dinos and then you die the end. fantastic 10/10 nothing compares buy now
5289	0	a	As someone once said 'If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything'. 10/10 IGN 'Didn't like the dinos'
4074	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
5080	1	a	It's cheap, runs smoothly, has servers running, some always populated, can play alone with bots to learn the game, LOTS of game modes, looks pretty awesome, sounds are good to okay, BIG maps, everything is customizable, has full X360 for Windows pad support, you can remap all controls on mouse+KB, or controller, did I meantion it's cheap??? A very under-rated game IMO, if more people played it, it could become popular, these guys did a good job with this game, My only gripe is 'some of the dinos are SO tiny/hard to shoot, but mele works okay on them (maybe they're baby dinos)'... everything else about this game save a few sound effects is awesome!
1662	0	a	I did not enjoy this game at all.
113	1	a	It's like Puzzlequest with poker! Or if you haven't played that, it's like versus poker!
5366	0	a	A good Idea with the Carnivores-meets-CoD concept (anybody old enough to rememeber WizardWorks' hunting games?); but it's just too buggy and unstable. It kept CTD'ing and the interface is also a little irritating. I deleted it litterally minutes after I DL'd it. Even though it is only US $.99 I'm glad I caught it on free weekend. Even 99 cents would feel like a sickening,terrible waste on such an unstable (and if you ask me, obsolescent looking) waste of 8 gb of storage.
3939	1	a	Its 99 cents, and its okay. I wouldn't say its bad, but could be better.
4304	1	a	This game has had some improvements, ignore metacritics, its being constantly updated. The only problem I have is micro transactions. 8/10
4919	1	a	some pretty fun co-op for a buck.  
2683	1	a	Got the game as a gift, started playing seriously a couple weeks ago.  Played as assault class, purchased perk to get other class adrenaline weapons.  Roll in the final round with 2 pistols, 2 LMG, double grenades, and a Gattling gun. Mow down three large dinosaurs with the pistols and the grenades. Pull out both LMG's, take down the Crocodile looking motherf*****. *Morph into Hank Hill* 'That T-Rex is always throwing rocks at me. I think I'll go over there and gvie it a piece of my mind.' *Pull out gattling gun* *Put five hundred rounds into the T-Rex's head* 'There we go, Bobby. He ain't gonna be throwing no more rocks. I taught him a lesson.' The whole place explodes as I Matrix walk out of the canyon.   -Directed by Michael Bay
1808	1	a	20 cent game entertained me for 6 minutes!   10/10
5297	0	a	This game is terrible. On release it felt like an Unreal Tournament 3 mod but a very incomplete one, and now it is full of content, still feels like an unpolished UT3 mod. I'd give it 3/10. Not worth it. It has potential but needs a lot more work.
3114	1	a	awesome game get it while the special last, you will be hooked trust me.
5784	1	a	Fun with friends
3112	1	a	You can quickscope trexs and ride Choppers while running around with a lightsaber.  You get a game that's better than battlefront. All for 99 cents.
97	1	a	Although Runespell has a bit of grinding to level up and earn money, the game is really well done. You'll understand the game immediately if you know poker.
707	1	a	Great tower defense, but it may get repetitive.  Rating: âââââ 
839	1	a	What do you get when you combine tower defense and action? Here it is - Orcs Must Die! An innovative twist to tower denfence genre is what you can look forward here. The use of a variety of traps and your action skills are a must to survive each wave of orcs. It's comical to watch how the orcs suffer from your well placed traps, flying through the air and meeting to their ultimate end with a lovely Ode to Joy BGM as the icing (BGM imagined in your head). And you can unlock gifts in Orcs Must Die 2 if you have Orcs Must Die. Surely a must have for those who love tower defence with a sadistic sense of humor. =)
1126	1	a	Low price but hours of fun. Great game! 3D tower defense category with lot of very original traps and action!
1304	1	a	If you enjoy retrostyle sidescrollers with a modern feel, along with some dark humor and awesome game mechanics then this is for you. I've been playing this game since it came out in 2012 and I've been playing it since. Before this I used to play the first Shank. I usually play on the PS3, but this is for my gaming on the go =P
3982	1	a	Reminds me of Halo back when Halo was fun and had dinosaurs in it.
2794	1	a	If you didn't get this game when it was a dollar you really missed out. Honestly, i would have been more than happy to pay the full $15 for it. i put off actually loading this game and trying because of the low, low meta score, but you need to ignore the **** outta that number until they re-evaluate this gem. I reminds me of halo 1 charcter, vehicle and world design but on a much bigger bigger scale and more polish. it has a solid perk and weapon purchase sytem in game and a meta loadout your unlocking those same perks for you to use in matchmaking. and too top it all of ive hardly experienced any framerate drops, but ive been playing on med graphics when alone and low when online. All in all, on of the best multiplayer games if your lookin to have fun with a group of friends.
4914	1	a	dirt cheap for dirt gameplay
1362	1	a	2D brawler with sense of humor. Kick some â¥â¥â¥'s with this very well made game.
2307	1	a	Dinosaur shapes , chef boyardee ~ DINOSAURS! ~
2189	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
5290	1	a	Driving people to death for 60 cents , totally worth it.
5120	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
3217	1	a	sick game love the environments, game could change, when everyone dies on a specific wave, they just restart that wave and not a hol new game.
810	1	a	Loads of Orcs, Traps, and Maps make for a great 'Tower Defense' style game. The game doesn't take itself seriously at all which makes it even more fun &amp; the cartoon-ish Art Style gives the added benefit of some pretty awsome Death Faces on the Orcs! Go for it, especially on Sale!
2548	1	a	I would like to take your time to say...that this game...is only fun with friends and if you do it by yourself...  Well how do you feel when you touch your pee pee while looking at random images?
2952	1	a	i punched a T-rex in the balls  10/10  would punch again
1777	1	a	Made by the people who brought you such games as: BUZZ, LOUD SOUND, and the adult swim website as a whole   BUY IT NOW
5928	1	a	Cheap, fun, tones of guns and you get to to kill Santa Claus 10/10
3158	1	a	This game is the funnest game i have ever played!
3134	1	a	A game with derpy dinosaurs? HELL YEAH!
2033	1	a	I do recommend this game.
5146	0	a	Well, the system requirments are way off. I have a AMD Phenom 2 970 Quard @ 2.2GHZ 4 GB DDR3 and an ATI HD 4250 with 256 MB. When I checked the specs on this, my system should have been able to play this. All settings to low ... still lags very badley.
826	1	a	This game is really fresh and original. Everything about it is great. Highly recommend it!
1329	1	a	Klei done it again! I love Shank 1 even with all the hate.. Shank 2 follow the mechanics that made his predecesor fun and bring a new level to it! Lots of achivements, hard game and a survival mode will keep you sweating your controller!
5301	0	a	10/10 Do not buy this pile of cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥, stinking sand eating, frogsniffing, tryhard, anal breeding prolapse.  
415	1	a	Perfect blend of third-person action and tower defense. Plus, you get to kill thousands of Orcs. Seriously, F*ck Orcs. They are like wanna be Hulks, and are about as smart as the Jersey Shore crew.
5457	1	a	Lol this is a joke, the game in its current state is worth NOTHING, i have faith though
4587	1	a	This game feels like halo 4
956	1	a	Orcs Must Die is pure fun. I've sunk over 40 hrs into this game and loved every minute of it. I really hope they make a sequel.
1328	1	a	'Shank is back!' From this words a new chapter of Shank's story has begun. After his revenge, Robert 'Shank' Torres returns to his homeland, to orphan house, where he was raised. But there are new threat. A military force called 'Militia' takes over everything what's left from destroyed narcotic cartels. Murder and kidnapping is spreading across the land. And now Shank wants to take care about this problem by his own style. The fighting system was completely remastered. Becomes more comfortable, more dynamic. New weapons and a large number of pickup weapons from baseball bat to various Miniguns and Grenade Launchers. 10/10 Plot is nice, but not so breathtaking as Shank 1. 9/10 Music and Sound - of course it's great. Music is epic, no doubt. 10/10 Graphics - more gore and blood)) 10/10 Cooperative in Shank 1 was showed by extra campaign. Shank 2 have a new mode for single and coop - Survival. Can you defend yourself and important ammo from enemies?  I have to say. It's a great comic-styled, dynamic and bloody slasher. 10/10
2947	1	a	This is the type of game you mess around in with your friends.
5848	1	a	Everything I wanted and more
5622	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
2148	1	a	Don't let the low MetaScore scare you away, this game is a blast to play! Ridiculous action, a fun mix of vehicles, weapons and enhancements, and cooperative team-based play. Also, freakin' dinosaurs!  It's well worth 99 cents, for sure, so grab it while it's still on sale if you don't already have it.
3714	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
3846	1	a	What else do you want in under a dollar?  the good: -cards -its cheap -plenty of modes  the bad: -graphics -optimization -empty servers most of the time  Score: 5.5/10
1322	1	a	I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.  My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.  There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on a sale.
3251	1	a	I avoided this game for months. When it became free to play, I got hooked. I don't think I can go back to CounterStrike after playing this. Too much fun with friends here. Not much to the game at all, and once you figure out how to counter, it gets extremely easy even on higher settings, but for some reason I'm hooked.
5029	1	a	I love this game even if my computer can barely handle all the awesomness, its like I'm choking on minor lag multikills with the adreneline weapons (my comp's fault not the game). I give this game a solid 10.
935	1	a	It's a great, fast-paced point(s) defense game with oodles of ways to dispatch your enemies! So spice!
6324	1	a	very nice game
1131	1	a	This is the kind of game that you can find yourself losing hours to because it is just so much fun to watch the carnage! A great combination of FPS and tower defense strategy, with a sense of humor that is rare in most games. From the first voice-over, it doesn't take itself too seriously and rather enjoys the absurd action for what it is. 
4916	1	a	I RECOMMEND THIS GAME! or mybe not? hehe
4530	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥/10
3600	1	a	funny game to play with friends
6362	1	a	Very cheap and its worth of its money. I truly recommend this game if you like FPS
335	1	a	Love this game, so much fun. Just buy it already.
3976	1	a	There is a $wagzilla, nuff said.  11/10
4770	0	a	Bought this game as a four-pack for some of my friends with amazing computers. NO ONE CAN RUN IT!
5929	1	a	I had so much fun with this game that I played 2 hours straight without knowing the f*cking objectives.  other than that the third person view is awkward as balls.  either way 8/10
5891	1	a	Survive waves of dinos. Different game modes with 3 different classes and a nice variety of enemies. Plenty of guns to choose from. A lil buggy but a solid game for a very cheap price. Such and underrated game.
6404	1	a	this game is...just fantastic. i'm trying to buy it, but it won't let me. i downloaded it for free off of steam, but i'd like to actually buy it and support you guys :P wat do
5930	1	a	awwrrrsome LAN Party Game!    Check it out!
844	1	a	More awesome than you could possibly imagine.

5493	1	a	1 dollar of shooting dinosaurs with jetpacks. buy it, after u buy bad rats, because they are great game.
5861	1	a	I was killed by invisible man with egg in his hands... best game evah !!  15/11 -IGN
2509	1	a	this game is awesome i cant wait to play it every day 
3417	1	a	Mmmmm i wouldnt say it's bad.. but i wouldnt call it that great either... servers need more workin on... other than that if u like hordes and hordes of crazed dinos chasin u then be my guest and get this game
3322	1	a	Rather fun game when you play this game with friends plus it was only 1 dollar yeah.
5705	0	a	Paying for a game that becomes f2p? its like guild wars 2 all over again. I'M HAVING FLASHBACKS
305	1	a	+1
3923	1	a	epic, addictive what more could you ask? everyone is concerned about graphics and detail games are ment to be games and fun and stuff
180	1	a	Really enjoyed playing this game.  Applying third person shooter with a tower defense element was like a match made in heaven with me, the variety of maps, weapons, traps and etc. really made for various types of strategies.  Absolute fun game and was one of the first games i completed for 100% achievements due to the amount of fun I had playing it =]
1413	1	a	Very fun and controller friendly, an overall decent button masher and I love it :D
173	1	a	A solid 7/5 this was probably how I got a rollie coastie headache. I'm sure though that this game will be fun. I promise.
5388	1	a	Really fun game specially with friends. Not the most extreme epic graphics and textures but the game is still very much fun all around. A must have as part of a LAN party pack.
862	1	a	Army of Darkness meets Plants vs. Zombies. Auf Englisch extrem gut!
5429	1	a	i bought this and now it's free to play!!!?? i just waste my $1 for this           but the gameplay is good
5831	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ seal, that's all.
6153	1	a	Got torn up by some velociraptors 10/10
6	1	a	This game was the first indie title on steam.... the dialogue is ridiquolous like when the villain said 'Bring me his pubes.
4700	1	a	nice coop shooting game, they made the graphics better even.. well worth the euro 
1213	1	a	I've never killed so many orcs in my life!
969	1	a	The combination of tower defense action and kickass music is what makes this game awesome!
1445	1	a	A very good game, cheap and easy to learn. The style of the games great and I love the gameplay. Controls are can be a little hard to get used to, but after the first 20 minutes or so you'll have them down. One of the few rare games when the 'Hard' mode is genuinely hard. Would recommend to all friends. 
1792	1	a	I doubt that there's any I could say about this game that it doesn't say about itself. Definitely worth grabbing while it's on sale.
3457	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
4596	0	a	Do you recommend this game? a big NO
4349	0	a	Where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do I begin? I have a machine capable of running this game on 60 FPS but it's so terribly optimized that it lags atrociously. I don't understand how this game could possibly have such high reviews. Even with such a low price on it, I still feel until it's optimized better I just can't suggest this game to anyone.
2641	1	a	You get to kill dinosaurs with big guns... and it costs less than a beer. So you get the idea.
4849	1	a	Very addicting!
3344	0	a	Bought it for 93% off, one dollar, and was still disappointed.  At least the sound track is good. That's really the only compliment.  PS: They have a cash shop where they sell taunts and other stuff that is majorly unrefined, and is a blatant attempt at your money.
4090	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5125	1	a	uhh i got this for free but now it's gone why?
1223	1	a	Achievement Hunter Review: An incredibly fun tower defense/third-person hybrid. Took me around 20 hours to 100% as the first game of its style that I've played.
6337	1	a	This is a good game...Except it â¥â¥â¥â¥in crashes randomly.... OIherwise it is a good game
3396	1	a	The support class has a bad â¥â¥â¥ black man voice. 10/10
2810	1	a	Orion Dino Horde, is basically HALOXKILLERDINOSAURSXGOODGAME. The game is fast paced with a couple ways to play. Three classes: Assault (Can Fly), Support (MEDIC!), and that one sexy female class that can go invisible. With rounds of dinos and lots of guns to play with, what could go wrong?
3151	1	a	Fun game if lacking a little polish in some areas, the Metacritic score is years out of date from many patches, updates, and free DLC added onto the game. It's greatly improved since the initial reviews and is pretty fun. A very big update is coming later in 2014 that will improve the game even more. If you picked this up during the $1.00 sale, congrats on a great deal!  Graphics: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 User Interface: 6/10 Replayability: 8/10 Innovation: 7/10  Overall: 7.7/10 Summary: Good game, great idea for a game. With some tweaks to the engine and a few more bug fixes Dino Horde will easily be an 8/10 game. 
6137	1	a	why have u not brought this already?!  Trust me, it's amazingly, fantastically, utterly, brilliant, over the top, fps, giggles a second fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.  Oh and you can eat people as a dino &lt;burp&gt;
2133	1	a	Really fun and fast-paced co-op game!  +focus on teamwork +decent graphics +plenty of game modes -sometimes lags when a lot of dinosaurs are in the area
134	1	a	Me: God please show me a good TD game. God: Ok son, take this game ''Orcs must die!'' Me: Thanks god.
2059	1	a	I don't like platformers, but sometimes... Damn it, sometimes i play games like BEEP much time.
3719	0	a	I personaly dont like it if its 1 â¬ then u buy it but no at full price bcs its always same kill 30 mini dinosaurs kill 1 gigant kill 30 minis kill 2 gigant and so on
3313	1	a	When i saw the meta score for this game i though it was bull dust. But this game has been so underestimated by the score beacuse of early scoring by meta. the Game is the MOST fun to have with freinds . Sure it has glitches But the graphics and the gameplay makeup for it all the way. The guns are all even when in pvp. this game is up there in my books for indie
1503	0	a	Crashes as soon as you log in, do not buy.
2864	1	a	My first experience of the game went something like this:  Waste loads of money on deciding which pistol I want (whilst not realising I can get a primary or secondary) Clicking more times that I ever have before in a panic to kill the dinos Hardly knowing what to do Dying within minutes 10/10 Would do again  If you didn't gather, my first experience was freaking amazing and I really found it enjoyable. I absolutely love it.
6360	1	a	Better than Dayz
646	1	a	Fun. Addicting. Fun achievements and significant skill level changes increase replay value.
2532	1	a	I'd recommend Orion: Dino Horde because the game's a good run for the money especially because it's only like a dollar right now. I've played this game for a few hours and while it gets a bit repetitive and isn't as challenging as I'd expected it to be, the game's fine. In my opinion, this game merges the FPS and dino elements together in a rather fine manner. The netcode isn't as smooth though and the game works best when you're playing with friends that are close-by, not with people across the world because the ping has a huge impact on the gameplay. In conclusion, the game's soild especially since it's available for only a dollar right now.
5287	1	a	Really !?!?!? Free To Play 
1116	1	a	Better as OMD 2. worth a price.
1990	1	a	REally fun game when you're bored and want to plau something
4958	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Cant customise jack â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the dinosaurs look like something my cat â¥â¥â¥â¥ out.  -69/100 wouldnt play again.  Even for 99c it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.
3723	0	a	Terrible texture,animation and model quality, 90% of servers are either lagging too much to be played at or empty/full of afk players, over 200 useless achievements which is probably the place where the budget went(kill 100,500,1000 enemies with 'insert weapon name here'). Not even worth your bandwidth, more-so your money. 2/10
5810	1	a	Hey doode? Want to go on a dino safari? Then jump in my jeep and go!   Seriously - it's the best Road Kill adventure that you mayhave in any game.  I pretty frakking gurantee you will lauch you pants off.  Also for this price, everyone who hates this game - I will run you over personally and take your hands!
3027	1	a	Recently purchased the 4-pack bundle for my friends and myself - I tried it out this weekend with a friend, it was tons of fun. Absolutely recommend it for play for fun casual gaming and spontaneous LAN-parties.  The full price seems a bit high, but if you can pick it up on sale it's really worth it - especially if you have a few friends to play with! Also, you fight dinos with big guns from a jetpack - what else do you need?!
5251	1	a	Halo... With Dinosaurs.
2925	1	a	ORION: Prelude is super glitchy and half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... but for some reason, it's really fun. It was $0.99 when I bought it... perfectly priced.   Buy a copy for each of your friends, have a stupid amount of fun playing with them and laughing at the game... don't ever play it again and still feel like it was money well spent.
3793	1	a	Got both my friends into a car, pressed shift (Turbo Boost) off a cliff, killed them, got an achievement. 10/10 would drive off cliff again.
3567	1	a	this game is great fun, shooting and being eaten by a dinosaur is amazing and for just a low price it is amazing.
2123	1	a	Considering the dark past, this game is well worth revisiting. The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept. A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.   ORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old. (Not a bad thing) I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list. There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched. But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer. With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game. With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on. It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish. And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you. Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?  Unfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.
4094	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
152	1	a	I have very fond memories of this funny and polished third-person tower defense game. Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.  The game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.  Aside from that, highly recommended game. If you've never played Orcs Must Die 2, get this one on sale and play it first, and see if you get as hooked as I did.
5845	1	a	I honestly thought it would be a bad game, but i have had a lot of fun so far in the few hours i have played this game. It is worth the 1$ and when you play with friends the experience is much much better.  Plus it is litterally ALL Zombie shooters like COD Zombies, Left 4 Dead, etc except with Futuristic weapons, vehicles and WITH FREAKING DINOSAURS!! Sometimes the game is a little glitchy, but it is nothing bad.  8.5/10
6011	1	a	bought for 99 cents, had fun with friends for a view hours. not enough content for more then 4 hours.
147	1	a	This game is quite simple: Shoot, slice and blow up all the orcs. Its a nice mix of TD and a medieval fighting game. WIth the talent-like choices you can personalise how you wanna play each level, going trap heavy, combat heavy or a mix. The story is not bad but is not the strong point. The funny coments you character makes sometimes are quite cool tho. 08/10!  Pros: - Kill orcs (need say more?) - Several diferent levels with diferent kinds of enemies - Choose how you wanna play (TD heavy or slash/shoot heavy) - Smart â¥â¥â¥ coments that can actualy make you giggle (maybe...)  Cons: - Not story rich - Could get repetitive (but really, killing orcs gets boring for you guys??)
2872	0	a	99c? Not worth it. Atleast I saved 14$ with the sale. After it I bought 14 packs of sour skittles with the other 14$ I burnt my mouth. That experience was better than this game. The game -1/10 the skittles 11/10.
6471	0	a	Animations suck. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ motion blur on the dinosoars. Bad quality sound Crappy UI yeah I think that's all.
3030	1	a	I didnt have much to lose, .74$ for a four pack for me and my friends(sale). I came out with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing game. it's a little clunky at first but god damn you'll enojoy this game.
6041	1	a	Very addicting
1521	0	a	The activation key doesnt even freaking work, this is bullcrap
1581	0	a	I like tower defense, but you can find much better than this. Not many towers, and it's of the type where your tower placement can't affect the enemy's path, so by the end of a stage you'll probably always be in a similar position of having all decent spaces filled with the same few towers. When infantry attacks they're so tiny you might not see them.
5949	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was ninety-nine cents! 0,99/0,99
5356	0	a	You really get what you pay for with this game.  The idea of shooting dinosaurs with future guns is a cool idea, I mean, its just plain bad-â¥â¥â¥! But this game really falls short of expectations,   Graphically, its very nice. And on top of that, it not too hard on the computer. The framerate is smooth. Textures are quite appealing to the eye.   Combat is overly repeditve. About 10 minutes of play, i got bored fairly bored.   Its hard to get into the game's lore. Like seriously, with a few minutes of play, you have no idea as to whats going on. Here are some of my un-answered questions; Where are we? Earth? Some other planet with Dinosaurs? Who are we? Are we human? Are we an alien race? Why are there dinosaurs here? If we have futuristic weapons, and we are fighting dinosaurs, what time are we in? Like seriously, there is nooooooo story what so ever. You have no idea whats going on.  Athsteically, it REALLY needs some work. The its seems that the sounds in the game are SUPER repetitive. For the HUGE amount of weapons there are in the game, they all sound the same! The cars in it literally sound like the have 1 or 2 gears. after you start driving for a good minute, the vehical sounds cut and loop. Its HORRIBLE. There are No sounds for the game what so ever. I mean, there are no birds chirping, no wind blowing, no waves, no NOTHING. You can only here the sound of your own foot steps. That mixed with the GIANT maps that are completly EMPTY, the game feels more empty than fallout 3!   The animations for the dinosaurs, are just terrible. They move sooooooooooooooo fast, but the look like they arent moving at ALL.   The econemy of the game is horribly broken. You either always have TOO much money, or have no money at all. This works horrbilly witht the difficulty. On easy, the cash flow is so mondain. Killing one thing gives you â¥â¥â¥-loads of money, so it makes it even easier because you have great guns. Then on medium or even hard, you never have money at all because you get little money, too many enemys, and you can never afford guns.   So far, its not the best game ive played. Ive heard that it used to be much, MUCH WORSE. But seriously, this is BETTER?  I strongly reqimend NOT to buy this game
963	1	a	very short, but sweet none the less  good balanced gameplay, strategy is used, but it could be expanded a lot
6180	1	a	this game is hard to get .-.
1145	1	a	Great fun and easily worth 14â¬ . Easy to play and just the right amount of challenge.
4494	1	a	Is good... Don't let those damn critics let you down... Give it a try for pete sakes! Though this review may not sound promosing, try it, play it, and then come here and try to prove me this game is a downfall.
2195	1	a	i love this game you must buy and play with me ^.^
2241	1	a	Ignore the metacritic score. It's freakin' awesome. I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.  In essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades. There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade. That's how they work though, accomplish an 'acheivement' and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the 'acheivement' granted you.  I won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun. Not to mention, look in their 'recent updates' area of thier Steam page: 'Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!' Read it. Enough said.  Buy this while on sale and you won't regret it. If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's 'Sales' section got me again.  It's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.  Buy it. Play it. You won't regret it. At least try the free 2 days!
4301	1	a	Great and Cheap for $1
2284	1	a	best game NA jimmy buy this right now u cok guzler
5871	0	a	It's fun for a bit but missing some content.
59	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
2069	1	a	Love these devs.  Not to often you see a dev making fun of themselves. 'In 2012... We released the worst game ever'    The game is pretty fun overall, glad i got it to support them :)
2901	1	a	like halo and wave defense had a baby, that had a pet dinosaur, that tried to eat the baby, too far?
1842	0	a	This game is pretty terrible to be fair. only paid for it to activate my steam account really wouldn't recommend unless mind numbingly boring is your kind of thing.
1240	1	a	This is where it all started, Orcs fighting rpg tower defence type of story yaq know.
957	1	a	This game can puzzle you since there are so many ways you can finish each level, but a good game nonetheless, I guess you can really test your creativity here. You better have a fast clicking ffinger because you're going to left click a lot lol.
3242	1	a	Suprisingly hilarious with friends, good for the $1 I spent on it. Don't expect variation and uniqueness.
1794	1	a	There's some nice, quirky puzzles here, but ultimately very little else but for me it still worth it in that cheap price
5688	0	a	I would rather masterbate with sandpaper and glass shards than play this game for 1 more minute.
519	1	a	'I really like the game, but I couldnât find the stupid cake.' a lot of fun with these game
4791	1	a	fun game i just need friends to play it with :(
6219	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ CAVITY OF TUMOR BREAD
5700	0	a	Rip 1$
5604	0	a	Buyers Beware!  This game isn't well optimized, it runs very slow even on low graphics. Everything is wrong, the servers are laggy, poor gameplay, it will consume every byte of ram and vram you have. Honestly the worst game I ever bought before.  My Specs: AMD A10 7850k 2GB vram (R7 Graphics) 16GB Ram 2133Mhz Windows 7 Ultimate
2368	1	a	ok, i can't beat around the bush here, this game is fun AND ONLY FUN with friends if you're a neckbeard loner lurker on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ then this game is the equivalent of having a dinosaur mug you for 15 dolans or 1 dolan if you got it during the sale, with friends you can make fun of how stupid and awful and dumb and fat and ugly and mean the game is together, unite people with the hatred that is this game. its fun with idiot pals 4/10
2246	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play Halo 3, or Borderlands but you were too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stingy? Well Orion Dino Horde is the game for you! Bungie, and 2k obviously stole many aspects from this game. Including the borderlands vehicle controls, the second wind, actions, and many other aspects from borderlands. Now on to the halo guns, textures, hornets, and character models. Great Game! This quote perfectly shows this game 'I paid $3.99 for this game, and its better than most of my other $60.00 games.
5683	0	a	best uninstall simulator 10/10 would uninstall again
4857	1	a	fun game and now its one doller i couldent resist :3 thx for changing the price.
3238	1	a	how much sorry?!!! 99p?!! Thats a great deal but the recent updates have made it worse than better. Sad times :( Still it's fun to play coop
2207	1	a	Old review was completely inaccurate and overly subjective, stating in a nutshell, 'this game has jetpacks and dinos what more could you want?' Actually, that was the review in its entirety. An honest review of this game would be that it is a stupid buggy mess, that has its moments, but even when it has those moments, they're a result of the game's utter lunacy. Put that on the box and quote me with it. That said, you'd think I hate the game. You couldn't be more wrong. ORION is to Transformers (Bay Films) as Matt Damon is to a heaping pile of fecal matter. What exactly that means, I'm not sure; and I really only thought through the first bit of that analogy, but what I'm getting at here is that ORION: Beatdown/Horde/Prelude/WorkingTitle is stupid fun. Even more stupid and even more fun with friends, and really its best described as Just a Good Time. Quote that too. It's fun.
3866	0	a	This is most likely the worst game i have ever played. I would literally need so many combinations of drugs just to tolerate the bugginess. Its legitimately horrible but its a great joke gift for friends.
363	1	a	OMD is an entertaining, furiously addictive mixture of 3rd person shooter and tower defense, with a splendid soundtrack that perfectly compliments the frantic action. You play as the rather dense but â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ure Warmage, who must defend the magical Rifts from untold numbers of marauding orcs, using an array of traps, guardians, spells and weapons. The main game of achieving a 5-skull rating (no orcs escaping, within a par-time) on all maps is a good challenge - which further fuels your abilities at large-scale orc maiming, as skulls can then be spent to upgrade your equipment. Slaying the hordes is plenty fun enough, however therein also lies a complex combo-system adding much further depth of play, where the more traps and their afflictions hit an orc, the higher the combo-points, thus making every map replayable to experiment and chase that higher score. Crisp graphics, great voicing, music, humour and still packed with pure, fun gameplay that's as good on a pad as with a mouse. Quality arcade action that's only surpassed by it's more content heavy sequel, yet still worth playing first.
883	1	a	One of my favourites in 2011
6475	0	a	It's fun the first few minutes, it's not a fun game to play and of course the game is $0.99 so I wouldn't compare it to other dinosaur-fps games like Turak or w/e. But It was fun, the bad part about is that the mouse sensitivity doesn't match with the menu options and in-game. And what that means is if my mouse sensitivity is fast in game, it'll be super slow while I'm in the options/menu screen and buy menu screen. Also once the bots discover the vehicles, that's all they'll use; All 3 will stay in the car and just drive around, sometime they'll stay still but most of the time they're just crusin' around. Which wasn't that helpful, but once again, this game is only partially fun if you play with friends. If you don't have a 'super computer,' or at least a decent computer, I don't recommend buying this game, because even on the lowest graphic settings, it'll still run really horribly. Also there's some parts in the game you get stuck in. This is all I've summed up from playing it for like 5-10 minutes, I would've played longer, but I had to disconnect because I got stuck twice, and couldn't get out without disconnecting and rejoining.
1459	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
5277	0	a	Terrible game play. Terrible graphics. Terrible music that makes want to vomit. All for 1 dollor.... If you want a game that will last for about 2 hours, go ahead. But if you though that this will be anywhere near decent, I'd suggest just pass
5428	1	a	Hi-tech guns, light sabers, jetpacks, invisibility cloak, and Dinosaurs. Killing Dinosaurs have never been this fun. Especially when youre with your friends or with a stranger.
5188	0	a	Good mechanics and graphics for a 1 dollar game, but too unpolished and unplayable.
2877	1	a	Don't trust the metacritic score, this game went through several mayor changes, and the score is based on a much older version. This game is amazingly fun to play with a bunch of friends, and extremely diverse too. You can cloak yourself to escape from a T-rex, get enough distance in a suped-up helicopter and unleash hell on this dino by means of overpowered laser rifle! Leveling up earns you cool rewards, and so does unlocking achievements. For this current price, buy the 4-pack and blast some dinos to bits.  There are enough game-modes to keep you entertained for days and enough maps and difficulty settings to challenge your strengths. You can even open up a vast world and conquer it completely, provided you don't die in the process. Seriously, this game is top, recommended out the wazoo!
5993	1	a	Minecraft 2: Jurassic park edition is an absoulety faithful remake of the origianal Just Cause. This is one of my absoulute favourite game and it is defininately worth 10$
4762	0	a	Why would you buy this? It's awful..  No really it's awful..  GFX are in line with PS2.. This is like one of those bad movies that's so bad it's good, cept nothing is good. Save your $ and buy something else.
3378	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
965	1	a	'WINNING' man this games so much fun it's a mix of pre strag and real time it's has some funny one linners.

2085	1	a	Open the door, get on the floor. Everybody walk the dinosaur
4654	1	a	ITS AWESOME YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT 
1683	1	a	Not a bad game actually. Definitely worth playing.  At first I thought the whole game was going to be too easy, but when things started to get a bit harder...I was like...'oh'. xD
5815	1	a	WOW. Just wow! I bought it for a friend and myself when it was only 50 cents. Honestly I just had waaaaaay more fun than many expensive games could ever give me. I [absolutely] recommend this game. Its easy to learn, its hard to master. Its managing your money for skills, weapons or vehicles, and when you die, you lose your bought skills and weapons, but the weapons are still at the place where you died. It's absolutely 100% impossible if you try this game alone. Luckily, there are many servers and different game mode. It also is very easy to setup a server yourself, that friends can join. I have never...EVER given a game higher than an 7. 9/10 for general 10/10 in my experience
6456	1	a	Today I rode a T-rex to my death while shooting other dinosaurs in the face. 10/10
2257	1	a	Didn't think I'd like this CS:GO-inspired kind of game, but oddly, the first time I loaded it up and played a little bit, it was like the first time I played Zombies. It's so simple yet addicting and for $0.49, no one can argue that price.
1601	1	a	It's OK. It's a basic Defense Tower game. You place machine guns , AA and cannons and upgrade them as you progress and unlock new weapons but not many. It would be great as a Facebook game but paying more than $3 for it would be kind of a ripoff since it's not very long. On the Game Scale from â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to Yoshi, I give it a Pippa.
3666	1	a	Lots of fun to play with friends but not many people play so the servers are kind of empty.  All in all though great game!
3360	1	a	Awesome game! one of the best in this genre!! just try it. 10/10
2538	1	a	For 1 dollar, it's damn worth it. Make sure you play on prehistorik settings (kinda like an advanced setting, where you can change more stuff) to get more experience faster.
4024	1	a	  Sure, it might not be the greatest game ever and there are some funny â¥â¥â¥ glitches at times. And sure, maybe there are many FPS games that are funner to play. And sure, maybe one of the dinosaurs i ended up looking inside of.  But you know what, i enjoyed the wackiness of this game and plus the developers seem to have no problem admitting the faults of the game either! So yeah, you could say this game grew on me....a LOT. I would highly recommend buying it since it's so cheap, but if you can't buy it, than maybe you could get a friend to gift it to you like mine did.
2111	1	a	Where can you go wrong with this game? It's very cheap and super fun. Honestly, I'd buy this game for $10 or even $20. I highly suggest trying it out or even getting the 4-pack so you can play with your friends. How disappointed can you get when it was only a dollar?  10/10 would watch friend be eaten again.
4378	1	a	thank god they lowered the price
6300	1	a	Its cheap, but for some reason its a ton of fun.
5020	1	a	Had a great fun in this game and will be playing more during next lans. So good lan game
3776	1	a	To be honest, when I first purchased this game in 2012, I didn't enjoy it. It seemed poorly optimized and a little too hectic. I chalked it up as a dollar lost and let it gather dust.   I came back to it in a 'what the hell, I've got nothing better to do' mood the other day, and holy cow, was it a world of difference in perspective. Everything was fluid, the gameplay was solid and intuitive, and everything ran without a hitch. Within minutes of joining the lobby I was cruising around manning a gun on the back of a jeep, blowing up tyrannosaurs with a rocket launcher, and mowing down hordes of raptors and compys with a laser sword. And I was having a blast doing it. Honestly, this seems a testament to an early access indie developer that cares about the feedback of the community. I probably wont log any more hours on prelude, as I just purchased Project and look forward to playing it.  
4283	0	a	I purchased this when it was still called 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'. It looked very promising. It turned out to be the worst game I had intended to buy.   If any difference came in 'Prelude' then it should be celebrated because changing literally anything about Beatdown is a positive.
5880	1	a	i played this game some time ago and from what i remember this game is awsome i played for 3-4 hours at a time
1005	1	a	This was a very well done action/defence game.   The game has a really nice art stlye and the graphics are nice. I just like the look of the game.  The gameplay Is fluid and well done. The controls are easy to learn. There is a good amount of traps and abilities for you to use on the vast amount of orcs you will be slaying.   Overall the game is fun. I would recommend giving the game a try.
66	1	a	A bit of poker mixed with a turn-based RPG feel. Overall, very addictive!
4636	1	a	GRATE GAEM I PLAI EVRI DAY AND I CREI EVRI TEIM. I qUIT MAH JOB TO PLAY THIS GMAE....SHREK IS LOUVE SHREK IS LIEFE...
3954	1	a	it is a video game 10/10
4118	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
2873	1	a	Although the animations are eh, and the movement is kinda laggy/jittery-ish, it's still a pretty fun game to play with friends. I had fun playing it :D
457	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a hell'o'va game. Its fun and frustrating, easy and challenging, you kick its â¥â¥â¥ or it will kick your â¥â¥â¥.   I totally recommend this game.
2669	1	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME EVER
2914	1	a	Killing floor with dinos and other game modes 10/10
1869	1	a	A pleasant enough little platofrmer worth getting on sale, maybe not full price. You will get an afternoons worth of enjoyment if you finish it in one sitting.   Gotten as part of the platformer bundle, this was one of the decent little gems within.
3355	1	a	This game gave my friend an existential crisis and made my eyes bleed. All for the low fee of 0.99â¬  10/10
669	1	a	Orcs Must Die! That is all that is to be said about this game it is amaze balls
262	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a tower defens / shooter video game.  I'm personal really big fan of this games. You not only try to defens yourself and the portal with traps and towers. Because you have the option to fight your own. Charcter has a small amount of upgrades and new weapons to unlock and choice. It's has a very big number of challanges to complete to clear the full game. Very nice to play alone.. and alone because there is no freaking multiplayer... for this buy part 2. Easy to control video game and playing it with a controller plays very nice.  No co-op multiplay still.. a must have game for the tower defense / shooter lovers. I give this game a 8/10.
914	1	a	This is the only tower defense game other than Revenge of the Titans that has held my interest for more than a few minutes. You'd think I'd like Sanctum better due to my preference for sci-fi over fantasy settings, but I couldn't get into Sanctum at all.
4446	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
4506	1	a	This game got a 36 for a metascore. Are you kidding me? This game does not deserve a 36. It's a great fps, and the different modes are really cool. The graphics arent great, and there are some bugs. I've gotten stuck in many rocks and stuff, and dinosaurs get stuck too. Also, the game should have bots. Sometimes i just feel like playing a team deathmatch, but i wanna play alone. But you can't. Your guy just stands there and it says waiting for players and every few minutes a dino will run by. However the game has some very cool features including many guns and upgrades. Plus, I bought the game for only 99 cents. It goes on sale all the time. In fact, as I'm writing this it's on sale 1.49. With a few updates it will definetly be worth the $15. I'm not sure it's there yet though. It's definetly worth $1 though. If it gets really cheap, you should try it. Some people love it, some hate it. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10, because it still needs a few changes in my opinion. But it's still fun the way it is.
2892	1	a	It's mindless fun. The game takes itself more seriously than it actually is and tries to be over-the-top awesome which is quite hilarious. :D  The developer's good 'track record' makes me very optimistic about the game's future because they turned a complete wreck (Dino Beatdown) into a decent game and promise to refine it in the future, not very typical of todays small - and big - developers.  It is worth the original 10,99E in my opinion while for others it may not, but if it's on sale be sure to give it a whirl.
5864	1	a	got this for me AND my friend for $1.60. very fun, you buy weapons and fight dinosaurs
3693	0	a	worst game in history
6094	0	a	Don't believe the hype! This game is still as crappy as ever. Even free, I regret that I even wasted the hard drive space on it. I normally don't write such scathing reviews, especially about indie titles because I loves me some indie development, but honestly, nothing good to say about this title.   Models = crap level design = uninspired crap skins = crap dinosaurs = unplayable crap Sound desgin = stock crap  This title is best relegated to the dustbin of Steamdom.
5552	0	a	Not only is this a mediocre game, but it's chuck full of stolen assets ontop of being rereleased three times.
4249	0	a	Do not buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
2208	1	a	Best game I've ever played in my life 11/10
2496	1	a	YES, What a friggin awesome game! The most fun multiplayer game i've played in a while! 10/10
1857	1	a	This is, in all honesty im completely serious this isn't even a joke, the best game I have ever played.
5071	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
6185	1	a	Well what can I say? For 0.79p this is the most fun I had for awhile. It works and it is fun. Go get it!!!
2742	1	a	i.... i dont know what i just played... where is my bleach stash.....
2037	1	a	Nice to travel in the galaxy xD
639	1	a	Orc and goblin oh my this is a fun tower defense game
691	1	a	Not only is it one of the best tower defense games ever, but you get to join in the action first-person. And there are so many ways to do it, the maps have a great deal of replay value. I've logged on 100+ hours already, and I'm not done yet.
6306	1	a	Just one of the best games on Steam, that's all. 
841	1	a	Who could find the killing of orcs en masse dissatisfying!? Not me, thatâs for sure. Thatâs why I liked this game very much. You will like it very much too.
4870	1	a	i mean it was $.99
6122	1	a	Bought It a long LONG time ago, Its still looks amazing and trust me, It Is amazing!
5572	0	a	Performance is god-awful. One day while playing, I began pulling 1 FPS. I can't fix this.  I have an R9 290 and an i5-6500. There is no reason for this crap.
2931	1	a	wow nc game price soo low many vehicles weapons to test and a tough game evry one should buy it i will give 9.5/10
4867	1	a	The video game equivilant of the dinosaur toy you buy from the 99 cent store as a kid: you can tell it's cheaply made, but you love playing with it anyway. Also, it was only 99 cents.
4518	1	a	ORION: Prelude is the best buck I've ever spent on Steam. That single dollar got me a game that's half Turok half Killing Floor with awesome weapons, fun perks, expansive maps, nearly ten different game modes, and offline bots. Admittedly there are still some glitches to mend and polish to apply, but for the dirt cheap price of the game, you get what you paid for and more! So what are you waiting for?  Purchase the game Download the game Launch the game Open the door Get on the floor Everybody kill the dinosaur
1737	1	a	BEEP is a game that pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with a $0.19 price tag, but this game really managed to grab my attention. Essentially you're contolling an endless fleet of robots that are exploring various planets and searching for 'matter'. At your disposal you have a gravity gun that allows you to manipulate objects as well as a machine gun for dealing with enemies and traps. In addition, you may find other tools to use on each planet, such as a rocket fueling pad that allows you to fly. Here are my overall thoughts:  Pros: -It controls very well for the most part. The gravity gun can have a few hiccups at times, but otherwise the game functions as intended. -The enemies and other obsticles give the game a bit of challenge, although the game is very forgiving with checkpoints, infinite lives, and no loss of collectibles upon death at the same time. -The puzzles that this game presents allow the player to be somewhat creative by allowing them to manipulate a majority of objects in the environment.  Cons: -The art style is very simple and not extremely detailed. The game's environments are, for the most part, plain. -The music is not very memorable. -Enemy placement forces the game to be played very slowly, but the game's forgiving nature provides no sense of urgency. Essentially this makes the game feel very slow at some points.  Overall, I would say that BEEP is definitely a good game for casual play. It can be rather relaxing, in fact. While it is rather simplistic and minimalistic, that adds a certain charm to its overall presentation, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it at its sale price, although at full price I'm on the fence.
4129	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
1698	1	a	dam funny game XD and 0.19â¬ on sale hard to say no to that, remind alot about Mario meets LocoRoco so a good mix but self dislike Mario and worth playing
6064	1	a	Great game to play with friends, survival game against dinosaurs? what more could you want
941	1	a	This game is awesome - I haven't had this much fun since my wife got her hair caught in the tumble dryer.
5773	1	a	I should by all means, not be enjoying myself.  The textures are quite subpar, GUI is of sketchy quality, animations when viewing another player is non existent, it still runs on DX9, and the list goes on and on and on.  But I can't bring myself to hate this game, it is just so much fun.   The idea of killing dinosaurs in a survival setting with teammates is absolutely great, and the gameplay is something I can't really describe with words other than fun incarnate. This is way more fun than it should be. Dare I say that this is more fun than most recent Call of Duty game, and when you consider that all of that is done at a very low price, this is a game that is worthy of being added to the Library.  Seriously, just buy it. It's cheap and it's a great game, what more do you want?
6019	1	a	Get to shoot dinos with futuristic weapons with ur friends. best few bucks i spent
4146	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced. The dinosaurs were photorealistic, but I guess you would expect that from a top quality studio like ummm... whoever makes this bloody game. 10/10 very good. btw i love the jurassic park movies if anyone has a spare copy of jurassic park 1 id be happy and id probably blow you. Lots of love Adolf Linkin.
4650	1	a	Amazing. Purely amazing. First i want to say, 93% off? That's freakin cheap. And i love it. I first played this yesterday for the 'limited time free game' thingie steam has. Instantly i checked the store page to see how much it costed. $0.99. Wow. Here is what i liked/didn't like about my experience.  PROS: Ya get to kill freakin dinosaurs with machine guns and rocket launchers! Great weapons (depsite being only about 25) Various gamemodes (There were only like 1 or 2 that i didn't like) Amazing concept, which was executed perfectly. Co-op PVP PVE Solo mode Slaughter mode (i freakin love it!) Play as a freakin dinosaur  CONS Single player is a bit too hard (so ya better have some friends) Could use more customization  Would i recommend this? Heck ya! i give this an 9/10 
4942	1	a	This game is so silly. Play it with your friends without any expectations and laugh at how bad everything is. Hint: grab a car and run over veloceraptors and watch their bodies fly into the stratosphere. I'd avoid ramming a triceritops, i did it once and my car exploded, jettisoning me into a mountain and my friend into another time zone, dead on impact.   Buy this game for a dollar and enjoy a few hours of fun with your friends, then never play it again.
5054	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
1652	1	a	This game is unmistakably a return to a time when video games were more raw, unfinished, and simple. That this game appears to have depth and complexity is itself an illusion. I can count on my fingers the number of new things you will encounter as you play through the levels. My first time, I went as low as level -40. I couldn't seem to figure it out and every time you die, you go down a level. But then I started over, and am currently stuck at around level 118. There is a room full of robots that shoot enough bullets to make a japanese top-down shooter choke, and so to get past it, I went 'inside' one of the enemies to try and disable it's weapons through giving it weaker powerups. Instead, now I am trapped inside of it by more crazy robots.  The way I got as far as I have was not actually through a whole lot of careful planning or picking the right items. Instead, I find that I progressed faster by running straight past or through things to the exit. Since when you die you automatically get one of your three 'power ups' replaced with about 6 life points, you can burn through those and get to the exit. But, having done this, I am now not strong enough to proceed.
3885	1	a	It's Borderlands, but with dinosaurs.
4775	1	a	I actually expected this game not to be good.. Boy was I wrong. I love this game with a passion. It's better than games I've payed 60 dollars for. It's really fun. &lt;3
2477	1	a	justawesome i just love blowing trexsbrains out in a airship and alson some multiplayer ffa action
2655	1	a	.50 cents on a sale to play hours of tons of gamemodes with friends. Sign me Up
25	0	a	This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.
5488	0	a	My friend bought this for me. Thank God I didn't waste any money, because this is literally â¥â¥â¥â¥. Constant lag, horrible graphics and gameplay, and more combined to make a literal pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that came from the developer's â¥â¥â¥. Oh wait, there was more than ONE developer? Jesus Christ, they must've gone and got the most autistic people they could find on the street, because this game sure seems like it.
5744	0	a	&gt; starts game &gt; ((wow the graphics are great)) &gt; no tutorial or hints &gt; finally figures out how to play &gt; starts private game with AI teammates &gt; is having fun for 3 minutes &gt; realizes game is extremely unbalanced and literally nothing is fair &gt; tries to give the game some growing room, hoping i'll learn to love it &gt; gets a vehicle &gt; pauses game to â¥â¥â¥â¥ &gt; unpauses &gt; vehicle blows up and my entire team is dead  -10/10 would play again
1671	1	a	This is a fun little game to just relax with for a while. Not much meat on the bones, but worth it over time
5976	1	a	Killed a huge â¥â¥â¥â¥ing spinosaurus with a ghetto lightsaber. 11/10
4178	0	a	What could have been an awesome game is ruined by bad performance and even worse FPS mechanics. It just isn't fun.  Verdict: PASS
4953	0	a	The game is bad. Probably one of the worst games I've played in many years. 0.5/10.
1565	1	a	iBomber Defense is another great casual game that adds to the classic defense tower strategy genre. Its gameplay is simple, yet complex as you try to survive through waves of enemies while trying to defend your base. The acheivements are challenging, but ensure plenty of fun replays to keep you going and defending.
300	1	a	Excellent Tower Defense with a 3rd person fighter twist. So addicting.
4977	0	a	No wonder this game didn't cost more than a dollar.
3708	0	a	The game is horrible. The idea is good, implementation is very bad. I wouldn't even pay the 99 cents because nobody plays it.
5501	1	a	only play this game if you are using a razer com...
4117	1	a	Dinosaur halo for $1? Why the hell not. Fun game, still a little rough around the edges though.
3744	0	a	Where do I start... well this first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The first game of the Halo franchise, it was released on November 15, 2001 as an exclusive launch title for the Xbox gaming system, and is considered the platform's 'killer app.' More than five million copies were sold worldwide by November 2005. Microsoft released versions of the game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2003, and the surrounding storyline was adapted and elaborated into a series of novels, comic books, and live action web shorts. The game was later released as an Xbox Original for download onto an Xbox 360 HDD.   5/10 only semi-enjoyable with friends. Other than that sucks major grunts ya feel me.
5023	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
1334	1	a	If you liked Shank 1, you gotta buy Shank 2. People often talk about the commands, I see no problem with them, of course they are more complicated, but you can rebind the keys, also, the most complex commands let you do more complex attacks, tricks and such, not to mention its another challenge to be added to the game, it isn't hard, but still very entertaining, the graphics are amazing, now heading to the Story. Most people say the story sucks, in fact, it does not, if you pay attention to the storyline, tips hidden in the levels themselves and the secrets(called rebel intel)you can know much better about the story, and it isn't a bad one, you can acctually understand what happened, what is going on and why. There are games with better storylines, but this one isn't a bad one, its just a matter of perception. You can unlock new characters that have an utility instead of just reskins. The weapons and Multiplayer mode are also very nice, I recommend that game.
3907	1	a	Game is a big surprise. Very engaging co-op. The dev took some serious â¥â¥â¥â¥ over this game when they rebranded it but it's a damn fun experience now. I'll be putting some hours into this with friends. Dont get it if you're a lonely man, but if you have lots of people to play with it's gonna eat up some hours.
1500	0	a	Badly optimised, significant loading times even on my high-end CPU despite such a simple game.  As far as gameplay goes it's a good concept but poorly executed, with minimal stealthing or thinking required.  On top of that - it requires ORIGIN.
1678	1	a	(B)rilliant (E)ntertaining (E)xcellent (P)latformer
5405	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.
979	1	a	Get this game. It's got a great art style, cartoony - but not excessively so, bloody - but not excessively so, and fun - excessively so (sic).   The DLC is worth every cent as well, the few new traps and spells are great fun, and the new missions are challenging as heck. Turn it up to Nightmare for additional fun and frustration.   This game makes me feel like the defense of Helms Deep, every single mission. It's you against hundreds, thousands of orcs. Cannot recommend this game enough.
2993	1	a	HIghly recommended for people looking to play team-based games, or just waiting to have fun with friends online.
5729	0	a	f this game it sucks so bad. this is not a 2016 game, the developers should go and â¥â¥â¥â¥in i duno.  but what i do know, is this game sucks. so that is my review i am 6 years old dont give me hate. im new to this thank you. im 6 years old. dont play this dumb stupid dumb dumb game it sucks and im 6 years old. i hate this stupid â¥â¥â¥ stupid dumb banana peel excuse for a game. i hate this game so much im 6. years young.
3247	1	a	do you want to see how it is in jurassic park with a Scifi twist then you would enjoy this game where you feel immersed with the first person view where your helmet visor freezes over from the snow or get's rain drops that blur your vision when its raining. I Recommend this game for the Co-Op modes it does have PvP modes but in my opinion they aren't as fun as working with your friends fending off dinos to protect your base.
4357	0	a	the shop is so bad and the overall of it is not fun and it is for like 5 secs and then it just gets so boring
1428	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
451	1	a	A neat game that I would recommend picking up on sale if you're looking at it. The overall quality is surprisingly polished and the game is challenging, particularly in Nightmare mode. Takes ~12 hours to complete in Normal mode and ~24 hours to complete in Nightmare mode.
2273	1	a	It may be a really cheesy game, but metascore is way too low. It has no outstanding features, but playing co-op (especially with friends) is a real blast!!!
2990	1	a	Billions of great experiences and action in a 1 dollar game! 
3980	1	a	A very fun game, and only for 1$!!! 
1317	1	a	I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.  My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.  There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on a sale.
4883	1	a	GET THIS GAME!!!! I have played this game for 100+ hrs over 2 accounts, lvl 29 and 39. and its only a dollar, so u dont have to spend forever saving up you money if you are younger.
5467	0	a	Stolen assets and multiple scandals.
1247	1	a	This game is not a casual game. OMD is deceptively challenging and ramps in difficulty pretty quickly in only a few levels; it's nothing rage inducing unless you are a perfectionist seeking a perfect skull score on each level (compare it to getting full stars in Angry Birds).   At it's core it's an ultra-competitive score attack arcade game and is best played as a marathon rather than in short bursts as you'll have time to warm up and eventually play at your best.   Pros: - Smooth gameplay - No spoonfeeding - Great balance between budgetting, planning, setting up traps and commencing the action - Replay value  Cons: The game has a number of annoyances but nothing worthy of including in this review. Simply put they could have tweaked certain things a bit more for my taste.  Note: If you don't have a strong fan for your PC be wary of overheating.
331	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an orc racism simulation. You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is 'Orcs Must Die!' It's not 'Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime' or 'Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense' or 'Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War' or anything like that. Replace 'Orcs' with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs. I give this game 13 out of 16 race riots.
2174	0	a	 https://encyclopedia   dramatica.se/The_Orion_Project 
5303	0	a	Bought the 4-pack to play with my friends, but this game is nearly unplayable and isn't worth the $0.3725 per copy I paid. It's also funny that the devs are accused of stealing assests and right in the trailer for the game it shows quotes saying that it is a combination of other properties as a positive XD
3970	1	a	Dinosaurs, space, vehicles etc. are all totally worth the price
1037	1	a	Extremely fun and addictive. Also a good way to improve your 'thinking outside the box'.
4699	0	a	boring game don't buy.......... :P
2031	1	a	6/10
2129	0	a	What can I say ? After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material. What a waste of time AND money.
3004	1	a	 Fun! Lots of fun and innovation right ahead!   + Awesome concept + Various types of dinosaurs + Alive community as hell + Usually has some good prizes + Lots of game types + Well made vehicles + Awesome potential  - Few and unbalanced classes - Relatively a few weapons - Not very known game - Sometimes you get p!ssed - Suggestions to make a perfect game   PROS   1. Awesome concept  When I first bought the game I thought like  dafuq am I buying? A game with a goal that is to kill dinosaurs? But wait, it's only R$1.50? I'll give it a try . And I liked it! A lot! The concept is fun, the teams have to be organized to survive the hordes of dinosaurs, that come from air or land. Although the graphics are not thaaaat good (they're only ' good ', not ' very god ', but that's not bad). Even though the dino-shooter game category is incresing, Orion is awesome and even if it's cheap it deserves a nice place in that place in that category.   2. Tons of different dinosaurs  The game itself has a lot of different dinosaurs, from different species and with different statuses: some are tank-ish, others are fast, others fly, others are so small that shooting them is way too difficult and etc. That's awesome! Bringing lots of types of dinos is truly a heavy thumbs up to the game, while other games lack in this topic, Orion is an absolutely  win  here.   3 Alive community  The community is alive, differently from other games and the devs are constantly open to discussion or sometimes they start contests or invite people to play with them, isn't that cool? I've seen lots and lots of games  (some good games, acutally)  that are with more than one year without free patches and are only 1,5 or two years in the market. This game's about 2.5 years until today being sold and is being constantly changed.   4. Usually has some good prizes  This topic is strongly related to topic 11, unfortunatedly. But everything has its good and bad sides! The good thing is that I've seen Orion with awesome prizes (85%, 90% off) a lot of times before actually buying it. I bought it with a heavy discount, 90% off if I'm right, and profited very well. It was actually better than a lot of games that I actually paid more and had less fun.   5. Game types  This topic is not as important as it should be since most of the shooter games -related to dinos or not- have this in common but since it's present in Orion it should be pointed, shouldn't it? Like many other games there are lots of game modes PvP, PvE, EvP, etc. It is a positive point so it has to be put here but nothing special.   6. Vehicles!  The vehicle types are cool! There are tanks, jet-motos, mechs, futuristic helicopters, jeeps, mechs and other types! The good things are not the vehicles themselves but the way you can use it. Even if the graphic's not that excellent there's always an animation of getting in and getting out, signal that  at least  the developers tried to make the game the most complete as they could. Other thing is that depending the place you are and enter the car, you can't drive or you can't shoot, that's a complete and wide thinking of placing the player in the most realistic ambient to the game. You can also get up on some vehicles while they're moving and they 'carry' you as long as you're on them. Of course that there are some necessary vehicles missing, like a two people mech and a 2-4 people helicopter but the game they way it is is not that bad :)   7. Awesome potential  Well, what can I say, this topic means it all. Yea, Orion has a huge potential, believe me or not, and it only depends on the developers. The ambient is nice, the dinos are annoying  (well, they're only doing their job, hah) , the vehicles are challenging, there are bosses  (with, let me say, are hard AS HELL to kill)  and a lot of other things that are differential to other games. This game's technically prepared to have any colossal upgrade that can greatly increase it's gaming experience, remember this.   CONS   8. Unbalanced classes  The game can have up to three classes only (assault, spy and medic -you probably know what they all do). But it lacks a LOT of classes, for example at least engineers, tanks, snipers, hunters, scouts, and ninjas/melee-handed  (anyway, call them the way you want)  are missing. Another bad thing is that every weapon is absolutely the same if used by  any  class, with means that, for example, if an assault player uses a machine gun they'll get the same damage output as a medic (which is NOT right, since the assault-dude is focused on hitting while the medic is focused on supporting). That's not right. The game could have at least an upgrade-tree, too, particular to each class. You can see some suggestions at topic 12.   9. Few weapons  The game has too few weapons in my opinion and they're all pretty much the same. They're all ballistic and the game's context is futuristical. Not that the game would need to have futuristical antimatter-weapons or black hole generators or portals, no. But at least some energy short range weapons, maybe some lasers, gauss rifles or 'dino-ECMs'? Maybe...?   10. What is Orion?  The game's not very known, maybe because the gaming industry is way too competitive, maybe because it was re-released twice I think, or even maybe because  the game has poor grades  [www.metacritic.com]  in a lot of sites and was poorly reviewed by a lot of critics (just see their grades). That's odd, I might say. If you see the Steam Store valuations  the game score is 74/100 . Anyway, despite the reason is, the game does not has a very good fame and that keeps pushing it down the gamer community, not only Steam.   11. You usually get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥  Most of the times when you're playing PvE games at medium difficulty or harder you have huge chances of getting killed, despite of the reason. But the point is that when you die you lose ALL (I repeat, ALL) of your character/weapon upgrades and weapons! FFS! I know the game's not meant to be easy but this kills the game sometimes, it's very common to see players leaving rooms after getting killed, making the survival task way harder than it normally is, unbalancing the game and making sometimes other players leave! If you buy this game be sure this will be a common thing to you!   12. It lacks a lot of good things that could absolutely make it a perfectly success game  The game's awesome but it lacks a lot of things that some other games have that make them more successful as Orion. Let's list them up here  who knows maybe a Spiral developer read them     Classes overhaul : The class system needs to be completely remade. Not that the ones who are in the game are bad, but because they're insufficient to fill all of the gaps the game lacks:[/tr][/tr]    Class  Duty    Assault  Shoot things at a fair range Can fly.    Spy  Master of disguise. Can turn invisible.    Medic  Can heal people up Has a +0.5 HP/sec regeneration aura (10 meters).    Engineers  Like techy stuff Can repair vehicles with his money but earn more money.    Tank-ishes  Have more armor. Better at close-ranged fighting.    Snipers  Snipe!    Hunters  Incredible damage with bows/crossbows. Can smell enemies    Scouts  Poke and run Can run faster with their futuristic armors.    Melee  Awesome damage with swords and knives. Can make enemies bleed!       Campaign    Bigger vehicles   More game modes   Profile passive skills   More dinosaurs! :D

140	1	a	Exellent twist on the tower defence games, allowing you to control a hero as the waves decend.  funny story easy to control (works with controller) cool puzzels (great challange, not sure if you reference this as a puzzel game) this one is single player, but adds a competitive edge with leader boards, beat your friends.  lots ot fun, would recommend it.
4871	1	a	Punched a rude T-Rex then a Pterodactyl tried to show me this really cool cloud and he dropped me, overall a very good looking and feeling game. A solid title worth picking up.
6003	1	a	IDFC why it have just 36/100 but its fun as hell...
2573	1	a	It's cheap and fun. You don't lose anything if you buy it.
2663	1	a	Orion dino horde is extremely fun and you will never get bored, servers are also very easy to make!
1341	1	a	you have knives. they have knives. knives.
6155	1	a	Great value for a great game, sure it has its problems but they are being fixed by the devs and the game only gets better as time goes on and for 79p you wonât find a game like it. Great graphics and a great selection of modes to play from Survival (Objective)  Slaughter (Duration), Rampage (Playable Dinosaurs), Prehistoric (Custom Variable).  As of this month the ORION: Prelude Developer SDK Beta is going to be released so the possibilities of what you can do is endless thanks to the steam workshop support.  Overall a good game and a great value, though don't let the low price put you of from buying this game as it is well worth it, there are plenty of reviews out about this game so I have kept my very brief but I give this game an 8.5 out of 10.
6047	0	a	this game is crap to play by yourself...maybe it would be fun with other people...
6340	1	a	It can be a little buggy and the framerate can get really bad, even with really good gear. However, it's a really great game, compared to what it used to be anyway. I would wait a little while for the developers to work on some minor bugs and stuff, but its cheap and fun
67	1	a	Short game, but interesting gameplay.
2188	1	a	Objectively this game is pretty bad, mainly because of the bad AI and stiff animations, but due to it being co-op, and it's crazy concept &amp; gameplay, it still manages to be loads of fun. The developers still update it, too, and so far every update has added something good.
6295	1	a	This is an edit to the bash I did on steam on this not being a single player game after I read it was and couldn't find single player after downloading.   There is a single player mode but more importantly, once I tound it and tried the game again, it was a lot of fun. There are things to bash steam for but this isn't one of them.  Don't tell anyone but, I'd a paid for this game. :)
4754	0	a	black screen at launch:(
565	1	a	For me this is the best first person / tower defense hybrid there is. Beats Sanctum IMO. Set the Standard.
4437	0	a	Worse the 'Day One: Garry's Incident'. Although the price it one dollar, dont buy it.
3273	1	a	You can be a futuristic guy or black guy or girl from the future and kill other guys/black guys/girls from the future or you can kill dinosaurs with your friends or alone. And you can wear hats. I got it for free and not gunna lie its pretty fun and entertaining if I've got time to pass (unlockables would be nice). I guess its worth it though. Buy it unless you're scared
5304	0	a	Ok, so ive had this game when it was first released as Orion: Dino Beatdown. The game then was not good. The game now is alright but still in no way good. It has been through multiple scandals and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t involving theft of other ips work and assests. Skins from Primal Carnage, taking the original despender from Natural Selection 2 and then â¥â¥â¥â¥ing the devs of NS2 over etc. Theres just been a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t with this company which renamed itself and this game. It isnt good, yes its a dollar but tbh its better off using that dollar to go buy a Mc Chicken from Mcdonalds or something.  The servers are laggy and the game isnt optimized great. Oh and there are microtransactions in the game as well so theres that and if i recall there is a helmet that is basically Boba Fett from starwars....Oh and the new activision DMCA which is legit on Activisions part. The game once upon a time had promise but now its just not even worth the Dollar. I think when i originally got the game it was more than a dollar as well so â¥â¥â¥â¥ to that.  TL:DR dont waste money on a bad game or a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ company even if its just a dollar.
4111	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
2304	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.... 
5734	1	a	  this game was shared with me [ AWESOME GAME ]
5642	0	a	DONT BUY THAT GAME  Why??? Because its the WORST game I ever played!!!  And, I must say, I never played a game and rated it bad!!!
6021	1	a	Great fun. The concept of shooting dinosaurs is kinda ridiculous but the game is really fun. I like the different classes and the wide range of weapons and skills. The vehciles like the mech are awesome too :)
5790	1	a	Find some friends, buy the four pack, you won't regret it!
6189	1	a	Cheep and a quick game to play. Fun with friends.
4264	0	a	Meh, it's incomplete, glitchy, ugly, and repetitive- but it can be fun for a couple hours, i think it'd be worth a dollar if you have friends willing to play it with you- but otherwise , it'll be just another game to become untouched in your library after the first couple plays or so
4960	0	a	Its like a vegas wedding that you cant remember
3468	1	a	Probably one of the worst games I own. This is the most fun I have had in a LONG time.
3497	1	a	To be completely honest this game really isnât that bad, it has become a better game than it was before. The graphics are decent, the music is great and the gameplay is pretty smooth and fun. The game still is a bit buggy but it is worth a buy in my opinion. 7/10
5641	0	a	paid for this game now its free nothing special for what i paid nothing at all while every one els gets it free devs suck lol
1242	1	a	Still one of the best 'tower defense' out there. Solid gameplay with equal hilarity to match. I highly recommend giving this game a shot :)
2076	1	a	360 noscoped a T-Rex for 0.49â¬ 10/10
2107	1	a	I'd buy that for a dollar... and I did!
2896	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, don't need many words, one of the best games i've ever played, i've been going back to origins since games do bore me alot nowadays and when i tried this game (without any prior knowledge of it's existence) it was such a wonderful experience i can't wait to play it again every time i come home, just try it, don't bother with the reviews, TRY IT!
3	1	a	Certainly one of the best uses of a skin cap in a game that I have seen! Nothing like rag doll martial arts.
6173	1	a	Really fun. IF you have friends to play it with.
1444	1	a	This is a decent, button-mashing time-waster. It's worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
3873	1	a	so a while back this game was on sale for 0.99 I loved Dinosaurs they were so cool, almost as cool at he game eets muchies 5/5 star game I mean if you wanted to be as cool as the FieryPepper, Definetely By this game! Now into the very detailed and serious review of Orion Dino Horde Like I said this game was 0.99$ when I purchased it Great Price and I LOVED DINOSAURS OMG PERFECT GAME.... thats what I thought, When I found out the point of the game was to fight off hordes OF â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOSAURS I WAS VERY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ OFF, I mean NO WONDER THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ING IS ALWAYS ON SALE IT SHOULD BE LOWERED TO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING 0.00$ â¥â¥â¥â¥, NO NOT EVEN -100$ THEY SHOULD PAY US TO PLAY THIS CRAP MY GAWD...
252	1	a	One of the best single player Action / Tower Defence games money can buy. Cheap and extremely fun, highly recomended.
3471	1	a	Best Game for under Â£1 Great fun pure bants
4005	1	a	This is an awesome game I really like the idea of the game but its a bit overpriced :D Recommended if the price drops
1700	1	a	Not bad for a fairly cheap game :)
3789	1	a	This game is far to fun to play. I do recommend this game. This game only COST .99, but it guys. It is worth it.
5201	0	a	Want my money back since now it's free and I paid like $4 for this game.
2005	1	a	Nice game for $0.11
5106	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
3919	0	a	heavly bugged and has no orginal content that isn't stolen from other games
833	1	a	Overall I did enjoy Orcs during the short time I spent with it, and it is a great game. However, it generally didn't stand out of the pack for me, and came at the end of a long winded era of tower defense games.
5912	1	a	Orion: prelude is very cheap game , but don't fool yourself saying if the game is cheap the gameplay is also cheap, no , it just doesn't happen to meet up in Orion: prelude, the game is very fun and I can see people are already addicted to it and it is just a great game.  For 1 dollar , you get minimum 140-160 hours of gameplay out of it , that's why I want to recommend this game , cheap price , long game. You won't find this aspect in most games in our days. I can ensure someone will play 200-300 hours... is it you ,reader? XD
2232	1	a	Definitely better than what the metacritic suggests. And for $1 right now... totally worth it. Get it while it lasts! Has the structure for replayability, especially with friends.  Edit: The previous was my inital reaction. A more detailed review to come.
6353	1	a	This Game is indeed fun to play if you play it with friends or one of the PvP modes. I doubt that there is a better game on steam for only 99 cents ;) Also it is remarkable how the developer is still updating this game! For fans of dinosaurs, FPS and randomness it is a must-have.
1828	1	a	I didn't expect much - after all, the game was just 19 cents. But nevertheless, I started playing and actually it's not bad. It's a lot like Super Mario Bros., but you're a robot that shoots rocks instead of a short, fat, Italian dude with a handlebar mustache. On sale I would definitely recommend it, but even a full price it's still pretty good.
4387	1	a	bought the game for 50c, got trading cards sold for for 80c. Profit :)
5652	0	a	bought the game, booted it up, joined a server and tried to move but it occasionally went to slow motion, and there was UNRELENTING RUBBER BANDING. it was so bad i could hardly move, i didnt want to move and i sertainly didnt want to play the game
4232	1	a	Cool
3440	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends
2430	1	a	This game is more of a 'so bad it's good' kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons.   Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.  In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.  All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.
1844	1	a	What the BEEP is this game?  jk it is pretty fun
1875	1	a	Beep is a fun lil game and u shud get it.
2867	1	a	Love this game!
1185	1	a	1 time i played i could not stop its like abc mouse if you have seen the comercials they say there child just can not stop and i can not stop so its a great game in all i just got a regular computer and its smoother than jazz.I love this game!!!!!!!  :) :)
1312	1	a	Is realy good game but,is hard,VERY HARD
5403	0	a	The idea sounded cool, so I tried it. I really can't get into it. The voices were annoying and I feel like the graphics on some things (rocks, grass, trees) are on an overkill level and I had to manually turn the graphics settings down. The is a solo mode but it's not a story mode, it's just a play with bots mode which I found disappointing because being new to the game I had no idea what I was doing. The gameplay is choppy at best. Sound quality is horrible for a FPS. My surround sound is pointless for this game because it doesn't seem to use it. Also, I kept getting dropped from servers. I would love to see this game redone (again) with the Unreal engine.
3930	1	a	You definently get more than you pay for with this game!
4422	1	a	Best 69 cent spent in my life.  Online FPS with many guns, upgrades, superpowers, vehicles and DINOSAURS!! The game is easy to get into, has nice graphics, is well optimized and most importantly, it is damn FUN!  9/10
1411	1	a	Like a great grindhouse action movie turned into a 2D platform. Just like its predecesor Shank 2 has been infused with awesome fighting mechanics, soaked in blood and sweat, and left to bake in the hot desert sun. As all sequels should be, Shank 2 turns everything up to 11, trumping its predecessor on all levels. Klei would only continue to outdo itself with Mark of the Ninja
4505	0	a	The frame rate is so low, it is unbelievable, I had an incredibly low resolution setting on, and on an I5 Processor Windows 7 Ultimate hardware and it was unplayable, my friend has a fully working operating Windows 10 Computer, his was still laggy, DO NOT BUY, laggy to hell.
5681	0	a	its finally free to play...
2431	1	a	Alot of fun for an odler game. Fun with friends and the ever so not safe for work chat and in game voip. Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3   My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.
2778	1	a	Would deffinately recomend this game! It plays a lot like borderlands and horde mode from gears of war. Really fun and challenging, especially with a couple of friends!
4630	1	a	Extremely fun with friends. Casual game that yet requires skill and team work.
1043	1	a	Tower Defence game that has a significant Third Person action combat. Just to give you a gauge of how much the action combat impacts the game, it usually makes up 1/4 to 1/3 of my kill count. Makes build and wait a thing of the past.
4497	0	a	One of the worst games I've played in a while. Worth about $1. Maybe. Player has one life and that's it. When you die you lose ALL progress. Every weapon you purchased, every augmentation and you start over at the beginning of the game. That's honestly worse than the arcade games I used to play in the 80'S. At least with those I could put in another quarter to continue.
3922	1	a	This game reminds me a lot of Killing Floor. Basicaly you face down waves of dinos, with the ocassional objective capture in the between, and jumbo dinos to fight off, all while protecting your base. Simply yet addicting. Totally the best $0.99 I ever spent :)  Loads of fun with friends and offers a good variety of classes (flighing, healing, &amp; stealth).
4900	0	a	Horrible game with horrible graphics... Also there are a lot of bugs for example sometimes its not showing that the gun firing effect while I m firing... Also graphic optimization is horrible as well and there is not goal on playing any map. This game do not deserve to play. Do not buy it and do not make some useless pc programmers rich...
896	1	a	A cool tower defense with a twist, namely first person shooter. this makes placing traps and countering waves from different points tougher, but it also lets you counter the ones that slip through. Relatively cool graphics with lots of blood and ork bodyparts doesnt hurt either.
248	1	a	Very addicting
102	1	a	A great game. It is a fantasy combat/ sorta RPG game. Combat is through Poker hands. Kind of like the Puzzlequest games. Same genre as Fairy Solitaire.
5027	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
2141	1	a	OH my gosh! Instead of buying that Mountain dew for $1.89 buy this instead, trust me its worth it! (Plus you shouldnt even be drinking Mountain dew...Its bad for you!) Ok to start off this review i'm gonna list some pros and cons for it below.  +PROS+ + Very affordable price + Beatiful visuals (Graphics) + Well made interfaces (Ex: Main menu, shop, in game HUD, all of its great really!) +Voice acting seems pretty good in my opinion + Different classes (their is 3 classes) +Has vehicles (Suck on that cod fans!) + Variety of guns (and are upgradable)  + Awesome devs (They admit the game was bad when it was first released and made it so much better) + Great multiplayer + Lots of maps and game modes + Even better deal when on sale (Dont even know how much lower the price could possibly go but it's great for you penny pinchers xD) +Has a uique art style mixed with dinos (Think Halo style mixed with Jurassic Park!) +Easy to make servers! and work well!  -CONS- - Has glitches (like most every other game also has. Very few are game breaking) - Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well) -Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!) -Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)  =Summary= Overall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after blowing out a dino's brains! Also fun to take your teams vehicle and drive off (without them) and listen to the glorious sound of 'TEAMMATE DOWN!' xD. If you are still hesitating what are you waiting for? You have nothing to lose, try it out!
3192	1	a	You may get what you pay for in terms of functionality but the game does seem to run ok with only minor issues, but I mean come on..dinosaurs..guns..JET PACKS what more do you want? lots of fun
51	0	a	Poker solitaire is simply boring
5167	1	a	YUP! THIS IS A DINOSAURS GAME!
1438	1	a	The follow up on Shank... also a good (side scrolling) brawler!
1228	1	a	so whats the point of this game you ask? duh. kill everything the combat? you just shoot and slice EVERYTHING you see thats soon-to-not-be-alive! the traps. omg the traps are sssssssssoooooooooo AWESOME at killing stuff!   ...but...   the story (sigh) the story in ssssssssssssooooooooo awful but this is still a great game so 9/10
4859	0	a	the game seems like its an amazing concept. but thats it. after 5 minutes in game i fell through the world 4 times, failed to buy guns, was thrown into a server with no explanation on the controls and was eaten by a dino twice. after which i figured out how to use my mic by going into options and was explained to by another newb how to buy guns. the next time i respawned i couldnt move or use in game chat. i havnt seen a game this buggy since i played CS 1.6 with a ping of 800 on dial up. the developers are just trying to boom support for their kickstarter which i hope they fail because they dont desserve to be in business with a game this buggy. i fear to even consider what it was 'before' they 'fixed it'   0 stars
162	1	a	FPS meets Defend-Your-Castle-style play. On top of fun and demanding gameplay, this game also has a fantastic soundtrack and a great sense of humor.
3804	1	a	But $h/t it was 99 cents.
5941	1	a	A good game if you like Halo and dino games.
6236	1	a	You get to kill dinosaurs with guns. Whats not fun about that?
771	1	a	Awesome tower defense game combined with a third person shooter. Super addicting!
2089	1	a	i quickscoped a T-Rex with an explosive arrow while my teammate crashed a V-Tol into its head  10/10 would crash again 
5975	1	a	Killing Floor with dinos...DINOOOOOOOS :D It hink its cool, worth a try. Nothing extra just to spend time if you are bored :D
3557	0	a	Abortion of a game.
2429	1	a	This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something. You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it. It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents. If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself. This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes. You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans. Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents. This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support. Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason. Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos? This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that. Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.
3665	1	a	Shockingly Good. Must Buy 2014-2015.
5327	1	a	I think this is the cheapest best game around
4353	1	a	An enjoyable way to pass time
5945	1	a	During the 2014 Winter Sale, I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends, and we had some of the most fun and hilarious moments we've had in a while. It's not too high quality of a game, but worth $1.00 (let alone $1.50 for a 4-pack during the sale)? Hell yeah.
2984	1	a	This game is solid. The price is right, even better when I picked it up for 49 cents. If you like shooting things and fighting dinosaurse you will enjoy this game. If you dont, get off my internet.
2710	1	a	Why spend $10+ on a game you will play for a few hours and quit. This game is only ~$0.99 and you can easly put 100+ hours into this game. Best bang for you buck end of story. Love this game. Highly recomended!
5844	0	a	I thought 'What the hell its 50 cents I can probably get an hour of fun out of it.' Boy was I wrong. I think that I'd get more enjoyment out of a 50 cent piece of bubble gum from the grocery store. It's that staggeringly bad. I decided to do a little research and found out that this game changes its name whenever reviews get bad.. Also, the only reason that it is as highly voted as it is is due to the fact that the developers spam the steam reviews with bots. Man this is just a pathetic excuse for a game. I don't even know where to start; so I won't... just trust me, you don't want this piece of sh*t anywhere near your computer. Go buy a piece of freaking bubble gum.
938	1	a	Until LvL 18 this game is quite ok. Then the difficulty level starts to rise without any sign or reason. A level that you cannot beat without looking into a guide on youtube or s.th. like that. Bad gameplay-design sucks. Game deinstalled. Not to recommend!
2317	1	a	Fun game for the price! I feel like I got my monies worth.
1833	1	a	This game is underrated,A LOT.This is one of the best puzzle games ive ever played in my life,its challenging!It combines outstaning graphics with amazing physics and hard puzzles! 9/10 would buy it (was gifted)
5640	0	a	These graphics are so garbage that it isn't even worth 1 mere cent. Let alone one dollar. 2012 game my â¥â¥â¥.
1947	0	a	Ugh waste of my money!
1753	1	a	This game is awsome! The level design is good and can be challenging at times. I love the sound affects from the chacters and the music. The game also has a lot of levels and will keep u busy for a LONG time.
5063	1	a	  I LOVE THIS GAME SHOUT OUT TO THE CREATORS IF YOU EVER MAKE A NEW GAME PLEASE MAKE IT AS COOL AS THIS ONE 
1168	1	a	If you watch the trailer you know what you are getting. Cartoonish entertainment and high speed action. If you like the trailer, you`ll like the game. At least I did
1738	1	a	A small and fun game to play a couple of minutes if youre bored of your current game. I bought it in a sale for les then 30 cents, so worth it.
4081	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
5237	0	a	Never thought I'd actually want $0.50 refund for anything.
4176	0	a	Lol besides the fact that they changed the games name...Its a pretty bad game
4675	1	a	This game reminds me of Turuk
4220	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. terrible port. if you want to play alone you're good. but if you want to play online, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. this game can't multiplayer very well.
85	1	a	Puzzle Quest gets into debt and tries to win a few games of poker.  But seriously though, good game and creating poker hands is a wonderful idea.
6466	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played for $1.  10/10
682	1	a	Already got it on the Xbox but had to buy it on PC as well. Besides the fact that it's so good I just want to throw money at these guys, I also prefer the prettier graphics on PC :D
4031	1	a	Picture a mix between starforge and killing floor, Ill be playing this for a long time
4099	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
5486	0	a	Graphics poor. Really bad game. Barely any good gameservers aswell...    Don't kill dinos please for the sake of me   
5826	1	a	Buy it! You can even byu it for friends! It seems weird at the beginning, but you will start to like it!
2895	1	a	BEST 0.99 CENT GAME EVER!  8 minutes ingame and already lovin it! A must get for all shooter fans!
2848	1	a	well well, let me see... after a long break i have returned to Orion: Dino Horde .. it's fun.. with the right people, the job get's done easily..   do note, if you're planning on hosting a game, have a powerfull CPU.. a 4-core core2 series cpu won't do the job in later rounds..
4121	1	a	Killing Dinosaurs,in one moment scary and adrenaline rush. Great MP Worth Price 9.9/10
1110	1	a	I bought this for the Steam Holiday Sale to do the achievement, and found that it was very fun to play. If you're looking for something a little less intenstive than Dungeon Defenders, this is your game.
5502	1	a	I downloaded this game just to feel the joy of uninstalling it. 10/10 would uninstall again. #Uninstallsimulator2015
5135	1	a	This game is fun, little old kind graphics but worth giving try, specially its just 1$ , for sure NOT waist of money !
304	1	a	When I play Orcs I feel my iq plummet like TV viewership around election time.  Building killboxes then listening to the orcs scream in pain brings tears to my eyes as I laugh at their terminal one-liners. I am a sick sick man.
2271	1	a	worse than cancer 10/10
3364	1	a	this is a good game. great to play with friends
3661	1	a	8/10
3660	1	a	Knife OP! Dinosaur stabbing simulator!   IGN: 11/10 worth the price.
1045	1	a	Almost no replayability and a pretty short game, but it was bloody fun.
2631	1	a	IS GUT GUT GAIM YIS
492	1	a	I have to recommend this just based on the hilarious dance animations the main character does after clearing a stage. Great tower defense game.
3012	1	a	It all started back in 2014, I got this game because my friends told me to. After playing it for the first time i was addictted and i started seeing the world was boring unless i was playing ORION Dino Horde, my life was centered around it. Ruined my life 10/10
5059	0	a	It's so bad -3/10
562	1	a	Great twist on tower defense! Funny too!
271	1	a	its a incredibly goooooood game
2070	1	a	The game is $1. You pay $1 dollar to play Halo, Killing Floor, and Quake at the same time. You also get a lightsaber. What's not to love?
5373	0	a	Can I have my money back?
3147	1	a	Great game for the price but don't expect more
2811	1	a	Amazing textures ... gotta get ur self indulge in it if u try this game
6031	1	a	For what this game lacks in graphics and dept, it makes up for it in fun and playability. It plays alot like Halo 2
674	1	a	Fast, fun and easy to pick up.
4835	1	a	I want a death match where a team is made ââup of dinosaurs
3137	0	a	its very expensive i dont think you should waste your money on this.
1302	1	a	The edgier version of Shank 1. The gameplay got some upgrade that is both good and bad (why would you leave out block just to give me more dodging moves when Shank 1 gave me both) and most of the game is just you killing people for no real reason so no good story that goes well with the gameplay this time around. This time the Co-op action was moved to a new mode called survival; in survival you'll have to kill whatever comes at you for 30 waves and thats all, no Co-op story mode this time. Shank 2 is an okay beat em up that loses points when compared to Shank 1 but works more than fine if you look it as a standalone game, get it if you want some mashy mashy gorey edgey action
3914	1	a	this is the wost game ever made
5224	0	a	Dino Horde pfft...... *whispers is not goood because i hvent played it* 
2772	1	a	It may be fun if we play with friends for a few hoursâ¦ but it may be not. There are many games fighting in the FPS genre, and it's very hard to find something worth highlighting in this one.
1292	1	a	Such a fantastic and affordable game. Great story lines with over the top action and mayhem! Harkens to the games on my yesteryears (I'm 40!) when you knew an epic boss battle was just around the corner! I discovered this game first and must go back to pay the original Shank. I can't wait! Full controller support is a bonus too. Highly recommended!
4880	1	a	THIS IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME ON SURFACE OF EARTH 
5284	1	a	Have some weird bugs and really lame shooting animations but other than that it's an okay game where you get to shoot dinosaurs with a bunch of other people.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkzAVf8x9_8 
5008	1	a	I got into a knife fight with a Triceratops and lost. 10/10 would play again.
1006	1	a	Fun, inventive tower defense with a wide variety of build paths--not just in terms of the towers and other defensive implements that you deploy, but also the RPG-like paths for upgrading your player character and your ability to participate in the defense first hand. Very satisfying, although the game's 'humor' wears thin almost immediately. Definitely pick this up on a fire sale if you enjoy novel takes on tower defense.
5814	1	a	Interesting Type Of Game
6193	1	a	The mechanics of this game are so broken, it's beautiful.
3528	1	a	this game is so cool i love it 
2261	1	a	Really laggy but the eleven minutes i could play were awesome!!! I love how the dinos teleport!!!
2035	1	a	Awesome platformer! You can jump, shoot at enemies and throw stuff (including the remains of the robots you destroy) at the baddies! I found it tough to move around with the keyboard and shoot and drag items with the mouse, but after you ge used, it's really good. I recommend this game to any platform fan!  ================  IncrÃ­vel jogo de plataforma! VocÃª pode pular, atirar os inimigos e segurar e jogar vÃ¡rias coisas no mapa (incluindo os destroÃ§os dos robÃ´s que vc destrÃ³i) e nos inimigos! Foi duro, no comeÃ§o, se mover com o teclado e atirar e segurar s objetos com o mouse, mas depois que vc se acostuma, fica show. Eu recomendo este jogo para qualquer fÃ£ de jogos de plataforma! :D
4015	1	a	Pretty fun party game
2453	1	a	Yeah, I have been playing games for years and years, and back in the day, games were fun, games were simple, and most of all games were FUN, specially with friends,this game while simple in its premise, has a lot of heart is fast paced, and is loads of fun, sure the meta critic is low, but that was its previous incarnation, not this one, this is a great article on the game check it out:   http://www.dsogaming.com/editorial/orion-dino-horde-controversy-let-the-battle-begin/   Besides what have you got to loose for a few dollars? this game gives you more bang for your buck than some AAA titles that I own, and even tho It might not be the most polished or graphically amazing game out there, it delivers, and brings home the pizza!  so dont hesitate, you will have fun, you will be surprised at the sheer madness of running around from killer dinos, and then jumping in a jetbike making a last second save, the gameplay has lots of emergent moments of pure madness, and in that you can see that the folks that made it has a vision, and above all know how to make a fun game.  Play it, you will be surprised! oh and it has a 5 star community you cant go wrong!  
333	1	a	Without a doubt, one of the finest and most engaging games out there.
5983	1	a	this game is one of the best games i have ever purchased on steam i compleatly love this game and any one who loves servival should get this, this game puts cod zombies servival in the same league no joke :D
4903	1	a	this is not a good game i have to say. but if you have a day off at work. maybe spend your spare time playing this.
1558	1	a	8/10 This isn't the  best  TD game on steam, but for the price it's great value. Don't expect plot or fancy looks or sounds, but you   DO   get a good long campaign and a few interesting challenges.
4295	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
527	1	a	I absolutely love this game! It clearly did not have a huge budget. There are no super expensive intros and the graphics are rather simple (but effective and not bad in any way). But it is the concept that is so much fun. Building traps for the Orcs to run into and get killed in the most hillarious of ways is incredibly satisfying. The dialogue and voice acting are well done. The music fits the theme (but is a bit repetitive). The animation is great. The story is funny. The hero is likeable. My only critique would be that it is a bit short if you paid the full price. It feels like the game only just started when it is already over. You really want to make use of the last few types of traps more often before the game ends. And I never really got to ues the Weavers that much either (there never really is that much money). I wished there had been more levels to explore this upgrade mechanic and the last few traps a bit more.  Because of its shortness, best wait until it is on sale.  8 out of 10
264	1	a	This game is just fun. The gameplay is straight forward yet offers complexity as well. It doesn't take itself too seriously (this should have been obvious from the get go). Overall a good game especially if you can pick it up on sale.
801	1	a	Similar to Sanctum, but more addictive with better presentation but no multiplayer. A bargain at any price under $15
1826	1	a	BEST 24 CENTS SPET IN MY LIFE :D GIVE A COOKIE TO THE DEVELOPER!
1735	1	a	Great game :D
6364	1	a	An excellent game in concept and execution that has animal welfare groups up in arms.   Basically think of this game as a combination of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer (with dinos instead of Reapers) as well as the vehicles of Unreal Tournament and you now have a solid idea what Orion Prelude is.   What should be noted here is the legendary effort by the developer to fix what was at first many years ago a broken and absolutely tyranno game. Orion Prelude is now a worthy addition to any gamer's library as well as for those who are looking for a FPS game that does not take itself seriously.  For added product longevity as well as serving as the single player content, Orion Prelude features bots in two of its many game play modes, this allows for offline/casual game play as well as for people to enjoy Orion Prelude many years into the future.
5747	1	a	great game for a cheap price.  a lot of map glitches and exploits.
922	1	a	Just another tower defense? Think again. This game is great, spamable crossbow, hack-and-slash, quick magic spells, orcs torn to pieces, sliced orcs, impailed orcs, burnt orcs, electrocuted orcs, orcs swimming in acid and lava pits, flying orcs, orcs flying into one another because of your catapults. This game is awesome and you can be too if you buy it. The only downside: it's with orcs.
72	0	a	I've played deeper mobile games. It plays like one of those touch screen dive bar games.  I'm a big fan of the weird RPG-Poker niche subgenre of games so I was pretty excited about this, but it lets down in every way possible.  This game is basically just a battle system, there is very little connecting fight to fight. Simplistic map and boringly presented text and portrait story. That would be fine if the battle system had anything going on... but it doesn't.  The battle system has an interesting idea buried in it, but nothing is done with it. All the magic in the game is just *DO X-Y Damage* *Block X points of Nature Damage* There is no cards for board or number or hand manipulation. This makes collecting cards seem pointless because none of them actually change your play style. The way you play your first battle is how you play your last. There is also zero consequences for death so battles have no tension.  As for the RPG mechanics... well there aren't really any. Your HP and MP go up at set story points and I guess you can choose to cast a spell that does X points fire damage or X points nature damage, but there is so little reason to bother I can't see why you would.   Story is okay, I guess, soundtrack is decent, but I can't imagine that being enough to get you through this mindless slog. If you ever thought 'I wish I had to click through a bunch of text between Freecell games' then this might be for you.
3635	1	a	Lam as â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't bother buying.
5438	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
6012	0	a	I've only been able to play 2 games. Almost every time I try to join a game it crashes.
5857	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game not even worth it graphics animations suck â¥â¥â¥, the dinosaurs move if they were robotic slow peaces of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. totally wouldnt even recommend the dumb game waste of time blow this game up &lt;.
5136	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ old dino shooter. cheap but gets boring quick
1752	1	a	Awesome little Yoshi's Island/Half Life platformer.
1	1	a	For the time, it was really good. I enjoy playing it now. There's something so satisfying about fighting ninjas with comical weapons, kickflying across the dojo, and unlocking everything just by telling the master that you like sticky rice.

2876	1	a	Very fun time killer with friends.
1864	1	a	it look a little weird at first, but it gets really addictive despites the kiddo like graphics
5197	0	a	Rewrite time! Although this game is, most definately, fixed from its Dino Horde days, the game is quite poorly optimised. I bought the four pack, and gave one copy away so I could play it with a friend. He managed to play it. I was getting 15 FPS on the title screen, and I was worried about the gameplay, so I went and set the graphical settings as low as they get. Me and my friend create and join a game. 8-10 FPS. Although I am not playing on a gaming PC, this could run Farming Simulator 15 (Not in my library I have it on disc) at a stable 40 FPS on medium graphics, Arkham asylum at 50 FPS on medium, PS2 at 20 FPS on low, and PVZ Garden warfare (Yes, I use origin as well as steam, hate if you will) at 30 on medium.   EXPLAIN YOUR OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS PLEASE!  My friend, who does have a custom built gaming PC that can run PS2 on ultra high at 200 FPS, said that the game was easily broken (A ton of glitching dinosaurs) and the vehicles were too OP.   I'm sure it can be fun... but it does not work well. 2/10.
2221	0	a	horribru

3763	1	a	To be honest the gfx arent the best and there are a few glitches in the animation but for the price you cant go wrong... its great fun and well worth it!
4420	1	a	Very good game overall. It has great graphics and a huge variety of game modes and playable characters. You can get levels, encouraging you to get higher and higher levels to get better. I think personally the music is great too. I'd have to say a 10/10.
5699	0	a	this game is garbage. the ai is bad and the teradactals are s op you usually die from them.Also the guns are garbage and the dinos are just focused on the genorator and if it goes offline you loose.  so dont waste the dollar this game is this game should be .0000000000000000001$
6386	1	a	Very fun little game! I still feel like it still doesnt feel fully polished but for only a dollar how could you go wrong! This game is ridicilously cheap for what it is. Im so glad the developers kept on pushing it after all this years and in all honesty I would be totally fine with paying even a bit more for this game.
5974	1	a	I liked it Great buy for 1$
1836	0	a	 It's boring, save your money  - even if BEEP were free, it wouldn't be worth your time.  BEEP feels like someone's first learning project in a game engine. The story is pointless, the mechanics are boring, the gameplay is too simple, and the art is bad. For example, BEEP can fire bullets at enemies and obstacles - that's cool, but what is the point in having an option to reload if you have infinite ammo anyway?  If this was a mobile game, my review would be different. BEEP is okay for throwing a few minutes into here and there, but as a computer game, entertainment feels forced and I quickly lost interest.
537	1	a	Good combination of tower defence, strategy and action. The levels are great and doesn't get me bored. I also recommend playing Orcs must die 2!.
6195	1	a	Orion may have started off as a bad game, but through time and effort, it's finally become a fun game.
2484	1	a	Epic 11* out of 10 i played free week and now i am going to buy it recomend for sure 'It implants Halo, Primal Carnage, Zombies and other games in to one whole dino action packed epic game for only Â£11.99!'
1129	1	a	Kill Orcs NOAW!!!!!!!!  Lovely game if you like some melee/range combat fused with traps. It's a bit of a tower defense if you ask me.
4241	0	a	bad copy of csgo and borderlands 2
406	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a dating simulator based on actual events, about a guy who lives in a castle and joins a shady online dating service. He then spends the rest of his life attempting to interview these would-be green suitors to find the love of his life. Sadly, his dates often rush the gates and fall victim to the castle's insanely jealous defense system. It's up to our fair prince to use his trusty Crossbow of Love and his Sword of Choosing to place that special touch on the suitors that meet his fancy, and who aren't grieviously injured by the castle.  All in all, I found this to be a very tragic tale, as well as a cautious reminder of the horrors of online dating. It's also a really great game, even if you don't usually happen to like historical-based dating simulators.
4507	0	a	Do NOT buy this game unless you have a very good gaming computer. I can normally run any game at 50-60 fps on good video settings. This game? Absolutely not. To get it to run at 60 fps, I have to make it look like it was made a looong time ago. At that point, all the intensity and excitement are pretty much gone, the tall grass blocks half your screen, and its pretty much just pointless to play. Worth the money but if you want a fps with dinosaurs, buy Dino D-Day.
3243	1	a	Played it for 10 minutes and got AIDS. Thanks Orion: Prelude! :)
2524	1	a	This game is tons of fun. 99 cents right now!!!
5579	0	a	They rerelease it under a new name when the rating drops. It's pretty crappy, but s*** it was 99 cents.
799	1	a	I played the crap out of this game on my friends xbox 360 and loved every minute of it.  Pros: Orcs Must Die is just witty, funny, entertaining, strategy driven tower defense with a 3rd person shooter slapped on top of it, utilitizing traps to push back hordes of orcs and other monsters . This game is just great 100%.  Cons: Honestly there is no cons to this game that I find worth mentioning.  Overall: 9.9/10 because on warmaster this game is intense.
3492	1	a	Nice game  good graphics
5791	1	a	Very fast pace, comes with bots (THANK GOD), would be extremely fun to play with a group of people, and it's on sale right now. Get this if you have an extra dollar. It's well worth it.
2815	1	a	Theres like dinos and guns and mechs and planes and â¥â¥â¥â¥
325	1	a	Good game !! but once completed its boringg D: ! Recommended
84	1	a	Solitaire with magic. Pretty fun. No online though.
270	1	a	This is one of very best tower defense game
6427	1	a	awesome game, my first playthrough was enjoyable and I will keep playing this game. definitely an awesome 'indie' type game that delivers.
2073	1	a	This game started as disaster with a good idea. With the newest Update a lot has changed and it needs a review from all the bad voters.... it tooks a while but the devs made the effort to finish their product (not like many other bigger studios out there) Worth gaming. Worth buying.  8/10
2092	1	a	This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, 'I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,' remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.
549	1	a	It is a good game, but you should skip it and go to #2.
3984	1	a	It was....a fun game with friends.
5750	1	a	This game is the best game ever made I r8 it 8/8
2644	1	a	I recomend it becaus its trully fun to blow stuff up especially when its alive though i would like to see more oprimizations for laptops and 'not so good' PCs.
2215	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
3499	1	a	One dollar and you will be addicted. This game is just so fun and simple to play. Team based fast paced shooter where you kill a bunch of dinosaurs. 11/10 a must have for everyone library for a simple dollar.
508	1	a	Great fun game! If you enjoy Tower Defence games, then you will like this!
5049	0	a	A big steamy 75 cents worth turd. There's nothing else to be said.
3001	1	a	It's a nice game, but if you dont got a friend to play with, you almost go SOLO. Not too much people playing.  8/10 play again.
214	1	a	PC Gamer is right. This game has a limited scope but within that scope it does it's thing extremely well. It's like an action puzzle, how to lay your traps and fight so that no orcs get through. The cartoony 3D environments are pretty and the variety of approaches to each scenario are a blast.
4608	0	a	Pretty damn horrible even after 60+ updates The audio oh god , Sounds like it was made by a retard Grahpics were ok it did render horribly gameplay was ok it could get fun but it was mostly boring  voice actors gave me ebola 3/10
2517	1	a	Running through the cannons shooting up a Raptor when all of a sudden a massive T-rex rears its ugly head from around the corner. I can see it staring deep into my eyes, I watch on as this massive beasts picks up a boulder with its jaws and throws it at me, I had no choice but to take it to the Knee like a real man, I was down. I watch on as the beast walks over to me, fear in my eyes, hate in his. He leans down, smells me then stands on my head. R.I.P  10/10 Will play again, &lt;3
4628	0	a	Not even worth 99 cence, this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pile of dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ topped with asscheeks
1843	0	a	boring
5231	0	a	this game is realy bad it doesant even deserve proper grammer
6278	0	a	Primal Carnage is ALOT better than this pile of ****.
413	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this, but the price was right, so I bought it. Fantastic game. I bought the DLC as well, which is not like me at all. Loving the game so far.
2948	1	a	It's fun. Pure, simple fun and the developers are really cool guys whose devotion really payed off.
3111	1	a	This game has the right plan, cheap games with good amount of stuff to do = good profit
3051	1	a	as good as my last joint
2436	1	a	It's less than Â£1/copy, with 4 copies for Â£2.... why wouldn't you buy it, even if it just sits in your libary as part of your collection.  The game doesn't run all too great, and feels very cheap/poor quality -hence the price- but if you want a game to play for just a few hours with some friends and have a laugh, this isn't a bad option.  It's a shame this game is the way it is and feels so cheap, I think it offers some really great ideas - jetpacking around fighting dinosours with a lightsabre style weapon, like what?!  People are complaining a lot about the company and their dodgey endeavors, I don't know too much about it, and frankly I don't really care to look it up. The game is so cheap, and has been for a while, why care about any of that lol.
4848	1	a	take jurassic park into your own disgusting neckbearded hands
5399	0	a	don't  just don't    Tip: IF YOU SEE A GAME WITH 'MIXED' THE CHANCES OF THAT GAME BEING â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS LIKE 87,25%
2118	1	a	All my life I trained to be a master pokemon trainer. But now I get to kill dinosaurs with big guns. Parents are very disappointed.  9/10 best game 2014  IGN.com ...   Had to call my doctor because erection lasted longer than four hours.
2998	1	a	Orion: Prelude. Where do I start with this game?  Orion: Prelude is an extremely fun experience, especially with friends. Having bought it in the early-ish stages of Orion: Dino Horde (what it was formerly called). I can say this along with everyone else: This game has improved loads since its initial release.  Let's start with the gameplay. Orion: Prelude feels alot like other wave-based survival games, but with dinosaurs. Pretty self explanatory. (There are also PvP gamemodes, but I haven't played them, I just bought this game for the co-op). However, the variety of maps and settings keep this game fresh, especially the fully customizable 'prehistoric' difficulty setting. The open world game mode (conquest) is great, and I still haven't fully explored the open world maps.  The visuals, simply put, are good. It's no Crysis 3, but everything looks really nice. The tasteful lighting and particle effects add to the atmosphere and overall feel of Orion: Prelude. However, the environments and such sometimes clash with the player models (the player models being the ones doing most of the clashing), making the game's graphics look imbalanced at times. Some of the animations are slightly mistimed. None of these are major issues though, and don't really affect the feel of Orion: Prelude. For the price, you just can't get visuals this good.  The soundtrack is excellent. My only complaint in this department is sometimes a song won't play all the way through before switching to another song, and the song-changing seems unrelated to what you are doing in the game.  Orion: Prelude is a great game. It's not without flaws, but I can definitely recommend it. For the price, this is probably the best game you can buy on Steam.
2986	1	a	I recommend this game for countless reasons   Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 respect for David Prassel 900000/10
1264	1	a	Overhead Mech Twin Stick Shooter with gorgeous graphics, bullet hell inspiration, coop and plenty of content. Leaderboards, 3 difficulty levels, cloud saves via Origin through Steam o_0 and an ace presentation. Picked this up in the EA 'indie' bundle and this one shooter is just about worth the cost of the whole bundle.

5248	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.
3594	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde doesn't look special at first glance. However, the gameplay is extremely fun and the developers CONSTANTLY add new content such as new game modes, new dinosaurs, new maps, and new weapons. Highly recommended.
6169	1	a	Most enjoyable game I've ever played! Killing dinos have never felt this epic :D
1809	1	a	I am a 18+ years old guy and I play this game. Tell no one!
3865	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. Could it get better?
2703	1	a	Get in the car Ram the T-Rex The car flies in the air 10DINOS/10  
3880	0	a	This game has potential.. to bad the controls are all wonky and bugged. .99$ meh...
6332	1	a	This game is very good.If you want to shoot dinos and play with friends.Here's a game for you. :3
958	1	a	Fun as hell and addictive. The voiceovers are great too with the right amount of humor.
4480	1	a	Its awesome and worth the money! I have not bought it but I will try to as soon as I get the money. I have this far only played it when it has been free.
1099	1	a	A very amusing and well conceived strategy defense game. Definitely ranks highly on satisfaction. Nothing better than killing thousands and thousands of orcs in very non-repetitive scenarios.
2940	1	a	This games just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.
2378	1	a	After wading into this game with unceremoniously low expectations and a halfish-hour of actual game time solo (the rest was toying with tweaks to get some enhancements working), I can at least say my expectations were met and there is a decent game underneath this. Disregarding the, um, troubled history that I found out after. Sure, there's no tutorial, motion blur is apparently not working, the trailer is an amateur looking montage of gameplay with quotes from who knows where, the animation is abyssmally 1999 (a F- I'd say), the visuals are some sort of bland thing reminding me of Serious Sam 2 and Halo: Combat Evolved and the gameplay is a mix of older Unreal, current class based affairs and Halo gunplay and vehicular antics, but with DINOSAAAAURS. Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core. The HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game. It's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay. Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.
3416	1	a	'Just Do It' - Shia Labeouf
586	1	a	Fun game. can't say much for replay value as I didn't try to play it again ever. still worth one play through.
2293	1	a	Jetpacks, guns and dinosaurs. What more could you want? Tanks? yup, got that. Multiplayer? What else IS there? Fancy devouring the corpses of your vanquished foe? Got that.  Best game ever, 10/10
3904	1	a	There's just so MUCH to this game! Granted, it is all about killing dinosaurs, so if that's not your thing, this game will not be for you. BUT, if you DO like to kill hordes of dinos... You've found a game that I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy.   This is a great game to play with a group, though. Solo, you might find it slightly daunting. But come on, who's really going to take on a horde of dinos on their own? That's what I thought.
5286	1	a	It looked quote promising but its extremely barebones with ZERO community.   Is this game pre-early access or something?
5212	1	a	one of must have games...
2678	1	a	This game is certainly worth 10 cents.
2938	1	a	This is a great game if iÂ´m bored with tf2 and cs:go...And for just a buck
4787	1	a	Still Better Than Jurassic Park  I Like This
2319	1	a	At first this game didn't seem that apealing, but when I started eating it I kind of liked the taste.
4109	1	a	This is the greatest game ever made.
2580	1	a	I admit i HAD to give this game a try as soon as i noticed how the devs. mocked their own game, and hey it only costed me like 7 bucks to find a very enjoyable game, yes a poorly designed but fun game and i can only cheer the devs for the improvement they've made so far. With some more work this game could be a coop-dino-classic.  At first glance this game will simply remind you of Halo. The armors, vehicles and even the weapons must be inspired by Halo i must say.  This is a focused co-op wave-survival game which offers several difficulties and competitive modes such as Conquest, Deathmatch and a 5v5 where both teams need to protect a power generator while destroying the enemy's. Very fun.  Graphically the game does not offer anything new, i can be honest and tell you that this aint no eye-candy, at all. They seem old and poorly designed.  Right away you will notice clunky animations aswell. Robotic movements and weapons being held by thin air, dinosaurs that may disappear for a second while they chase your sorry-â¥â¥â¥ making it difficult to kill, specially the small ones.  Dont take me wrong, i really enjoyed this game for a couple of days nowadays i play it when i dont know what else to do and i still find it fun. Remember, like 7 bucks for a fun ride !!   If you are considering if this game is a go or a no-go, please do.
4068	1	a	spent 99c to buy this game.    it goes free 1 month later, rip asian cheap life
4691	1	a	its trash 
5328	1	a	That Game seems really bad but when u playing once its really fun
3333	1	a	trex scope acoos map 420\10 would rek dinosaurs again
6313	1	a	$1 on sale and a good game to mess around with friends for a few hours
3083	1	a	Meh..Nothing special.A few servers,and not much people are playing it.The game is fun doe.
3679	1	a	Let me start by saying when I first played Orion: Prelude (or whatever they were calling it) a year or so ago it was a terrible terrible game, and I really did not like it at all. Since then however Orion: Prelude has changed significantly with the updates it has gotten in the year or two since I first played it. It is at a state now were I can say that its no longer a 'bad game' per se just not one that I enjoy. By all means Orion: Prelude or whatever its called at the time you are reading this has gone from being a terrible empty mess to being a decent although somewhat mediocre Dino survival game. I still would not buy it myself, but for the price currently 0.99 cents I have got to say if you like the idea of a Dino survival game, this is worth looking into.    I myself still prefer Primal Carnage over Orion: prelude, and Dino D-Day is also another game I like significantly more than the Orion game. I even hear that game Stomping Land is pretty good, though I have yet to try that myself. All I have got to say in the end though is that you may like Orion: Prelude, it has come a long way since its (imo terrible) launch. Orion; Prelude may not be as good as the other games listed above (Primal Carnage, Dino D-Day, Stomping Land) but it is the cheapest, and that counts for something I guess. Orion: Prelude goes on sale all the time, so If you are interested I would get it during its next sale.
4659	1	a	Just got it, can't wait to play
5187	0	a	probably the worst game i played for 10 minutes
4946	1	a	Fun, addictive game.  Arcade style shooter (think Counter Strike) with Halo fascia, and damn it's fun!   Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 8/10 Sound 5/10 (I've heard the music in other games, hmm..) Addictive 10/10  I can't wait to try out Team Deathmatch modes too (I've only played 2 'wave' type gamemodes, MANY different game modes)
6211	1	a	tremendously great game!I tip to buy all perks if possible,get loads of cash,then buy a trek79lmg,a trek ion blade,a longshot and the full-auto shotgun!they never betrayed me!(sorry for potentially bad english)!also try to get as soon as possible in a VTOL,if there are veichle shops.
4851	1	a	dinosaurs for a dollar what not to buy
1681	1	a	Now THIS is a fun little platformer, adding little quirks to it that makes it just that little bit more unique. Now I'm not a big fan of platformers (except for the good old original mario games and a few rayman games) but I absolutely loved this one.  I like how you can fly your ship around and choose where you want to do. Just everything about it feels fresh, like a whole new spin on how platforming games are made.  You play as a robot with a variety of abilities, you can jump around, grab items, drag them around and do all sorts of things with them. You can even shoot if you want. But I like defeating enemies with gravity, it's amusing.  It's hard to describe the game without showing it, so definitely check out video footage of the game and see if it's for you. If you're a fan of platformers, you won't be disappointed with this game. If you're like me and you're not too much of a fan, give it a go if you can get this on the cheap, I was pleasantly surprised and you may be too. I recommend this game.
32	0	a	A good game in the beginning but later it gets boring and eventually even frustrating.
6421	1	a	this game is so fun, only 20 minutes into it then i loved it so much
1165	1	a	A great time consumer! Poor Orcs... Not! :) +like this game
5402	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
2883	1	a	This game is far the best dinosaur game i've been played, a good game to play with your friends.
5972	1	a	Orion is personally a great game except it can get really easy.  Pros : Well it has Dinosaurs Lots of Weapons Cool Vehichles  Cons : Too easy Assault is OP       If you are assault you can fly on a rock and win without dieing once 
2618	1	a	Getting grabbed by Pterodactyls never gets any easier.
3541	0	a	It's Left for Dead with dinosaurs. Except you're protecting a thing, and it takes too long to get to the thing from the shops.
4057	0	a	Im kinda angry that this went Free, but Im also not surprised. It feels like baby's first gaming project and a lot of the stuff in it just feels absolutely atrocious.  Good for drunken nights of fun with friends but just a mess of a game, I cant reccommend it.
1628	1	a	Puzzle game that has Storm flying around in a teacup, what else do you need to hear? Get it 8/10
6329	1	a	One of the best, if not the best co-op games I have played in my life. It is like Halo and Jurassic Park had a baby.
5393	1	a	Do not let the bad reviews and the terrible Metascore fool you. This game is awesome, no joke.  The bad reviews were carried over from their previous game, ORION: Dino Beatdown, which was buggy and unfinished.  My only gripe is that the animations are a bit awkward at times, but the gameplay is incredibly solid and loads of fun, especially with friends.  Besides, the base price is only â¬1, with the price dropping as low as â¬0,50 at times. Sell a few trading cards, and get this game!
3268	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
4149	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
3220	1	a	Saw this game for $1 so i bought it... 
3068	1	a	The game still needs work... like, a lot of work, but it's surprisingly fun, especially to play with friends!  Don't believe the Metacritic score. Buy a couple copies for you and your friends, and you're guaranteed some good times.  Just watch out for those baby dinosaurs. They'll bite your kneecaps off.
4207	0	a	Don't buy it. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on almost every level, and no where to be worth $8.99.  Bggest issues are sound cutting out, constant crashing, horrible and ugly UI, dumb AI, god awful animations for everything.. etc. Another reason not to buy is because the guy who created it is a crook.  That is all I have to say.
1414	1	a	Very fun and addicting!
2314	1	a	Pretty good game, I like getting the handheld minigun as support, and having the self healing as that class to is a teensy bit OP, and the start pistol is pretty OP for that too, but really good game overall
2164	1	a	Funny game, not as bad as people say it is.. when you get into a game, because there are some connection issues. But it's a fun co op game and if you can get it at a discount, I got it at 93% off, 0,99 â¬ you should get it. 
3302	1	a	The game has a excellent premis, but is about as polished as decaying squirel poop. It is becomming a much better game with every update, and its eventually comming out of it's shell as 'One of the worst games polluting The Steam Library'.  Its pretty original, unlike exploitation games like Revelation 2012, and it has allot of 'good seeds' in it, waiting to 'bare fruits'.   All in all, with the price in mind, its definitly worth it. And for a few hours of cheap, guilty fun with the potential of becomming a good game with time, I'd recommend it.
3066	1	a	I love it. Sadly we have to have a kickstarter for the Open World versioin and Im broke &gt;.&gt;
1538	1	a	Bloop! This game is adorable. Dunno why it didn't get more attention. The PC port isn't super great, but it works okay. Show it to your kids! They'll love it. Fun/5
4262	0	a	Do not buy this game. No matter the discount, it is not worth the price. There's too much to go into, and I really don't care much. Just noticed that for some reason I had a positive review on here, and since it's on sale wanted to update the review to reflect the current game.
4218	1	a	  Worth a dolla if u like killing hundreds of dinos + want trading cards and achievements! Fun to play with ur buddies
3551	1	a	Fly through the air with a jetpack cutting up T-Rexes with laser swords. 10/10
2897	1	a	10/10
6381	1	a	One of the best games you can get on sale for less than a dollar. It's enjoyable, entertaining, and amazing for coop with friends.
6081	0	a	A bad Halo knockoff with dinosaurs. Would've been nice to play humans vs dinosaurs with more than four people. 4 suicide bomber pterodactyls /10
5482	0	a	If you really need to look at negative reviews for a 99 cent game you probably shouldnt be playing videogames.
3915	1	a	really fun game!!! 1$ now so get it 
5873	1	a	There's no reason not to buy it when its not on sale. You shoot dinosaurs.
2372	0	a	Eh. Can't launch a game with a friend, that's kinda why i bought this :/ if this gets fixed i might change my mind. why release a game that has that many bugs?
4054	0	a	When you paid to get f2play game that feeling is priceless...
5323	0	a	the game sucks laggy crappy no story lame outdated graphics cant hear sound effects cheap weapons over powered dinsaurs dlc overprice you will die :)  i would not play this game with strangers or friends
3590	1	a	hey look this game is awesome man i really think this game is worth 15 dollars man
4482	1	a	FRICKING REDIC LAGG JHOLY CRAP IT TAAKES A WHOLE SECOND FOr MY MOUSE TO START TO FOLLOW MY MOVEMENTS EVEN WITH EVERYTHING DOWN ITS STILL SUPER SLOW! PLEASE FIX, as well as the controller support! 
5456	0	a	This game has some serious performance problems, to a laughable extent. Dinosaurs will float across the place and your gun can't really even move when you shoot it. Might be fun if you like buying games that are funny because they are bad.
6113	1	a	just look at it... how does that not look fun?
3109	1	a	This game was on a 93% off discount recently, going at 0.99 USD a piece. It's possible for me to fork out a single buck from my steam wallet after liquidating some of my items, so, why not?  The first thing you should know about this game is that, there is a reason why it's score is 36/100. Yes, this game is crudely made and, in most manner, buggy, but that does not mean that this gmae isn't fun. You will get to witness some seriously ridiculous conditions, such as rains or blizzards that which can pretty much blind you. There are also times where you can get your hands on some vehicles. Cherish them, as me and my friend managed to ram more than 100 enemies while driving an average looking hummer jeep (and it 'capsized' after my friend tried to ram a boss and failed).   I didn't play much to give a full account on how to stretch this game to its full potential, though I am certain this will be a great party game and its worth a laugh or two. Just one thing, don't get this game at full price.
981	1	a	There are Tower Defence games, and then there are games like Ork's Must Die. I very action packed game with a major focus on letting the player getting some insane kill counts and the like along with some brutal animations to follow. It ramps up the challanges as you progress, and offers allot of tools for you to pick, choose, and play around with to figure out what stratergys go best with your play style. This game also never once holds your hand, expecting you to figure things out on your own and run with it.   If there are any real flaws towards this game, it's base price at times feels a wee steep in my pocket for a 20 stage ( x2 if you count nightmare mode's alt mob waves ) single player experance with maxing out skulls, and climbing the leaderboards the only thing left once done with it. But admittily for $15, you are getting something that looks and plays like a full buget game as well, and that's pretty nice for a new devloper.  Regardless highly recommended.
3684	1	a	ONLY FOR 0,49 eur, seriously WTF??!?!?44! Nice game brooooos!
2691	1	a	This game, when it came out it 2012, was, without a doubt, a total wreck. Glitchy graphics, animations screw ups, pathfinding issues, etc.  Now?  One of the best survival shooters I have played. It's tieing with Gears of War's horde mode and Halo's Firefight mode for best survival shooter I have played.  Seriously, Play. The. Game. It. Is. Awesome. YEEHAW!!!!!
2289	1	a	This is a really good game, not 'good because it's cheap', but this game stands on it's own merits. Lots of fun, good feeling weaponry, the graphics are simple but clear and attractive. Strongly recommend.
798	1	a	Best TD game I've ever played.
5118	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
1359	1	a	It's just good clean... well not so clean, beat em' up murder and mahem. This reminds me of a classic sidescrolling beatemup game that you would find in an arcade, except it's on my compter, and it oozes blood from every orifice.
1000	1	a	Very Very Fun Game ! ! ! If you are a fan of defence games, action games, or just like dismembering hordes of orcs. This game is for you. Plenty of traps and spells to keep you busy and entertained for hours on end. I love it and can't keep away.  -SirFrontsalot  aka TurboPreston aka Reaper
1339	1	a	Awesome game go for it
5460	0	a	This game is completely reprehensible filth. Even the low price tag cannot justify this 'game'. I bought two copies, one for me and my friend. We played for a while and had many technical difficulties. Let it be noted that we do not have poor computers or low specs. He was experiencing lag for a lack of a compatability pack that wasn't installed with the core download. It gave no notice that it would cause issues and no method of installing it after.   The gameplay was abhorent. I've played Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, and it was significantly more complete than this. I literally could not find an aspect of gameplay that was complete or satisfying. The dinosaurs AI is dumber than a stump, and their animations are just repeatedly walking into you while your screen has a violent red seizure. The graphical fidelity is not present. These visuals aren't bad necessarrily, there just isn't any style or charm. They're similar to the Call Of Duty graphics. Bland. There was no impact from the gunfire and shooting guns seemed to be problematic. A core element of the game was not even functional. The vehicles are awful. It's similar to driving a ghost from Halo without any physics. The sounds were generic, similar to stock sounds you can find online or on YouTube. The music wasn't even something I acknowledged was present. It's bland. The game modes are just sitting there and fighting bland generic raptors. There is no exploration, there is nothing interesting. You stand there, shoot raptors and then die. The servers are dead empty for a reason.   DO NOT BUY  This is the WORST game I have ever paid for on Steam. Thank god for refunds.
2385	1	a	Was â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the start, developers were like 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ me with a mango flavored popsticle, looks like we gotta improve this â¥â¥â¥â¥.' and then they gave us an update more vicious than a hobo hurling out of his trolley in believe of hearing a 5c coin dropping to the ground and seeing you about to pick it up. This game could kill a 78 year old man just by... know what, it probably can't do that, BUT NOT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING YET ANYWAY, this game is still being worked upon to become such a popular steam game that it will have its own store where you can buy in-game items and trade them over the steam community with your beloved friends and other members of this ever growing community, now where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ have we heard of this before???? Till then it will be a 10/10 and HOPEFULLY remain that way after all those traveling salesmen come along and turn this game into a bartering simulator.
2235	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
3081	1	a	its a great strategy game that you can battle dinosaurs! and beware in the map hell where you randomly fight the pumpkin king. hell map is best for assault as you can use jetpack to get on a cliff and take some potshots at the pumpkin king! good luck dino hunters!!!!
1590	1	a	Fun game to play while watching a stream or just for fun.
345	1	a	I love this game, it's a beautiful tower defense game, when i bought it, i played it till the end. 6 hours of game in a row 
931	1	a	Play Orcs Must Die! It's a good game.
2595	1	a	Despite some negative feedback, this game realley deserves to be praised for its ingenuity and fun gameplay. Over all I really do recommend this game and I give it a solid 8/10.
4461	0	a	Awful graphics and awful game play. no wonder it's being flogged for 99p this weekend.
3397	1	a	There are lightsabers.... 11/10
4267	0	a	I never asked for a 90's shooter.
4955	1	a	- Disclaimer I am here for the gameplay, not the Legal issues, the amount of games that have had copy right strikes are deeply loved and no-one cared.  -Review Time. I actually enjoyed my time on this game, especially for a 1$ game, it is fun, character is customisable, aswell as being able to play as a dino.
1095	1	a	Awesome game for any and all pc gamers.
4950	1	a	Very fun game . PVP , PVE and shoot shoot and shoot :) Nice upgrades , nice weapons . I love it . And Nice Dino's :)
5793	1	a	I played a game with bots, I had fun, killing dinosaurs is surprisingly satisfying. The bots are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ though. And the textures look like they were made in Paint. Then again, I payed 70 cents for this, I don't know what I expected.
245	1	a	A very fun third-person tower defense/strategy game from a person point of view. Great humor, fun story, goofy voice acting and atmosphere, later levels can provide a solid challenge to the more skilled players.
591	1	a	That's just too much fun for 4 bucks.
3588	1	a	Really enjoy this game, they've hit on a great formula; especially the co-op conquest maps. It's one of those games with a very simple concept done flawlessly. Graphics are great too, I have a fairly old graphics card and this runs nice and smooth at full res.  Vehicles are great, the ballistic tank weapon is great. It's fun. I really like how when you go up levels you have a decent starting weapon too.
3474	1	a	If y0u like Killing Floor , then your g0nna love this game :)  Watch out for the T-rex   x
2393	1	a	I'm not too sure why this game has such a low meta score. I only played this for 17 minutes and that was during the free weekend, to make a let's play, and during that time, I had a lot of fun. Sure, the shooting isn't the best but the concept and the graphics are awesome!  I only played this on easy so I don't know if the dinosaurs would be harder on the harder levels or if you just have less ammo etc... but shooting dinosaurs is quite good fun!  This is one of them times where you shouldn't actually listen to metacritic and just go ahead and buy the game.  I have to admit though, this game is not worth Â£11.99, maybe just Â£5 but I would recomend it to anyone for just 99p!   This is a really good game overall and I liked it a lot!   You can see a full let's play of it here:  www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming  (the let's play will be going up later today)
4805	1	a	halo x jurassic park= best game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ever! make sure u got some friends to play with or skype and have a great time 
4881	1	a	this game is fun and very addicting.
1281	1	a	Judging by its cover, one wouldn't immediately assume Gatling Gears to be a bullet hell shooter. Features familiar to this genre include dodging insane amounts of enemies and projectiles mid-combat as the camera forcefully pans horizontally or vertically.   Gatling Gears mixes the formula up by letting the player drive a ground-based machine. This not only heightens the player's maneuverability, but it also allows him to control the pace of the camera - a nice addition that aids the less hardcore audience.  For combat, there are a total of four different weapons at the player's disposal, three of which are upgradeable by collecting gold scattered through the levels. Using them skillfully is pivotal to maintaining a high multiplier which will boost your ranks in the leaderboards and unlock aesthetics.  In terms of a bullet hell shooter, Gatling Gears is arguably the most beautiful. However, it is neither the most challenging nor the most memorable. It's also pretty repetitive.  Grade: C
2067	1	a	Okey is the word I'd use for this, okey graphics, controls and sound. But the price makes it worth picking up. 4/10
5924	0	a	A terrible shooter that not even dinosaurs could save.
3070	1	a	Absolute bute game.Ever since the major update buying a 4 pack for $2.99 was a complete steal
4372	0	a	WORST GAME IN THE WORLD IT SUCKS DONT WASTE A DOLLAR ITS A STUPID GAME
4403	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are terrible and the best computer can't handle it weith the worst graphics on possible. And the game is just laggy and glitchy. This is the worst game to ever be in existense. The dinasours just like to fly around and attack you while you can't see because of the laggy peice of shot game â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tits.
907	1	a	A fun game with orcs that must die
5766	1	a	Fun game with lots of vehicles like mechs tanks hovercrafts and helicopters ,also lots of different weapons addjustable difficulty levels, a solid server system and summarized a little fun game defenetly worth 74cent.
1274	1	a	Great graphics, great gameplay, balance, controls and amazing soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best schmups ever made. They really need to make Gattling Gears 2 soon!   5 Stars!
2049	1	a	BUY THIS ON A SALE FARM FOR CARDS TO SELL *POOF* EXTRA MONEY FOR YOU
5992	1	a	its a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that steals counter strike's guns, and halo's vehicles. but I had fun with it.
348	1	a	The best 'tower defense' game I ever played.
1081	1	a	Slaughter at it's best!
4493	1	a	super great game u have to get this game
3663	1	a	This Dino killing game is very fun to play, it is super cheap and the gameplay is satasfying.
5313	0	a	Ridiculously bad. I mean, I downloaded this thinking that it might at least be funny, but it's really very terrible. Not even in a so-bad-it's-good way, if you've ever played any other FPS at all, it'll take you one wave in survival to decide that this was a terrible decision.
1736	1	a	I bought this super cheap because it had Steam cards and it turned out to be a super fun indie platformer with occasional rocket interplanetary experience.  Totally worth it!
4307	1	a	This is the most underrated game on steam.
1094	1	a	Funny, nice visuals and satisfying combat and trap setting.
1026	1	a	A interactive Tower Defense Game that doesn't have you standing around watching the enemies die to your traps. Countless traps are available, use your sword and bow for direct and ranged combat or use powerful trinkets that give you the ability to control certain elements. Examine your surroundings and build the best death trap possible to hold back the Orcish Horde.  Highly addictive and endless amounts of fun. Well worth the $15.
5825	1	a	I like the game, though don't expect a whole lot of depth. It's fun for $1, so I would recommend it for that price.
4810	1	a	Really cool game its like playing Halo with dinosaurs on it
5569	0	a	This game is basically ebola with aids just mixed in there.
1498	1	a	Fun little title. IMO it's somewhat underrated.
4893	0	a	not a very good shooter. Good if you have no money and a subpar computer .
2793	1	a	Great fun with friends :D
3754	0	a	A horrible, unfinished piece of buggy trash. Not worth $0.99. Broken animations, terrrible and boring gameplay, typical class system with a unfinshed upgrade store, just avoid. Run, run while you can.  -1000/10
5737	0	a	It's on sale for .49 cents. That should tell you all you need to know without someone explaining it to you.
6144	1	a	Wait? I thought I bought 'ORION: Dino Horde' - maybe I was dreaming ...
3996	1	a	I have wasted $0.68, now that the devs made this game free-to-play. For me, this game is good, i just play with bots, because i live in Asia, and there are like 5 servers on this game. 400 if not 500 ping on every server, do you expect me to play with that ping?  But overall, good game. DEVS made this game free for those who want to try.
4927	1	a	I love this game! Its one of few games that I own that I not only like, but I am pretty good at as well. You really can not beat the price of only $0.99 which I am not sure if that is what I got it for or not because I do not remember when I bought it, but its worth more then a dollar! Most times when I play I host the game, and most times I stream it via  Stream.AWFordJr.net  which I use D3DGear to stream to Youtube. If you like FPS type games, then you may like this one. Its well worth the low price its going for. So get it!
912	1	a	It's tower defense, but without all the boring.
2968	1	a	Call of Duty: Dinosaurs  11/10
4804	1	a	Why is this so godamn addicting
2297	1	a	Totally Worth 99 cents
1331	1	a	If you see this dude, just stay away from him or he will shred you to pieces.
1755	1	a	Nice game, Kinda high price for just a flash game tho, And fps issues. But still its cute and stupid af
5295	0	a	this game is not worth it
3788	1	a	IS SO GOOD MYROM PLAY IT
4605	0	a	Literally only 10 people are allways online
1709	1	a	Great game for 20 cents. Lol.
4698	1	a	Don't go out and buy that packet of Doritos!   Spend it on this, it's amazing! Be sure you have friends you can play with though. Then you can 1v1, survive hordes of dinosaurs, or 5v5 pvp and even lightsaber duels!
688	1	a	My god this game is perfect, needs a co-op though, luckilt the second one has it. But holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is the funnest 3 hours ive spent procrastinating an essay in ages   GET IT.
2723	1	a	I found Barney the dinosaur, I gave him 10 hugs. and by Barney I mean T-rex and by hugs I mean rockets to the head
4399	1	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this â¥â¥â¥â¥
5130	1	a	Awesome Co-Op game to be played, the [0.99 USD] is totally worth the price. Its 1 Dollar US but 2 Dollars in AUS. Same price as a Candy Bar.
1917	0	a	01010100 01101000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100111 01100001 01101101 01100101 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01110011 01101000 01101001 01110100
239	1	a	What it says on a tin.  Fun!  Fun-fun-fun. Polished game, smooth action. Game feels fluid and responsive Enjoyable. Challenging enough, nice pacing, has character progression.
1586	1	a	ðððð
5523	1	a	the game is cheap has awsome mechanics and is great to play with friends
542	1	a	Pretty fun tower defence with comical story.
3938	1	a	Funny game with ragdolls thats messy, but don't buy if you are looking for a correct gameplay its soo fa-doodled also graphics
4589	1	a	Why'd you make it Free2Play? It's a total waste of my money!
2018	1	a	It has a few graphical errors every once in a while regarding background textures, but it's otherwise an enjoyable game
3473	1	a	in this game u can shoot with guns so if u like shooting game u like this game but also not every one like shoot animals(dinosaur) so if u hate animal shoot u dont like this game :)
461	1	a	It's a kind of game that you want to play it more and more! I also liked it because there is ranking system so I always try to win my friends. The best tower defense I've ever played...
5322	0	a	This is not worth the 50 cents i paid for it.
4527	1	a	Its a game about killing dinos with swords,lasers,bows,rockets,etc. and theres hats and its 1 dollar  It be stupid not to get this game No seriously buy it! You think i left? im still here. Waiting for you to buy it...... I can do this all day........
1361	1	a	Mutch harder than the first but its good. 12/10 would rage on hard mode again.
465	1	a	Are you a racist scumbag who believes orcs must die? If so, then buy Orcs Must Die!
3942	1	a	It's very cheap and very entertaining to play when you're bored. The graphics are really nice and runs very well on my computer.
888	1	a	There are these orcs. They must die. ALL OF THEM.  This game owns. (also I wrote this recommendation so I'd get a steam gift thingie achievement)
1641	1	a	Pretty good little game. Not very easy, not very hard, levels smartly created. Reminds me of those free games you can find online and have some hours of fun. This one is more completed and the overall experience worths its price. If you want it to get more difficult, do not content oneself with the original levels.
6124	1	a	This is a great game, dinos, weapons, pve and pvp, loadouts, levels, unlockables, classes. If you like these things, get it! For only 99 cents right now, it can't hurt, right?
3142	1	a	I don't know why, but i can write a review for this game. I have 74 minutes of playtime, and have unlocked 14 acheivements. I have never played this game.  ?  
3924	1	a	It's that one type of Halo game but with Dinosaurs!!
5950	1	a	By far one of the best co-op shooting games ive played if not THE best. its just so riculously fun and the gameplay is fantastic. Also achievements. all kinds of achivements. u play as futuristic soldiers with jetpacks and guns slaying waves of dinosaurs. i shuldnt need to say anything more, 9/10
1559	1	a	Just Relax And Play This game if good if you have free time and wanna rest   Just Stop when you lost tray again if you want
5514	0	a	Dont support thieves. Unfortunately I did and I truelly regret it now...
4358	0	a	not even worth the dollar i paid for it
4263	1	a	I paid Â£0.79, to ram a Triceratops with a car, he flung me across the map and i landed on about 5 velociraptors. 10/10
2898	1	a	its good 
6181	0	a	For me it crashed when tried to start a match Lowered graphics still crashed, I have a Geforx 9800 + Games like the Witcher 2 &amp; Batman Arkham Asylum work for me - Witcher 2 on low Batman on max  So maybe it just dosen't work on older cards even if they are capable
434	1	a	This game is REALLY fun.
5489	0	a	I cannot think of a more horrifying experience. I'd rather have militant terrorists penetrate my eye sockets than play this again. My neighbors all moved out of my neighborhood and the value of my house is degrading because of how severely awful this game is. An â¥â¥â¥â¥ is more exciting than this game. This game is probably used in small African societies to scare small children into walking 40 miles to get a bucket of well water. It is easier to untangle 10 miles of braided steel cable than it is to enjoy this game. I would easily never recommend this to anyone. I do not understand why this game ever was accepted through steam green light, but it seems to me that whoever accepted it has a major mental deficiency. This game is so terrible that I don't even know if it is legal to make something on this level of scum. If I wrote anymore on this review, then I would be giving the game unnecessary attention that it clearly does not deserve.
3713	0	a	This game is very laggy and it isn't very nice if you dont know how to play the game. The dinosaurs are to hard to kill and it is very hard to aim the gun! DON'T BUY THIS GAME
806	1	a	Another great spin on tower defense. You can create elaborate traps - lots of very fun trap types that work well together, each one upgradeable for a small meta game (each trap type can be upgraded once). You can also take on orcs by making yourself more powerful (upgrading spells, damage, etc). And of course, you can do both. The main campaign has 24 levels, which take anywhere from 5-15 minutes each. Took me about 8-10 hrs to complete the campaign. Then if you enjoyed it, there's leaderboards and some DLC that give you reasons to play more.
4019	1	a	Better cost to replay value than BF4
2442	1	a	OREOS: Dino Horse is the spiritual successor to the universally acclaimed smash hit Cabela's Outdoor Adventures, building upon everything that made the fan favorite so spectacular (YOU JUST USE CARS TO WIN, AS LONG AS YOU ARE SEATED IN A VEHICLE THE ONLY HORIZON FOR YOU IS ONE OF GOLDEN RADIANCE) and revving it up to the next level! Squeezed from fresh virgins harvested at Spiral Games Studios very own Hell Engine, ARYANS: Dino Harp finally delivers what all satanists have been craving for the past 2 decades: For someone to take good ol' fashioned class based FPS gameplay, dumb it straight the â¥â¥â¥â¥ down, shoehorn in pointless costumes and hats, and throw in all the assets from Natural Selection but instead of aliens have ZANY â¥â¥â¥ SPACE DINOSAURS so that it can all be blended up, mixed into a fine non-alcoholic beverage, and poured all over the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ground because holy hell this game is complete dogshit why in God's name would anyone wanna drink it. But don't soften up yet, cause this game's still got enough hilariously stupid shenenigans to keep your â¥â¥â¥â¥ rock solid; It's got all the core essentials to being cool, including but not limited to 1) Dramatic Slo-Mo Kill Cams so you can soak in you/your friends every death, 2) Motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥in jetbikes, 3) Motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥in JETPACKS, 4) Poorly Optimized Motion Blur (a strong sign of being truly next-gen), and 5) Rag Doll Physics out the â¥â¥â¥. If you aren't soaked through to the seat by now than you gotta have a crotch colder than the Artic Circle, in which case this is the kind of game that might just actually kill you. TL;DR it's ugly and stupid and cheap but if you're looking for a silly co-op shootbanger than you came to the right place
2714	0	a	it dose't woke on my windows 7   WTF I wrote this review when i was seven. My friend got me this game to play it but it is not working. I am gonna try to fix it bye reinstaling it but I cant stop laughing about the â¥â¥â¥â¥ review I left/
4956	1	a	when people ask me if i like to play orion: prelude i look at them and say 'I CAN'T STOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP' DOO DOO DA DOO DOO
5455	1	a	'HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IN FICTIONAL CREATURES LIKE 'DINOSAURS', BUT NOT GOD? BECAUSE YOU ARE FOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY SATAN, WHO IS IN THE WORLD, WHICH MEANS SCIENCE, TOO. GOD DID NOT CREATE 'DINOSAURS', SINCE THEY ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE. PLEASE START A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, OR YOU WILL BE CAST INTO ETERNAL HELL! MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU! :)ï»¿' - KALIA CIRELLE JOHNSON   iz gud gam
6331	1	a	Not what I thought it would be.....But â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was only 99 cents.
6403	0	a	Waste of bandwidth.
131	1	a	If you've ever had the sadistic urge to kill en masse with a plethora of cruel, innovative, and brutal methods this is the game for you
4743	1	a	10/10 Orion Prelubbed
1847	1	a	I love this game... I love...I LOVE IT!
5163	0	a	Running from giant dinosaur. Dinosaur gets stuck on a small rock step. Free kill easy wins gg no re topkeklol. 10/10 would not recommend.
6384	1	a	This game is obviously a labor of love. Good game
86	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
1061	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2456	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥ was .99 cents.
2139	1	a	Right now i have played around 20 hours on it and I'm still enjoying it! If you just want to relieve some stress, just play this game. It certainly helps. The fairness between Man and Dino is in favor of Man. It depends if YOU like that, but i certainly do. Note: With friends it's MUCH more fun.  PROS: - A lot of variety in weapons and vehicles. - A lot of different game modes. It never gets boring. - Very well-made maps. - Different classes. (assault, support and recon) - Augments where you can buy all sorts of stuff. - It is strategic. e.g. which augments and weapons should you buy first? CONS: - There are some strange bugs. But they can always be solved. - When playing Solo. It kinda gets boring after a while.  Over all, I REALLY enjoy this game and now my other friends can join too bc it's F2P now! P.S. I see a lot of people complaining it's F2P now and they want their money back. Jesus Christ it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 99 cents and you even get helmets for it. Stop complaining for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake.
3386	1	a	I've seen the steam key giveaway in the begining of the month... so I tried... Everytime I could not get one. Well the heck with that, I decided to buy the game some days ago (1 dollar is cheap) well... WELL... WELL.... MOST AWESOME GAME OF THE TIME. I mean FOR REAL! No micro transaction, no paying dlc, fun games, dinosaurs and kinda old school: all I searched for! A plus is the community ;) thanks for making this happen! I have faith in the future of video games again because people like you put passion and pleasure into your games and the players can enjoy it fully! :) Well be right back I have to eat some humans now
3957	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. The physics engine is flawless. I was wrecking dinos left and right and then a T-Rex through a boulder at me. 10/10 would buy the 4 packs for friends.
1422	1	a	It's the kind of game you want to play with friends in your spare time.
3752	0	a	About as fun as masturbating with sandpaper.
2360	1	a	I just picked a 4pack up for 3$.   Pros vs Cons:  Pros: Dinosaurs Jetpacks Mechs Tanks Dinosaurs  Cons: I can't find a laser..but there is a F'CKING LASERSWORD..  Really, for 1$, there are no cons. It works, I had fun. And I KILLED DINOSAURS USING A JETPACK.  Buy it.
6103	1	a	good game if you are interested in just having a bit of fun with friends
2320	1	a	A lot better than it looks. It's like Shadow of the Colossus, mixed with iCarly.
3518	0	a	You are wasting money if you are going to buy this game for 0,99 cents,believe me it's not worth that money. The game is buggy and they are too many glitches,bad gameplay. Anyway it's â¥â¥â¥â¥!
5775	0	a	this game suckss i want my money backk
2143	1	a	I have not played this game for all it has to offer but I feel like I have already gotten my dollars worth so I do recommend this game, for a dollar it is amazing!  I was looking for a dinosaur game to play with my young son and found Orion: Prelude on sale for a dollar so with great reviews I thought why not?   Only playing one of the several game modes that this game offers (survival) here is my experience. Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress. You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves. One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it. I thought that was pretty cool.  The game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues. The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.  My last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up. I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.
1859	0	a	Controls are very not tight in moments where they need to be which is kind of game breaking, otherwise very very casual gameplay. Camera placement is pretty bad.
5315	0	a	It looks good but when you play it it's really not, graphics on guns and dinos are nice but everything else looks terrible. Honestly this game is not worth the $.99 it costs
2449	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
2336	1	a	For a dollar, this was one of the craziest and most enjoyable games I've purchased. The fast-paced hordes of velociraptors, pterodactyls, and eventual T-rex is absolutely amazing with 4 of your friends, if not complete strangers. Not to mention the insane abailities and vehicles, like jetpacks and health stealing, or tanks and mech suits.   Buy this game for a buck, and kill dinos without giving a ****.
658	1	a	Its been years since ive played a game as entertaining as this!! the large amount of traps(allowing many combinations) and the large variation of fortresses(where in each you can find a certain advantage) allows one to play them over and over,another bonus is that every trap you unlock and every upgrade you buy is persistant so you can go to an earlier level to experiment with the new traps. the 'Nightmare' difficulty also picks up nicely where the war-mage dificulty ends. this game is all about making facing hordes of orcs fun and they have done a excellent job with that!!  the Quotes that the orcs spill are also funny. the Normal difficultty campaign took me about 8 hours to complete.
1130	1	a	This is a fun game but it's definitely quirky.  + Interesting level design + Configurable upgrades with Weavers  - Some levels way too open with too few options to build defenses - You can't refund skulls; so you anticipation/guessing plays into unlocking items - You can't redefine keys (defaults to WASD) which is ... short-sighted - No option to create your own maps 
897	1	a	Fun! Fast paced Mayhem! With a great sense of humor!
6374	1	a	7/10  This is not a AAA title, it's not a multimillion dollar project, it looks like a final project for a college game design class (not exactly a bad thing). What it is, despite the low budget and little issues, is fun. Super fun. Think Halo meets Turok with a dash of Tribes and a hint StarHawk. The game is fairly easy and straight forward so you don't often end up in matches with players that single handedly lose the match. It's cheap, it's fun, it's easy to learn. Give it a try. Just don't expect something mind shattering. I forgot to mention the superb weather and day/night effects. When you get into it, night time rain is really spooky. The frost effects on the arctic map are amazing too. The longer you're outside or using the jetpack, the more frosted your visor gets and the game gets nuts.
2122	1	a	is it a perfect game? Nope not at all BUT it is very fun i bought it back when it was $0.99 and even though its now f2p i still dont regret it, its a fun fps game to just shoot some dinosaurs trying to stop your generators and you have a large assortment of vehicles aswell as weapons also if you play most of your games offline and solo like i do it completely supports that so grab some guns and blast some space dinos!  (if there is one bad thing to be said its the micro-transaction store for cosmetics im not a fan of stuff like that in any game at all but aside from that its still a solid fun game to play)
654	1	a	Totally nuts. If you like tower defense and/or action games, this game is for you. Not much story in it, but hey! Who needs a story, if you can build all kinds of traps and participate in the action?
5560	0	a	I purchased this and was gifted ORION project and at first thought Activisions DMCA takedown was unfair, since then I understand that the asset theft is fairly clear and this is the shadiest â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game developer I've seen, the game has been renamed multiple times to avoid negative reviews on steam (Previously ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde) as well as a complete rename of the developer and publisher in an attempt to avoid other DMCA takedowns, do not buy any ORION game, it really isn't worth supporting
2048	1	a	Casual fun that is still challenging
5917	1	a	Cmon man what are you even looking at the reviews ? You can shoot waves of dino's !!! This game is simply a good game and it's .99 just buy this XD
4347	1	a	I think this is a fun small game. Sure theres not much to do but its still can be fun.
5317	0	a	It's still â¥â¥â¥â¥
872	1	a	Amusing, mindless fun. Slaughtering orcs makes for good gameplay and a great way to unwind after work. The third-person perspective offers a different approach to tower defense games.
141	1	a	This is a great game. I was hesitant at first, but a third person tower defense game kept me entertained for hours. I managed to get the second one as well. It's a fairly difficult game, depending on your skill level.  
5273	0	a	stephan hawking runs better than this game.
3412	1	a	this game is really fun, worth playing. totally worth it 
3724	0	a	Grab the smallest vehicle, the biggest sniper and rock the dinos hard. However, it is pretty much the same every single game. Defend this, capture that, return and defend. Over and over and over again. It gets pretty fast pretty boring. I played it for like 4? hours?! And i guess I have seen everything. I took the advantage of the free-days-to-play, but I dont bother buying it even for 99 Cent ...
4204	0	a	The game has horrible optimization and it crashes all the time.
5772	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Pterodactyls. 11/10
6433	1	a	A couple gumballs that will last a couple minutes or a game that will last you a couple hours, your choice.
5066	1	a	AWESOME GAME!! It is one of the best games i have ever played, and for you who is thinking about getting it do so.
4458	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
365	1	a	 This game is like Tower Defense except you get to be a part of it! A third person shooter game where you set up defenses to prevent trolls and other troll variety from getting too many to the exit. While you also shoot and stop them ontop of it! While trying not to get killed by them. Sad part is it's only Single Player, that's why I only play the second game with my friend.  9/10
1653	1	a	Surprisingly deep. Literally.
4000	1	a	this is such a awsome game but i wish the performance for it would be better on my laptop :x -highly reconmmend dont worry about the meta score its false the developers are doing a awsome job adding new stuff to the game so far ; 0
5833	1	a	It alright for a dollar i guess.
885	1	a	excellent tower defence game.
6225	1	a	The game is awesome! 
3216	1	a	The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
1579	1	a	If you have previosly tried this game, but at some point had problems making it start I recomend you read the last paragraph.  FIrst of all you should know my review may be kinda biased by something the dev did (altough I will try to my fullest being neutral). But I hope you have the time and will to still read it. When I bought the game it was kinda mediocre. It got few towers indeed.  Basically there is on fast hitting mg, A slower but stronger canon, Slowing flamethrower, A basic AA and depending on which faction you have money generating thingie and a mega big a** canon (I believe its main its canongun would be a very nice ploace to camp in). The thing this game has going for it placement, and the order in which you place your turrets and upgrade them. As a result of this it becomes repeat until you have learnt what to do process, but finnaly understanding it is imensily satsifying. I will not lie i used walktoughs to get through some of the levels (there I said it now someoen give me x amount of money as is regarded the right thing to do as punishment, to all politicians or politican like figures who deos something unethical uptil blowing up this planet wiht a press on the wrong BIG red button).  True enough the game can be viewed as shallow and its enemies can also be seen as spongebobby (taking so much damage that your weapons/tools lose their awesomeness) but its something imensily satisfying when you manage to complete a map on hard. Or when something about the last enemy in that wave clikcs and you finnaly understand how to repay the poor german tank commander with a family who only fight because he needs medicine for his mother or something for last time he made you lose a base life tenfold (I made four canons shot at him at the same time therefore ensuring that he probably now is going arounf orbit (there you see how the myth about moon nazis was created)).  Bottomlien is that even if it has repeat untill you learn and winn mechanic it doesnt take very long for you to understand it if you pay attention. Now the thing is if you maanage to pay attention. The graphics are a little below mediocre making it in my eyes difficuklt seing the details about for example enemy units and the like. They certainly wont make you goo with big shiny anime eyes either (quick everyone put on your big eyed anime bubblehead mask). One thing should be said about the grapihcs tough. Looking at the games from this coman in this series its easy to see a pattern so they should atleast have a clap for staying put regaridng theses games identity (the ibomber games, 4 in total as I know about). And I certainly dont think they are unpleasant to look like I jsut think they had benefitted form more details.  I at the start mentioned soemthing about the dev doing soemthing right? Well it goes like this. I bought this game over two years ago. Immediatly after purchase I became hooked. For a few weeks I played it a good deal, but then suddenly it stopped working. I tried contacting the devs got no response and gave up. recently I tried again for reasons I cant remeber (probaly impulse) and to my suprise they acctually responded after a few weeks. After giving them my specs tehy told me to wait and try it again after the end of the week. Which I did after donwloading it. To my suprsise it worked. So there you have it a happy ending. No brush your teeth little one and sleep tight. -blows out candle-
1639	1	a	To be honest this game has not THAT much conetent but thats not what i would expect for a low-price indie game. The graphics are nicely done in cartoon/comic style  Gameplay with controller works amazingly good (used Xbox Controler)  The level design is very various and shows new challenges in nearly every stage of its 40.   The survival mode*s last level is pretty difficult to master and needs a bit of multitasking but i liked it a lot.     Conclusion:  awesome Game , anyone wanna have fun for about 4-6 hours definitly buy! lovely little game!     Rating   :  8/10   (Indie-Game) 
179	1	a	Ok so this game represents everything wrong with society in my opinion, What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ is so bad about Orcs that we just need to keep killing them and killing them and killing them. Like I bet if we just treated them fairly they would be just really chilled out and help us out and â¥â¥â¥â¥ but noooo just because they are stronger than us (Insecurity much?) and have different colour skin (Racism much?) we have to spike them and shoot them and smash them up. Y'know what? â¥â¥â¥â¥ this. I wanna be an Orc.  10/10 would think I'm playing Sanctum again.
4179	1	a	OMG what awesome fun this is just get it
1932	0	a	  A friend gifted this to me for no reason. Well, it's pretty boring. Just get its trading cards and then unistall it. ~3/10
4841	0	a	Not only has this game changed its name 3 TIMES. But its hasnt changed anything in the game itself, infact with the new 'and improved'''''' Prelude update, NOTHING is different from what have i found. I paid 15 dollors for this. Now its less then one..... Lie honestly. i dont have many hours in this game because it honestly sucks, like seriously. It looks like it was made on the unity engine, The gameplay is terrible, and the new 'horde Bots' that theyve added are reeally just random characters FULLY decked out with all the pay to win gear, plus, they dont even get attacked barely, It would be as if the dinos dont see them and come straight torwards the player. The screenshots are nothing like the game itself, it shows itself as a fun and enjoyable game to play with friends. WHen in reality it goes as follows ' Hey dude you get Orion?' ' No it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥' ' so what play it with me, il even buy it for you' I buy it for a bud, we play and after 20 minutes we give up, because its just that bad of a game. Multiplayers a drag, the guns are basic. The guns look all futuristic and that they shoot lazers..... No.... Its just bullets. No lazers or any of the sorts. The stuff that you buy in game affect the game in absolutely no way possible, There just ' Hey look at me i look cool i spent 5 bucks in game, Wait no one plays this game.' ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE IN PURCHASE ITEMS, AND THE LOWEST PRICED ITEM IS MORE THEN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF. IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING. RIDICULOUS. Dont buy the damn game, after this review I uninstalling as i just spent 10 minutes in the game. NOTHING IS CHANGED. just the name, for the third time. The meta score is right, it sucks. Even the loading images are the exact same. the class pictures are the exact same. the dinos are the exact same. the maps are the same. The AI is still the same. It is still the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ ass game it was a few months back when i regret paying like 15 or whatever bucks for a game. Stay away from this. Seriously, unless your absolutely bored and u have less then 2 GB of storage to mess with, along with a mouse that if you can click 16 shots in less then 1 milli then your absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ed in online PVP matches, run by the little kids who think there cool Because they host a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ listen server off there parents internet. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥, im out
611	1	a	Killing orcs is so much fahn.
195	1	a	One of my favorite games. Loads of fun in a strategy/puzzle FPS.
351	1	a	Well polished, funny and addictive. One of the better releases of 2011 that takes the tedium out of the Tower Defense genre.
2163	1	a	Do not listen to the metascore!!! This game is awesome and I've had so much fun playing this game so far, if you are thinking about getting this game for the $.99 get it! You won't regret it.
811	1	a	If you have played Dungeon Defenders, this feels just like it expect it's single player. It is a great game, all the traps and weapons feel really nice and the game will always give you a challenge.
6335	1	a	Probably the bets game to play with your friends if your into FPS. Its crazy fun on a friday night with some pumping music!  Its so bad, its good!
1804	1	a	Beep Beep and i got some cards XD
2204	1	a	The game I feel that it is underrated and it's developers have been keeping to their promises and are still developing it with community ideas with support from people.
1012	1	a	Tower defensive game with a sense of humour, good fun!
1891	1	a	This game is awesome and fun! I reccomend it!
2630	1	a	To be honest, this game is bad aesthetically. Its animations are rudimentary at best and the gun animations are out of sync but what do you expect from a game that costs 0.99 freakin' cents?! The gameplay is repetitive but somehow it keeps me playing for a few hours (I just go straight for the mech during the later waves) but again 0.99 freakin' cents! I recommend this game solely because of the price. The game is fun with some friends and you owe it to yourself to try it out. It isn't the best looking game but it is a hell of alot of fun once you get the hang of it.  PS: There is microtransactions in the game but only for cosmetic items so if you are one of those people who love buying virtual items using real life money... go ahead nobody is stopping you (or you could buy the items to support the developers ;-) ).
4879	1	a	Good game. Offers lot and lots of fun, even more with friends. Fun concept and easy to learn. High variety of guns, you can play with ( obviously not with dinosaurs ). I found it more enjoyable in co-op mode, not playing as dinosaurs that much. Again you have to decide on your own playstyle. Recommended!
3863	0	a	If I knew what I know now about this game I never would have bought it I'd say the current price of 99 cents is a ripoff. Unless they changed every single broken â¥â¥â¥â¥ing aspect of this piece of turd since I played it then its still the worst game I've ever played. And I've played some â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my day.
4834	1	a	I AM CRAZY TO THE GAME
4818	1	a	This game is amazing. I'm woundering how could the metascore for this game is low. Coming from someone who loves playing co-op games, this is really fun. Gets really hectic and hard and it's just the way I like it.  Gameplay is Good Graphics is Pretty Awesome Scenery is Amazing if you take the time to look around  There are some bugs here and there that I found but nothing really significant that will alter the game.  Overall I really enjoy this game and is a blast to play with friends :)
5911	1	a	You won't get a better game for this price. Its not a bad FPS, Now with the workshop it'll have an entire community of people working to create maps, textures, weapons, missions. for Â£2 or $3 for a four pack, you really should buy this and get your buddies in on the insanity. You won't regret it for this price. Its almost criminal not to buy it.
4309	0	a	Dont waste your money on this game its really slow for average computers as well as a bad game keep looking for a better dinosaur shooter like primal hunter!
4772	0	a	I don't write reviews. But when I do, it's cuz the game sucked.
3575	0	a	Graphics are crap, but whatever it costs a buck, the community is terrible, but that's to be expected, and it kinda just plops you into a game with no tutorial, at least no tutorial that I could find, and if you have to search for the tutorial you're not doing your game right.
722	1	a	Best tower defense game I ever played. Setting traps is fun, especially once you unlock flingers and pushers, and having to mix it up yourself keeps it from getting slow or tedious. Plus if you like peons or Warhammer orcs, you'll love these too.
3652	1	a	The only game where you can slap giant crocodiles to death. 100/10
202	1	a	The most fun you can have without signing a waiver.
2718	1	a	This is a fun wave survival game. Its diffrent how it mixes future technology and dinosaurs together. It all works out to make a fun game. You start out at the begining of the round buying some guns or armor. Then you fight a wave of small Dinos and 2-3 bigger dinosaurs. For the 99 cents i paid, it was totally worth it. As cheap as it is i would say give it a shot.
4597	1	a	This is some good â¥â¥â¥â¥ right here
5449	1	a	Definitley the best game on the marketplace for a buck. Halo/Borderlands/Carnivores packed into one. It runs on my â¥â¥â¥â¥ty laptop, and it's simple but addicting. SO MANY CHIEVES. and it's got fuxxin dinosaurs my negros. BUY THIS, NOW. &lt;3 Gaabbe
856	1	a	Cool because its a First person tower defense
22	1	a	Good: - Core concept - Like puzzle quest, but the gameplay is simple, not overcomplicated (there is no sword and other magic artifacts) - Fun gameplay  Bad: - Not to deep game mechanics - Not to long campaign
983	1	a	Fun, quirky tower defense game that is simple to pick up, and allows you to defend your castle the way you want to. With all of the DLC(new weapons/traps), you are given a wide array of weapons and traps to set up to help you kill invading orcs. Just take a look around your map, learn the path the orcs are going to be taking to get to your Rift(the 'main base' you're trying to protect, if you will), pick your arsenal for the map, and let it begin! Each Rift will allow only a certain number of orcs to be let through, but let any more than the maximum run through it and it's game over. Campaign lasts a good 7-11 hours depending on how fast you play and how good you become at the game, and then the rest is just playing the game because it is a fun way to pass the time. Recommended for those who enjoy strategical games.
3619	1	a	I've had this game since 2012.   It sucked back then.  Now, it is flarking awesome.  This game only costs $1. That's one less breakfast buritto, and 20hrs. more of entertainment. This game is so much fun with friends, you get to llaugh and cry together as you puch and shoot hordes of raptors and T-rexes.
1377	1	a	Avoid this one, it's inferior to the first game in every way. Weapon loadout is more restricted, the difficulty ramp up is enourmous (even on Normal), and it doesn't have a co-op mode (IMO the most fun way to play the first one). Even the story is much worse: the first one is pure Robert RodrÃ­guez/Tarantino, while this one has zombies, cannibals and other supernatural elements. A real letdown, because the first Shank is a great game.
2732	1	a	After countless failed attempts, finally joined game. Lagged horrifically. Did nothing. Got achievement for being useless.  10/10 would be useless again.
4268	1	a	.
82	1	a	This game has a simple card playing mechanic where you play poker against an enemy to win. Powerups and collectible cards also help with gameplay and has an RPG style story that's interesting. A casual game that's easy to pick up and get addicted to. Great little game overall.  
1702	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this game.  Just finished it, saw that the story is to be continued, but haven't found any updates on it :(  Overall it's a great game for a cheap price.  10/10
624	1	a	Very cool and good planned TD action/game
1636	1	a	I bought Storm In A Teacup by mistake...good game tho. No ragrets
2586	1	a	10/10 
6251	1	a	Want to upgrade your steam account but you dont want to buy any expansive game? This a cheap steam upgrade pass you need!!  Good and fun to play. Its like CoD zombies but without the zombies or the CoD. A very good survival game for its price.
3775	0	a	The metascore is NOT misleading, the trailer is. Do not get this game, even if it is on sale for .99 cents. DO NOT listen to the quotes in the trailer, those were probably from the devs of the game. Seriously though, this game really sucked hard and there were so many bugs and issues with optimization. Not to mention the animations of the dinos, which were some of the worst animations i've ever seen. Don't get this game.
4455	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
2276	1	a	I have to say, this game has turned out to be pretty awesome. Keep up the good work devs, and thanks for making a fun game.
5673	0	a	I used to like this game, but with so much things going on with the company and CEO pretending to be victims of Activision's actions, while Activision have the truth, now I can not feel anything about this game but hate, this is disgusting. The game was fun, but now I can't just give my time to this disgusting Company.  Do not buy it, don't give your money to this **messed** up company.
462	1	a	I originally only got this for the Steam winter holiday achievement, but this game is one of the most original and clever I've seen in a while. It's pretty simple, but sometimes, that's just fine.
2682	1	a	You pay 1â¬ to play Halo and Killing floor at the same time!
4901	0	a	This is Bad
2105	1	a	I knifed a pterodactyl while jetpacking over my friend who was fighting a T Rex with a bow and shotgun
1415	1	a	Super fun brawler. Lots of really gratifying combos and button mashing. Combat is simple, but complex enough to keep it interesting throughout. Campaign is only about 3.5 hrs. Also has a co-op survival mode that seems cool if you like that sort of thing. The art style and violence are both over the top and a lot of fun!
165	1	a	This game helped me discover something important about myself. The fact that I apparently can never get tired of watching orcs die on traps.
2334	1	a	I thought dinosaurs were the scariest thing about this game. Turns out it's the bugs.
5947	1	a	not recomender for low spec pc but for pc that can survive this sure realy recomended =D 
5946	1	a	  This game is not important for the gaming world ^^    The graphic is ok...   The fun that you have in the game is 65% :D   
2012	1	a	At 21 moose cents, you are making more moeny off of the trading cards. might as well buy it.
4144	0	a	A great concept with poor fit and finish, Dino Horde/Prelude has come a long way but has farther to go before securing a lasting place on my hard drive. Score 6.0
2913	1	a	This game is total â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4172	0	a	Awful game, waste of 99p
5536	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS.  Or play the free week.  Then you'll know not to play it.
5756	1	a	This game consists of killing hoards and hoard of dinosaurs, its great, it has a solo or an online mode
6101	1	a	Game is awesome. Highly recommend it especially since the price is so cheap.
5551	0	a	I received 5 tumors from just buying this game.           ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) Can't have a review involving cancer without ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°). heheehehehehehe
5360	1	a	good game, ive not played it a lot, but it cost 9.99 â¬ i think. i bought it for 0.99 â¬ and the default price is now 0.79 â¬? what the quack? but anyway its a good game with dinosaurs .  8/10
6416	1	a	Surprisingly alot of fun for a dollar.
1047	1	a	This game is fun and yet suprisingly stratigic compared to what it looks like upon first glance. While I am only partialy through the game, I have to say that this is a must get if it is on sale.
5384	1	a	  its awesome fun and so fun you dont even wanna stop. keep up the good work
2309	1	a	DO YOU HATE PREHISTORIC LIFE? DO YOU HATE THEM ENOUGH TO MURDER THEM WITH VARIOUS FUTURISTIC WEAPONS?? IF YOU'VE ANSWERED NO TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, DO A 360 AND RE-EVALUATE YOUR LIFE CHOICES IN LIFE. BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS (AND THE OCCASIONAL QUADRAPED) TO TRULY FEEL SWEET JUSTICE AGAINST THAT VEGETARIAN STEGASAURUS THAT KILLED YOUR FAMILY BACK IN 'NAM. YOU OWE IT TO THEM (AND THE PRESIDENT) TO SEEK JUSTICE AND REVENGE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. TAKE IT, BECAUSE IT IS A DANGER TO YOURSELF IF YOU GO ALONE, SO BRING FRIENDS. NOT ME THOUGH, I'M BUSY.
4320	1	a	This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of our universe has to offer.  10/10
2650	1	a	It's fun!
474	1	a	With a sequel on its way, giving the first a play is a must, tower defense, with a first person twist, presented with PERFECTION, bloody good game =D
3077	1	a	When I bought the game like 1 year ago it was really just a piece of buggy junk. I got it for 50 cents in discount so I was't really angry. Yesterday I was looking at my steam library and I found ORION: Prelude. I was kinda confused (the game was originaly named ORION: Dino Horde) so I downloaded it again and Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥... They tweaked the game A LOT. It's still the same, same old weapons and vehicles, but it's polished. It really looks like the devs made a lot of improvement to the game. Some previously useless perks are now vital and guns are more responsive. Also, they added flying damage indicators, so you don't have to guess if you hit that one annoying pterodactyle or not. And the best thing is, IT'S FREAKING 79 CENTS!!! It will give you at least few hours of enjoyment and even if not, it's just 79 cents. 8/10
1352	1	a	Better than Shank 1.
6133	1	a	Fun game to play with friends :)
3033	1	a	Love this game. Bought it when it was on sale for .99 cents better than a lot of the 20 dollar games
4934	1	a	cool
4814	1	a	Very good but too laggy for my pc and can't be played on my mac.Enjoy if you're not stopped like me.
5076	1	a	METASCOREâ¡ is LYING !!!  Insanely fun coop survival / shooter game. Kill Dinos with bunch of guns and vehicles. ( Also lots of achievements for Achievement Hunters )
5698	0	a	this game is garbage. the ai is bad and the teradactals are s op you usually die from them.Also the guns are garbage and the dinos are just focused on the genorator and if it goes offline you loose.  so dont waste the dollar this game is this game should be .0000000000000000001$
5483	0	a	dis the worst gam eva
2544	1	a	Pew Pewing at Dinosaurs, what more could I ask for!
4037	1	a	Not ground-breaking, but not bad either. The devs have been really nice to the community, making continuous content updates and patches. It's fun to play with friends.
1064	1	a	Great game. Must-have tower defense game that incorporates third-person shooter very well. Strategy is very necessary then again so is character control. Sweeet!
3459	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
773	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a great mash up of action and strategy. The game can be played with either an action bent or a more strategic mind. As you unlock more weapons and traps, new strategies will become available making old levels fresh again.
1931	1	a	why did they rerelease on april 1st???!?!/1/1
4822	1	a	Halo, with Dinosaurs. Enough Said.
2600	1	a	Very well put game love it so much!! and P.S. help me i can't stop!!
1555	1	a	Pretty cool game until the last level. I couldn't beat it it was so hard.
2559	1	a	crazy fast paced gameplay combined with violent over the top dinos make this a very fun game it just may take a bit to get the setting rights on an older comp like I own
317	1	a	This game is so much fun, a combination of tactics and action that combines pretty well.   8/10
1495	1	a	In the distant future: the year 2000, a small alien named Zero is kidnapped from his home planet and taken to an underground science facility known as Black Aperture. He and his mysterious crystal-like companion begin to fight back against the cruel and unhumane scientists by doing cruel and unhumane things to them. Days passed and there was no sign of progress for Zero and his follower, the scientists and soldiers just seemed to keep coming back through the floorboards. Proabably beause they did. Zero was becoming very frustrated and began to question his allegiance, so he did what any logical alien with warping abilities would do. He played by the rules. He would concede to every guard he met and acted politely to everyone he met. But his follower didn't like this. So he got over it.  And you should too.
690	1	a	Awesome, and addicting, Great DLC, great gameplay, and it's really fun figuring out a good way to lay things out. If you like tower defense games, like DD, then this is the game for you!
6200	1	a	Quite good needs upgrades for all weapons not just all the weapons upgrade at the same time
612	1	a	
4963	1	a	its bad, you should try it
4296	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
2338	1	a	Super fun with friends. Rough around the edges but still really fun. For less than $3 100% recommend. Just buy the 4 pack and give it to your friends.
6261	1	a	This is probably the best game I have ever bought for a dollar! I mean its a dollar just give it a try! It has a few bugs but nothing game wrecking. Its like if you put Halo Spartans in Jurrassic Park and told them to blow everything up.
1257	1	a	Do you like killing orcs? what about gnolls, ogres and kobolds? what about using traps to cut them, pinch, burn, slice, throw, and crush them, all that sprinkled with some magic spells; kill orcs, be creative doing it, have fun.
2907	1	a	Slaying dino never felt so good.  The graphics is not so good but not so bad (1$ game, what you expect ?!). It is fun, it co-op, ROTFL mode on with this game. And 4-pack ? this game should consider 15-Pack. This game was way more fun if you played it with your close friend in the same room.
177	1	a	Not sure if this is a third-person tower defense game or a shooter game on steroids. Either way, ORCS  MUST  DIE!
870	1	a	  Strategy with action!
724	1	a	Yes they must.
4637	1	a	This game is like Turok on steroids. I really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes PvE games or dinosaur hunter type games.
3958	0	a	Probably one of the worst games ever made.
330	1	a	Orcs and more need to die.  Traps traps traps, kill kill kill Good fun.
1910	0	a	I got this game in a bundle. It isn't worth playing.
388	0	a	Unfunny; floaty and inaccurate gameplay; and forced mouse acceleration.
2384	1	a	I had this game for a while. It is pretty damn fun. Think Killing Floor with Dinos in the far future with vehicles and you get the idea.   Also while its on sale for 99 cents, why the hell not!?
5011	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.
1114	1	a	It is very fun. You can hear the Orcs say 'It's my last day before retirement' and than give him a headshot. But if you have (hopefully) friends that play video games i highly recommend you Orcs Must Die! 2, because this is a lot more fun in co-op!
4824	1	a	It a ok game i think it need to look more realistic and have more graphics good job on the way the game work tho keep it up the work .
1829	0	a	Worst game ever seen in the history of selling games. Maniability awful (target system and inerty extremely bad), soundtrack bad (I played with my music), no comment for graphics, and this is the concept of a flash game (some flash games are better AND FREE), I didn't see any fun in this game, but some people did, so maybe try it. If you want to rage and be frustated (I learnt I could be the most important rageous guy cause this game), buy it ONLY when it solded (0.19) but i advise you to go on Miniclip it's still better. It's a shame to sell this game 5 euros.... =/ And when some ennemies exploded, several big black square appear on your screen (=bug) and when plateforms become small, you can't see it cause these buggies. A shame 0.5/20 because there are plateforms
2274	1	a	This game is Awesome. You can drive cars and fly Helicoptors.
5905	1	a	It is awesome you can play multi-player single player co-op. i have played it for 23 hours in total. that is good for 79p      
5111	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
600	1	a	First off: Play this, even if its just the demo; don't be fooled by how easy the demo is --this game gets fairly difficult pretty quickly. And when you finish the story mode, you unlock Nightmare Mode, which involves hard versions of every level with more, tougher enemies, next-to-no downtime between waves, and no breather 'Unleash the Horde!' events. Great art, fantastic gameplay, witty dialogue. Completely worth its low price point.
5731	0	a	its bad
738	1	a	Honestly one of the best indie game i have had the chance to play, simple premices and tons of fun, the closest thing u'll find to a dungeon keeper, one of the rare games i just play after a bad day :) just makes me laugth and relaxes me, only thing i would say agaisnt it would be it's too bad they didn't addedd a coop mode, many dungeons you play woulda been perfect for a 2 man team, also it's too bad they didn't added a loot system, the game lends itself to collecting loot to upgrade ur war mage but unfortunatly they didn't go for that aspect, oh well can't have everything.
2704	1	a	25p each for 4 friends to shoot a T Rex in the face. What's not to like?
2547	1	a	I can't get enough of this game. I don't know what it was before but the Meta score is WAAAAAAAYYYYY off now. This is a great game. I got this game on sale and I love it so much I am buying in game Items just to support the developers!
5769	0	a	It feels like its missing a reason to play/continue playing other than to see how broken it feels.
3871	0	a	For a dollar, I would say give it a try. However, since a dollar isnt how much it usually is, I won't reccomend this game. Now, I've only played two gamemodes, but they seem to be the main ones, nor have i put much time into this game. But here goes my first thoughts.  First off, I'll go over Survival, a classic Horde-survival. However, it seems very broken and simple. While on top of a building, well out of reach of a Triceratops, it hit me and sent me flying, even though there was no way that could've possibly hit me. The raptors and compies are also far to easy to kill, as they are unable to jump to reach you. This gamemode seems simply to easy.  Now onto Rampage. The Dinosaurs attacks have simply HORRIBLE hit-markers. As a trex, I bit right on top of someone, but the game simply didnt count it. The eggs also simply floated in the air, sometimes out of reach for most dinosaurs, when the carrier was killed in mid-air. The vision was also weird for me, and sprinting doesn't seem to make anything move faster, but that's probably just me.  Overall, try the game for free if you have enough space and feel like it. However, I highly reccomend against this, as the game is pretty broken in several key-aspects at the moment.
4441	0	a	This game is unbalanced as HELL don't buy!!!!!!!
5722	0	a	This game says it can be \'used\' on windows 10 that is a lie it is also to laggy
1125	1	a	I don't know why orcs have to die :'( . It makes me sad...
6440	0	a	worst game ever so many glitches it never works dont get this game.
4305	1	a	Ran over a herd of velociraptors. 12/10
2205	1	a	I was shocked when I saw this game being sold for 0.99 â¬, so I decided to write a review. This game truly made a great leap in development and is an acceptable, fun and fast shooter with many game modes, maps, enemies and vehicles. Playing with friends is even more fun, and if you're not interested in dinosaurs, you can disable them, receiving a normal FPS game.  I'm very sorry for the developers, who optimized this game instead of just dropping it. It's sad that you are able to earn more cash with an unfinished, bad and buggy 'Early Access' game than actually with a real good game... :c
5643	0	a	The only game I know where you can lose connection to the host while soloing.
1501	0	a	Love the concept and it's kind of fun, but. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ frames, weird controls and Origin... I don't mind Origin i use it from time to time, But i much prefer steam, that's why i bought the game on steam.
5714	0	a	i pay for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ !!! now its free... fku dev team...
4583	1	a	$1. $1 $1 $1. ...... it's still better than advanced warfare 
3854	0	a	Hardly any servers to go on, single-player is boring as hell, and the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. 4/10
2764	1	a	I played this solo. A Dinosaur bit my gentleman's specialty off and as I was bleeding out it ran away.  Of course, I died. These dinosaurs don't hang around like the mooks do on Borderlands, waiting to kill you. That suggests Dinosaurs are cleverer than the populace of Pandora.  8/10, would have my particulars bitten off again.
3510	1	a	I'm shooting giant crocodiles with tanks, buy it now it's on sale.
2882	0	a	This game is awful. Now I know what you're gonna say, 'How is it bad if you played it for less than an hour?' That's true, but it is extremely laggy, god-awful with a controller, and graphics are terrible.
2045	1	a	wait what  why am I having fun
4626	0	a	Not bad but the animations are a 'bit' weird and not worth 11 â¬,i would take primal carnage and dino d day any day of the week..

4492	1	a	Got It Free Cant Really Run It Got Bad Specs
2120	1	a	So here is my review on this game. I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.  Then I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.  The game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!  One big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.  Also, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with 'updates' like most games. 'You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items.' A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.  Overall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.
1186	1	a	Awesome and fun game! Killing orcs is simply amazing!
397	0	a	The sequel is better in every way possible. Avoid this.
321	1	a	Though there barely ain't any, the plot is quite ok and VERY FUNNY. Stuff you can use without DLC is ok, but with DLC it's just amazing. Main Char is nice.   Get it with the DLC and it will be epic awesome despite the lack of co-op or any kind of multiplayer mode.   P.S. So much fun making catapults combos.
3960	1	a	Decent game, good with friends
2635	1	a	Onion:Shreklude &lt;--- thats how i feel about this game. &lt;3

4907	1	a	GET THIS GAME...just do it.....its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice
3824	1	a	Unlike most steam reviewers, my review is about this game. Which I really like and have found it to be very refreshing and fun regardless of the problems. This developer obviously cares about us as players and I've witnessed the game evolve in all the ways it needed to from suggestions of players and fans.  Great Memories from playing with friends. Everyone hoping on a vehicle and the driver drives everyone off a cliff and we all die even though we were all wearing jetpacks. Classic!  The gameplay is straight forward. Kill dino's in waves, get money, buy upgrades, go out on a remote mission, come back &amp; kill dinos in waves. If your generator goes down Repair!  There is nothing quite like fighting a slew of mini dino's to look up and see T-Rex chomping down on your head, or getting that last pistol bullet into a dino right before you die for a self rez. Or getting that last Dino down while all your friends have fallen and are watching you complete the wave.  This game is awesome, great fun, great memories, and refreshing to see a developer that cares and a game that grows.
2305	1	a	It's kind of a glitchy game, worth a dollar. Graphics are 'ok' but still good enough to have fun.
1783	1	a	Fun little platformer game similar to Mario. It did not work properly at first. My game was only partially visible. Playing it in windowed mode solved the problem. Worth getting on sale.
4784	0	a	played this and immediately hated myself for even buying it. 10/10 whould buy again.
513	1	a	A unique twist in the tower defense genre, charming character design and personality, amazing gameplay and it's just too damn fun to play. Buy this now
3453	1	a	Classic survival game,can be fun with a friend and there is a lots of achievements for hunters!Graphics are not that bad there is a day and night cycle and rainy weather.8/10
5932	1	a	A cool combination of star wars and dinasours. you can play survival mode, team deathmatch and lots of other modes, but i mostly recomend the survival mode. It is a fun game to play with friends. I thimk it can get pretty boring after a while, but for the ridiculous price, it's totaly worth it! The game runs pretty very well onmostly computers, and has good framerate. You don't need a very powerful computer to run the game in high quality. It has a few bugs with the motion of dinosours, but it is not so much that it makes the game worse. I rate this game 8/10
2665	1	a	I'ts worth .99 cent but that's all I'm going to say about it.
1688	1	a	Simple and easy to follow and the controls are simple as well.  Simple game, simple layout, simple enemies.  'Simple' losses its meaning after a while while playing.   11/10 'Would kill a bot and throw the corpse at other bots again'
1279	1	a	A decent, but safe and familiar, twin stick shooter that takes a little while to get interesting. The later levels are more fun and provide enough of a challenge to entertain me.  6.5/10
1573	1	a	Eh, It is a resonably decent tower defense game. However nothing really stands out about it. Pretty basic, nothing terribly special or interesting
4260	0	a	all comments in trailer are lies. this game is not worth to 1 dollar... lets just end it there...
3813	1	a	worst game I ever played, 12 out of 10
4521	0	a	This is absolute trash. Avoid.
6425	1	a	This game has everything; Dinosaurs, a store for buying needless objects in real money, characters modeled after women in their 40's, Guns and weapons loadouts, no storyline, online survival and team deathmatch, vehicles. yes, its got a tank! Better than halo's 2-5, not better than tribes.  I played this game twice today, had fun both times. Not sure how to feel about this one.  
2447	0	a	Turn away. Now.
2489	0	a	Wow this is bad. I didn't plan on even testing this out until I read some reviews and decided to try it for the weekend trial. Wow what a mistake. I played a whole 30 minutes of this and knew this was garbage. This game has numerous basic gameplay issues. Just to start off, you can't properly remap your keys and the keys displayed in the control settings don't correctly state what key something is currently bound to... Shooting a gun has some sort of a lag from when you actually click and the gun shoots to when you see your weapons recoil/flash... Everything is scaled horribly, it's like they had no regard for what things should look like. You'll have dinosaurs ranging from mouse size to giant size, vehicles, buildings and consoles all look like they took a whole 5 minutes slapping something together... I honestly knew what I was getting into when I looked at this game and other reviewers made me think otherwise. I am honestly more dissapointed at the Steam community for all the 'recommendeds' for this pile of dinosaur crap. Don't waste your time on this, even for a $1 there are much more polished games out there.   Metacritic got this one right. Heed my warning, stay away.
4703	1	a	This game's best quality (its price) is also its worst. Nobody knows how to play. Nobody seems to have their sound/monitors on to hear/see the giant 'Objective: 0%' sign in front of their faces. Nor can anyone hear 'protect the generator'. Its fascinating, really. Its like I'm playing this game on Xbox Live.
4322	0	a	its not even like they genuinly tried, its just such a lazy game.
3014	1	a	What do you when we gain access to a time machine that allows us to go back in time and visit dinosaurs  Why we shoot them of course we want to make them go extinct before the astroid does  6 dinosaurs out of 10 dinosaurs
2999	1	a	If you enjoy FPS games and horde action games   Orion: prelude is for you. All you need to know  Kill dinosaurs. Survive. Kill more dinosaurs.
4624	1	a	really good game.. the rate of this game is not updated.. really fun worth the 1$
276	1	a	Great looks, performance, humor, MUSIC and action!! Do not miss this game!
3802	0	a	tired of seeing this damn game in my library as free or in a deal. this game is trsah hence why its 1 dollar and they keep making this deals.dont get anddont waste your time.
3028	1	a	8/10. A few bugs, but still really fun.
3402	1	a	If this game was an old dog, i'd have it put down. 10/10 will never play again.
4334	1	a	An absolutely awesome game to play with friends whether it's a co-op survival against a horde of dinosaurs or a deathmatch between players. Although this game has quite afew bugs and things that they should improve on, I would definitely recommend this game to a friend!
5061	0	a	boring chaos
5053	0	a	I hated the first ten minutes of it.
703	1	a	My favorite tower-defense game as of now. No co op unlike others, but it doesn't spoil the fun.  Approximately 20 levels with 3 different difficulty settings, nice graphics and charme. Wide variety of traps/spells/npcs to help you kill ALL the orcs!
2112	1	a	Long story short ORION: Prelude (Competitive PvP) was the original game announced in 2010, a spiritual successor to the ORION: Source Beta. It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel).   With the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles). Comparison:  Original Prelude / Modern Prelude 3 Modes / 15 Modes 5 Dinosaurs / 10 Dinosaurs (All Playable) 30 Weapons&amp;Gear / 50 Weapons&amp;Gear 5 Multiplayer Maps / 20+ Multiplayer Maps &amp; SDK  It is now called ORION: Prelude because it *finally* is ORION: Prelude.

2220	1	a	Nice game but it has some things that could be done better but the benefit that it's a cheap game makes it good. :)
5628	0	a	Don't buy, This game is a waste of money. If you do you will lag out like hell.
2700	1	a	This game is worth more then just a dollar! If you own a steam account you should own this game. It has multiplayer rpg levels and rewards with over two hundrend fifty achievements. Many different game modes and even play as dinosaurs. Multiplayer games are fun and easy to host or play solo with bots.
3757	1	a	This game is so bad BUT if u want to have fun with ur friends u goota try this out ! If u like to own dinos by trickshotting or quickscoping them this is ur game :D
4078	1	a	This is a good game. Maybe even great. It sure isn't the best game in the world, but it's certainly worth playing.   I don't care about what this game was called before or any negatie reviews. I sure as hell don't care about Activision going after the other ORION game. This is not that game.  Picked this game up on a sale for 50 cents. Haven't tried the PvP modes, but right now I've sunk about 30 hours into the PvE wave mode. Sure the bots are absolutely terrible, the graphics aren't at Crytek levels, and it gets fairly repetitive, but I've enjoyed all 30 hours. The survival mode is fairly simple: defend a generator for three waves, move to capture an outpost somewhere on the map, repeat twice, then finish with a final tenth wave. The waves of small enemies, ground and airborne, are accompanied by a few very large, very strong dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurs and Stegosaurs. The game can be very challenging or very easy depending on the settings. A personal favorite of mine is to turn the dino health down and spawn rate up to dramatically increase the size of the wave.   Recomending a game is all about the value-proposition. Do you get a sufficient amount of enjoyment for what you pay? I payed 50 cents for currently 30 hours of game. That's a 60 hour per value ratio. 60 hours per dollar is equivalent to 3600 hours in your standard $60 AAA game. Very few people spend 360 hours on a game, much less 3600. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Even if I don't play another hour of this game, the value of my 50 cents is apparent.
6088	0	a	It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off.   The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage.  The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective.  On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do.  Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.
694	1	a	Fun game with good strategy components, but with an overall action feel. It allows the player to choose a field control, crowd control or more basic hack and slash approach to the level. Not a lot of replayability, but worth a couple of bucks to play.
6431	1	a	best game for co-op, the classes are so much fun to learn. 10/10 best played with friends  can play solo but not as much fun then with friends fusion between planetside, jurassic park, and halo
5207	0	a	Pile of crap
2487	0	a	This is not done well. The animations suck, the dinosaur movements are bad, and the guns don't kick enough. There is no tutorial, so you're thrown in with no idea how to play. I like the concept of a survival game based on dinosaurs, but this is not what I want. Besides, fighting dinosaurs as a Halo reject isn't cool. Couldn't we get something like Jurassic Park stlye characters?
5860	0	a	The game is broken. 2 out of 3 times I tried opening this game it put me in a black screen, in which I could not alt+tab out of it. When I did get it to work it was impossible to join a friend's game lobby, since either it could not be found, or when I could find it and joined the lobby it put me in a blank screen. Not even worth $.50.
6450	1	a	HOW ON GALLIFREY'S NAME DID HUMEN'S TIME TRAVEL I WHENT 100 TRILLION YEARS TO THE FUTURE AND BACK AND THAY HAD NO TIME TRAVEL!!!! im going to meet them. TO THE TARDIS!!! #TIMEHUMENS

4434	0	a	you gotta kill the dinosaurs but like all you gotta do is get a choppa then its GG so don't buy this POS if you wanna play for any more than likeeeeee 2 or 3 hrs 4/10
1630	0	a	Terrible, i enjoyed 5 seconds and then went back to play team fortress
5776	0	a	When the T-Rex roars your ears will bleed, no matter your sound settings.  12/10
1591	1	a	Great fun for a tower def game! Got it via MacLife deal but it's worth it based on it's own merits
1669	1	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is by far one of the most curious games I have played in a long time. Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical. I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.
1381	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
943	1	a	Hell O' Game!! Definate replay value here. Reminds me of what Plants Vs Zombies would look like in 3D.
1363	1	a	This game kinda reminds me of Metal Slug
1489	0	a	It's a fun game but the EA login killed it for me. It doesn't remember my account and have to recover password every time because it doesn't accept my credentials.
1551	1	a	A really tiny game and the story is simple: you are a alien. You are caught by a scienist group when you fell onto Earth and they attempt to 'look inside' you. Your power is peeled and you need to get your power back and escape from the lab.   Yet the game is very attractive in its idea. The ailen is able to walk through items( including humans ) in order to escape from traps, gunfires and deadly mechine. You need to think where to hide, where to put the items and where to go first in order to get to your destination?   As a Indie game, it is no compare to those 'big company' product, but the presentation and the creativity are really impressive.   If you are looking for a tiny fun game to smile and think, get this one and you wont regret.
6207	1	a	....
4225	0	a	Concept is great, but all I got while playing it was a game designed for human characters, with poor handling on the dinosaurs and other reptiles. Difficult to navigate and figure out how to play in the first place.
6417	1	a	Shoot at some damn dinosaurs for a little bit and some wierd f-in robots and Santa and idk some other stuff. This game is a mix of Borderlands/Killing Floor/ and Halo but not as great as any of those titles. With that being said, it's worth getting and fun to play for the price so just buy it you loser
2982	1	a	Hello its me, Ive been recomending games like this since black ops 3 to go over everything, For only 1 dollar this game is such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ steal, BUY IT NOW OR YOU WILL SEE, HOW BLACK OPS 2 IS MW3333333333333333, AND I recomed this game
516	1	a	Does not suck, much fun had by myself and others.
2388	1	a	ONION: Dino Hoes has no onions  10/10 broke it
1390	1	a	Play this if you just want to have some senseless violence
625	1	a	Many Orcs died making this game.
111	0	a	Cannot change volume
6370	1	a	Pretty damn great, but some things are way better than others... *ahem* rockets with all upgrades *ahem*. Buying this soon, its like a 50$ game
4350	1	a	As a man of simple tastes, this game strikes my interests at heart. I like shooting and blowing things up, and I also have a tender love for dinosaurs. When I saw this game, a game where these two interests collide, I bought it. I have not regretted it one bit. Although the game doesn't have the amazing technical aspects of other shooters, it still retains the fundamental goal of the game; make dinosaurs playable and shootable. That's all I need.
6348	1	a	While the game started pretty badly, it has evolved into one of the msot dynamic, fun filled games for sometimes under $1.  This is a must have game for every account.
6029	0	a	Awful game. Just terrible...
4201	1	a	The idea behind the game is awesome! The game itself ... not so much... Support the KickStarter they are bringing up i think on the 27th i have high hopes for this company and expect them to do well!   But this is what i think of Dino Horde  Buy while its onsale for 1$!! Not for 15$! Why?  The game is poorly optimized for one, the crosshairs on weapons are the same color as the winter enviroment so it's difficult to even aim at anything unless you are using something you can hip fire with the PvP is bad because any sort of lag just is killer lag is handeled very poorly. The 'Open' World map they released theres no sense of freedom in it all it is, is a bigger survival map with nothing to do between points i did run in to a t-rex once out side of a point that was fun but out of every other time i played i never once ran in to any real engaging fights.

3131	1	a	it was a real fun game! i enjoyed playing it!!
982	1	a	Nice game to waste some time. The challenges can be realy hard depending on the equipment you chose. I recommend you get the DLC 'Artifacts of Power' as it contains 2 very powerfull items. Overall its a realy good tower defence game where you sometimes have to fight on more than one frontline at the same time.
6082	0	a	I got this game for .99 cents.. Its worth that much to be honest. Don't buy this game unless its dirt cheap.
4084	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
5282	1	a	Awesome as â¥â¥â¥â¥, says this Massive Duck
3892	0	a	This game actually sucks. Bugs, bugs and more bugs. DONT BUY
3843	1	a	I have SO much fun on this game. So many play styles, and it NEVER gets boring. Just more dinosaurs please!
3461	0	a	this game lags on my god computer, with glitchy dinos bad servers and weapons that feel as unsatifying and hard to aim as possible. the game mecanics arte repetive and often break. i went int this agem thinking this look reasonably good. NO dont even try. its all well and good adding more items and features they are good and its a good idea but they need to fix the gameplay and i dont think they would be able to address thewse issued as they would probibly have to rebuild the engine. F*** no never again.   as of 25th feb 2014 (i dont think it will improve)
5685	0	a	Game doesnt open, just says its running. Yes i ended the process in task manager, which had no effect. I reinstalled it, deleted appchache, restarted PC/Steam. Nothing is working and i found no information on how to fix this issue.
6224	1	a	Buggy and boring, â¥â¥â¥â¥ ass gameplay and not worth a dollar  11/10 awesome game
743	1	a	Amazingly addictive and fun to play.
1519	1	a	if you are going to buy, GET A CONTROLLER ON YOUR COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY!!
6472	1	a	AWESOME GAME better than cod zombies the only reason to hate this game is beacuase you are fighting DINOSAURS, which some may percieve as stupid. but this game maintains to still be awesome and be WAAAAAAY under priced. Also it has good graphics fluency. It is REALLY HARD. but you can make it easy 9.5/10
2756	1	a	Is it perfect? No. Is it a Triple A game? Nah son. Are the dinosaurs smart and tactile, like most dinosaurs were? You bet your â¥â¥â¥ they aren't.  The game is a dollar. You can kill freakin' dinosaurs with lasers and light sabers and grenades and â¥â¥â¥â¥. No, it's not the amazing FPS dinosaur game every kid that grew up watching Jurassic Park wants, but it's still cheap and fun for a while. The one thing I absolutely hate about this game is the audio. The guns sound like they have ZERO power. When I shoot a velociraptor in the face with a shotgun, I want my ears to vibrate from the loud blast coming out of my headphones. Aside from the â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor sound fx, the game is worth your dollar. Besides, what else are you going to buy for a dollar? A candy bar? That'll be gone in 2 minutes unless you lose it in your couch cushions. Buy ORION: Prelude instead.
4287	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
980	1	a	OMD plays a little like Sanctum, but with a greater focus on personal power and less on mazing. The engine also has several physics based traps enabling you to reposition the creeps, enabling fun things like flinging orcs back to the beginning of your kill corridor or tossing them up to the top of a wall covered in instruments death to tumble back down it in bloody chunks. The only bad thing I can really say about this game is that there's no co-op.  Highly reccommended if you even have only a passing interest in TD games.
5350	1	a	hello friend this game is um pretty sweet you know what i'm sayin but it's like idk pretty lame so yeah
407	1	a	Great combination of action and tower defense.
548	1	a	Put down some traps and rip thousands of orcs apart in this awesome game. Not exactly tower defence, but its something similar.
4472	0	a	Before I begin, I would like to point out that I can run Far Cry 3 on high graphics.   This game could be great. It already would be great, if not for one killer - fps. On low everything, this game lags like hell, and my gun appears to be hovering in my hands, which often go through it. Also, there are no tutorials. I know you can probably find them online somewhere, but it would be nice if there was an optional one you could participate in if you needed to. I really tried to enjoy this game, but the fps, which was probably about 7, ruined my experience.   When they fix the fps problems and major lag, then, and only then, will this be a reccomendation.  It will be an awesome game when that happens. But for now, it is terrible.
5704	0	a	Finally got into a match and proceeded to fall through the floor multiple times
2063	1	a	BEEP is a very good puzzle game! I recommend it! I love the gravity gun!
1896	1	a	I think this small, cheap game is great to kill some time. The music is stunning and the visuals are simple, yet charming. I like this game alot and play it from time to time.
5529	0	a	well this game should be free it cost 72 cents? really? make it free plz
2296	1	a	It plays like Halo! It's got Dinosaurs but it's a breakfast cereal! 
6262	1	a	I need a better PC to play this game but it's definately worth while!
2760	1	a	HELP!!! I can't move because my head spinns
1300	1	a	This game ought to have more attention. Side scrolling hack and slash, manly death heterosexual warfare. The only game I can think of in which a solution to a shark attack is ripping its jaws out from its mouth. Over the top violence without being lol edgy.
3829	1	a	Survival mode is very fun with a friend. There are a number of balancing issues and bugs but these don't really spoil the game. The game is so cheap that I would recommend ignoring metacritic's outdated review and giving it a try.
3887	0	a	This game has its moments, and it might be fun for the first 7 miliseconds but after that it gets rediculous, sadly the game had some potential. It has exciting graphics, and thats it! Don't even get me started about the 'eaten mechanics'. The game also suckers us (the consumers) into buying it with its few over-average screenshots. Please dont buy this....
2415	1	a	10/10 it's ok
3293	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
1515	0	a	It's not Portal -- that 's for sure. Stupid people just should refrain from making puzzles. Beat it in a few hours. Challenge mode leaderboards are polluted with hackers' fake records.
3013	1	a	It's a terrifically fun game that's one dollar and people still feel entitled enough to complain about it on metacritic.  10/10
4238	1	a	LIGHTSABERS AND DINOSAURS (The game still has bug's) 10/10
4981	0	a	Polish a turd it's still a turd. Wouldn't recommend for anybody.
3639	1	a	Downloaded the game 4 days ago but only played it today. First match we were doing pretty well, holding off the dino's and progressing steadily. We then have to take an outpost. On our way there, my friend and I ran into a Triceratops in our 4x4. It rams us and we are sent flying across the map, we fly off the cliff and land on the side of the mountain, where we somehow remained alive. We manage to fall through the mountain and we are glitched into a cave. Our entire team rapidly failed and we were the only 2 left. Took us 10 minutes to discover we could teleport home, and when we did we lead the charge and emerged victorious. 5/10 opinion not yet fully developed...
2565	1	a	This game is amazing, the guns are great and it's so many choices, they have tanks and flying stuff D: AND Its the best multiplayer game i've ever played
3553	1	a	better than sex
5225	0	a	i dont know how this has any good reviews save the change
2694	1	a	You are in a SUV killing off dinos when a trex spawns and hits ur car....the car flyes off into the sunset (off teh map) and u win the round by unknown reasons. 10/10
2231	1	a	no one told me it had dinosaurs, completely misleading.
3040	1	a	One of the games that comes with a ''Buy ME'' tag on. Easy to play and fun FPS.
6322	1	a	a really great game
5817	1	a	This game is like Killing Floor,but for autistic halo spartans with the aim control of a stormtrooper.   Its like bad,but not the good type of bad  Its like Halo,but not Halo  Its like Dota 2,but without the Dota and the 2  Its like Call of Duty,but more teamwork  Its like watching cartoons,but all of it is Hebrew dubbed  Imagine a world,where anything you do makes u go into The Matrix  Think of a really good cupcake,then later during the digestive process it gives u AIDS  Think of a newborn,cute baby girl,and it dies when it sees your face  Imagine if a Holocaust documentary,was funny as all hell  And last,think about moshing at a Wiggles Concert  Its that hardcore...... 9 chopped of Dino-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ outa/10
5822	1	a	nice game for couple hours of gaming or when you bored and very cheap 8/10
2186	1	a	ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.  This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.  To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.  Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.  Pros and Cons.  Pros:  *The game is fairly cheap. *The community is not dead for now. *The developers may fix all the issues at some point. *The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts. *The graphics are quite nice for the price *You get a cute little shooter for 99 cents  Cons: *Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever. *The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows. *The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen *The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars. *The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater. *Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard. *combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.   I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following.   My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming
5900	1	a	fun game to mess around in and its so cheep
3427	0	a	Wonky Animations and Low Res Menus that will make your eyes bleed.  ****/10
6205	1	a	An amazingly open combat game, reccomended to those into amazing dinosaurs like the Raptor, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops. I had a great time playing it, even though I died a lot. Also, is it just me, or do the soldier guys look like they're in Dead Space 3 armor?
2566	1	a	great game
4271	1	a	I never enjoy buying games. But I got pressured into buying this because of my friends. I was thinking 'It'll probably be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game but it's just a doller.' But holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ was I wrong. This game has a major lack of fun when it's singleplayer but the fun is all in co-op. 10/10 dank meme m8.
1832	1	a	Super cute. Just a fun little Mario-inspired side scroller, with a side of Wall-E.
1132	1	a	Approved!
2441	0	a	This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.  This game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing name of their game whenever they release a 'big update'. This game was and still is a buggy pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ since launch and despite these 'big updates' the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.  So what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).  Presentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.  But ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.  So it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it.
1002	1	a	Nice, mindless fun. In the game you play as a war mage that kills orcs. You get cool traps and a few weapons. It's quite satisfying to play too. Only downside is lack of multiplayer, which is present in the second installment - Orcs Must Die! 2. If this game is on sale, I reccoment getting it. Also, getting this game will grant you 10 extra co-op levels in OMD2, however you have to note that both players need this game for them to be playable in the co-op mode.
3612	1	a	Okay so this game is pretty cheesy, let me warn you. But that's what happens when you have a Republic Commando-esque soldier firing a bow or wielding some kind of lightsaber against a T-Rex. Also, one of the reviews the devs chose to display on the trailer said 'Its not buggy anymore.' So it has that going for it.  Anyways, lots of fun, better with friends, graphics are a bit pitiful but not terrible generally. Except for the 'water.' Definately worth the 99 cents I paid for it, probably not worth the 15 it normally is. Also, you can explore dino innards.
5672	0	a	Okayish game, horrible devs. Changing the name of their game, TWICE, to avoid bad metacritic scores. Stealing assets. Playing the victim after Activision calls them out on it and slaps them with a DMCA notice. Pretending to take the high ground by saying 'I won't retaliate against Activision' and then writing walls of text doing exactly that. Laying employees off after taking their work. Threatening to sue the 'kids' of reddit for all they're worth. Throwing a temper tantrum and saying 'OMG I WAS HACKED BY ANONYMOUS.' 'Flexible funding' on indiegogo and then funding the required $500 themselves. Deleting negative comments and anyone who disagrees with them the slightest. How anyone could continue to support him is beyond me. I'm returning these products immediately and I encourage everyone to do the same.
2777	1	a	First off the meta score is a little low for this game it is way more fun than you might think it does need lots more work.
2731	1	a	The studio made an AMAZING job on this game and the remake of it, I would recommend this to all my friends, and I don't understand how they make money by selling it for so cheap?!   In all seriousness, I spent less than a dollar for this game, and its more fun than most of my games in my library! It has a great feeling when played, I only have very minor complaints!  -extremely large gun models -Cliffs like being buggy -no direct Steam connectivity  Other than that the game is amazing!  8.4/10.0
525	1	a	A Tower Defense pretty fun recommanded if you like that style of game !
1732	1	a	Me : Hey i bought BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP Friend : wut ? Me : BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP Friend : whats kind of game is that ? me : u control your beeeeeeeeeeeeepppppp friend : -_-  10/10 best name ( it worths his price tag , when i am bored and i have no idea what to play .... just ..... beeeeeeeeeeepp)
2762	1	a	Even though the meta score is 36 its still a great game.
626	1	a	actually amazing, I thought it might be basic garbage but the story is nice, the main character is fun, it feels really good to watch him get down when you get a perfect score, it is actually very well made and thought out and I loved it, some of the traps were stupid useless but all of them were pretty dam cool
5442	0	a	This may be the literal worst thing on steam. I think it's definitely a contender at the very least.
2790	1	a	This game can't be compared to Dino Beatdown. Yes! It's created by the same developer, but once you play ORION: Dino Horde you'll get to see that Spiral Game Studios really took the negative reviews directly to the chin and practiced what the community demanded from Dino Beatdown - Put that into consideration. Also people that purchased Dino Beatdown received this game for free.  More and more free content has been added to this game, so it's pretty clear that Spiral Game Studios is working on it.  So how's this game? Well first off you need some people you can rely on playing with, I mean proper teammates. They should be able to revive you when you're incapacitated. Since there are big dinosaurs you'll trying to avoid them with your jetpack and you'll freak out for a moment since you don't know whether the Spinosaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex can reach you or not when you're in the air!  If Spiral Game Studio is reading this - Please consider supporting Steam Workshop!  Peace.
454	1	a	Its a Nice TD With a twist. ITS SO FUNNY XD and mass killing is fun fun fun 
4987	0	a	Is boring!
1077	1	a	[]V[]ega-worth getting. Fun, challenging, quick, and easy to play. Challenge yourself and compare to me!!! Buy this game!
2869	1	a	Fun and addicting shooter. Worth a try.
1355	1	a	Shank 2 is the bomb, quite literally. Itâs an action packed title, filled to the brim with tons of gratification, a beautiful outline, tight controls and great replay value. Cynics can argue that it doesnât offer a ton more than the first game, but itâs still just as appealing as it ever was, now with more stuff.   Full Review  [www.noobfeed.com] .
158	1	a	A nice little take on the tower defense and the third person shooter genres. The only draw back outside of the weapon DLC being a bit overpriced for what it gives you is that the main charecters limited repitor of speech files can get a bit grating after a few levels. But if you like tower defense games or even Dungeon Defenders but wished it's single player was better you will like this game.
5216	1	a	You can kill a T-Rex 10/10
5298	0	a	this game sucks
4888	1	a	  DOPE game for 99 cents....
5425	1	a	good game, much yes. 12/10
2495	1	a	I haven't had this much fun eating someone as a giant monster, since the original Natural Selection's Onos.
5478	0	a	its the same game it was befor hense the 59 pence, if u have a very bad pc, and u can not get good fps on most of them games out there, this is for you. but for 59p (GBP) u can not complain, be sure to see this on andriod lol their last market
41	1	a	Nice twist on poker. I liked it
1294	1	a	Shank 2 is not a thing to remember for long, but the things it brings are undoubtedly bloody, crazy, weird and, best of all, entertaining like the first game. Although it's a slightly crippled remake of Shank, it's still good, but the gameplay just seems icky when compared to its superior predecessor.        Shank 2 - Ad&nbsp;
6453	1	a	It's inspiring to see what SPIRAL have done with this game. It would be nice to see other developers (especially the ones that have poorly made early access titles and false promises) take a hint from them.
1189	1	a	extra fun with controller
3188	1	a	Who doesn't love blowing up dino brains with their friends? 10/10 hands down one the best co-op games ever!
4757	1	a	Got this game i dont know why steam counts hours wrongly i've played it for 900hours its worth the price its loads of fun even though it has some glitches i bought this 4pack 30times to support the developers :)
2445	0	a	Regret: The game  what seems like an awesome concept becomes boring after 10 minutes. Avoid like the plague.
50	1	a	The map is a bit cumbersome, but overall this is a very good game. If you like the original Puzzle Quest, you'll probably like this.
1024	1	a	Really an amazing game. Various traps, various abilities, various unlockables, and TONS of replayability. So many levels, difficulties, scores, orcs,... Stop reading this and get it.
119	1	a	Fun game which offers a fresh take on the tower-defense genre. By putting you in the middle of the fray there is never a dull moment. The monsters are fun, the traps are fun, the character is fun and the gameplay is challenging and (wait for it) fun. What more could you expect? If you catch this game during a steam-sale you should definately give it a try.
4397	1	a	They have a Turok reference in Achievements  15/10
6294	0	a	THIS GAME SUCK BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!! THANKS GOD IT'S ONLY ONE DOLLER
5110	1	a	10/10 like work  thanks :yay: good! all Rush buy  all -off summer sale
3286	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
853	1	a	Awesome Defense - type game. It has lots of replayality.
2886	0	a	Bad Game, worst Server Browser. Canr recommand this Game to anyone.
605	1	a	This is a great game and I am really enjoying playing it. It's basically a FPS &amp; Tower Defense game. Your job is to prevent the orcs from reaching the rift. If too many do, you lose the level.  The orcs come at you in 'waves' and you have different ways of defending yourself. From traps to extra support (guardians). The key to success in the game is choosing the right traps in the level as well as placing them strategically.   
5479	0	a	my teamate was a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot, pretty sure he was playing from the childrens hospital for being such a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot WHO WOULD NOT REVIVE ME.
623	1	a	I think this game is not only strategy but also need a speed to click your mouse to defeat the ORCS
2871	1	a	I stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a sword. 10/10
5325	0	a	This is just my less-than-a-hour look at this and I must say it is no where ready for being released. It seems that this was rushed to be released without anywhere near a finished product. With no guidance or help, I started a game and became completely lost as to what I was to do next. After wondering around for a bit I stumbled on what seemed to be the right combo to get things going. Next thing I knew, after about 3 or 4 waves of creatures, I ended up in a LARGE wave with at least two T-Rex (boss) level creatures. And lots of other sized creatures. The game is confusing and slipshod... At least all of this is just my opinion after playing less than an hour. I think if they gave this more time then maybe it would be worth playing...
2343	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
3546	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
3604	0	a	Welcome to the dark side of indie games! Where games have little effort placed into them and we do our very damndest to make Minecraft's money because we can't make anything else but blocks!  'OMFG!!! Peetor! u fokn wot m8?! u oly hav 10 hrs in dis musterpeese!' hold your horses! I'm doing the internet a favor by reviewing this game! I'm surprised I played this for 2 days without drinking acid. Have I played 10 hours? yes, is it enough to review a game with a fair amount of game modes to choose from? no. But, this game is being sold off as a 'Unreal Tournament/Halo/Quake/Star wa-- wait wait wait! What?! Star wars? you mean to tell me a light saber knock off is enough to count this as a Star wars game? who rated this? 12 year old's? I'm sorry but the only thing that makes Orion related to those games are: regenerating health (Halo) and vehicles (Unreal Tournament) As for Quake, I'm not even sure what sticks out as being inspired by Quake...If you're talking about the rocket launcher...Sorry kiddies, but almost every shooter has a rocket launcher, so I guess Halo. Half-life. Unreal Tournament. Dues Ex. Doom. Battle Field. Star Wars: Battle Front, etc. Are   all   Quake clones.  This is a ADS game with   zombies   Dinosaurs and classic PvP. But that does not mean that this game is anything like what I have just listed! Do not f***ing confuse good games with this buggy indie mess!     the gameplay
4764	1	a	-10/10 beats cod and bf4 grafics togeter -its hard to learn the mechanics (like master yi )  -it cost a lot more than killing floor 2  -community filled woth 10 year old kids  -is no fun  -BUY IT

6282	1	a	The raptors are too smart in this game. Before we knew it, they had learned to talk. They ridiculed our plan of rebooting the system. Then they started using guns! Our only chance was to get to the weapons closet for more gun but the Raptors found it first. They even emailed us to let us know they found it. Smug raptor jerks.   Overall this is a great game because it's nothing remotely like Jurassic Park. There aren't even raptors in it!!!  Happy Raptor Hunt! Chomp Chomp!
1078	1	a	this game it the â¥â¥â¥â¥ its a must buy
5675	0	a	Lol dev is trash hate this game
6099	1	a	Pretty cool game, un polished in a lot of areas. But for the type of game it is, it handles pretty well.
5598	1	a	How can I review this game I don't even own it.
930	1	a	Quite fun game of a first person shooter/tower defense hybrid, and lots of possible combinations for causing mayhem!
6084	1	a	I get so wrapped up when I play this game. I do wish there were more dinosaurs though, but I'm sure they will come along eventually. Also I wish there were more gun choices for primary. I love the SMG, it's my favorite. It's difficult even with a group of friends, lol. Those pesky little dinos &amp; the flying ones, ugh! But all in all, I REALLY like this game. Doesn't help that I got it for .99 cent ;)
3800	0	a	Very very good game! glitched around in a car for 20 minutes. 11/10 would play again.
2379	1	a	Cheap and Good ^^
1898	1	a	WALL-E was back
1014	1	a	An addictive 3rd person strategy defense romp. This game throws you into the role of the last warmage defending rift portals against waves of orcs, ogres, goblins and more. The maps make you think carefully about where to place your arsenal of various traps. Traps such as brimstone which scorches the ground or your very own army of elven archers. Some clever cutscenes placed here and there give emphasis on a story, uncommon in this genre. To add to longevity each map has 3 difficulties, leaderboards, and skulls you must earn to improve your traps.  A fantastic game for any fan of action or strategy games!
1431	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
3295	1	a	Okay, now you are sitting here looking at the trailer for the game and see its like a dollar USD... I got it on sale for .50 cents just because I like to collect random steam games. After seeing some of the cool mech and helicopters I decided to try this, mainly out of bordom... then it happend.... im flying around, blasting t-rexs in the face with machineguns and rockets and had to keeping, The only thing I really dont like is how the dinos look. Theother things such as the terran, buildings and mechs like unique awesome and theh multi player is not horrible!  Do it... spend a dollar and have fun!
3296	1	a	I seriously can't recomend this game enough. I don't know why I havn't written this review Earlier, I've had teh Game since day one and have watched it grow from it's pretty rough and shaky start into one of the most fun Lan party games I've ever played. Sure it's not the highest quality games but It's certainly one of the most fun esspecially with Friends.  I can't thank the Developers enough for all there hard work and sticking with their product until it became the game they always wanted it to be. Also Seriously the Game is only $1 now so if you havn't got it yet shame on you. It's the best value you'll ever get from one dollar. Can't Recomend enough. 
4895	1	a	This game will leave no jimmy unrustled
6000	1	a	Picked it up for $1.49, super great deal! The more I play the game, the more enjoyable it has gotten. There isn't a very large learning curve, and within the first hour or so you have a decent idea of what's going on. After that, exploring the levels some and seeing the different weapons and vehicles this game has to offer makes for an ejoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this game, there's a good chance it might suprise you!
1469	1	a	Shank 2 is a huge improvement on the underlying gameplay for the series. Whereas the original amounts to a pretty imitation of the oldschool brawler games, Shank 2 is better in all aspects (+new coop survival) and stands on its own as a worthy entry for this genre.   Dear Esther may be more artsy but this is the better game for the same amount of money. You wouldn't go wrong paying 15 for this even, in fact that's what they should've charged!
4997	1	a	Fun game, best one of the best Co-Op FPS game since Killing floor. Love the concept the maps are big and easy to navigate. Graphics are bad, some stuttering when switching guns and muddy texture. The reason I reccomend this game is it is CHEAP and easily playable with a group of friends. Would like to see the player count go up to 8 or 10 due to maps being very large.
1633	1	a	Enjoyable little platformer. If you're looking for a fun little game, this will be good for an hour or two :)
4306	0	a	Should've purchased goat simulator.
5888	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!    Too much to read?   Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   *this game in a nutshell  Community Created Artwork for ORION: Prelude By: Grayscars (original artwork uploaded by Grayscars!)
3527	1	a	This game is the reason Ebola struck back. Let me explain:  Ebola was having a nice day on Steam playing a bit of DayZ. He went onto the store page and there it was, for the 7th time that month - Orion: Prelude was on sale for dirt again. Ebola wept for humanity as he clicked the 'purchase' button and supplied Gabe with a 79p donut.   Ebola joined a game with his friend Aids and started playing this badly ported Xbox original indie game. Ebola said 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥' , went out of his mudhut and infected the West Africans.  The end.   INCASE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, THIS GAME SUCKS.
156	1	a	I'm enjoying this game a lot at the moment and it reminds me a lot of Dungeon Defenders. I purchased this and Orcs Must Die 2 in a Steam sale around a year ago I think and i definitely see myself replaying the game on Nightmare difficulty.  Your character is a funny war mage tasked with defending the various dungeons and bastions from an onslaught of ogres, kobolds and orcs. You get to control the war mage in third person as well as actively managing your traps.  Unlike some games you have to wait for a break or stoppage in waves to replace or build traps. In this game you can sell, and lay traps whilst the waves are happening (as long as you or an enemy aren't in the place you want to place your trap).  I felt like they could of expanded the story each level to give a sense of immersion, but the gameplay makes up for this flaw.  If you love tower defense games but want an alternative to your standard one then give this a try.  Pros:  - Fun Gameplay - Nice Assortment of Enemies - Quirky Main Protagonist - Plethora of Traps - Dynamic Trap Management - Cool Looking Artwork/Graphics  Cons:  - Not a very in-depth Storyline - Short Campaign - Graphics May not Appeal To Some - No Coop or Multiplayer Aspect.

3512	1	a	update for v3.0 This is my review of Orion Prelude I will not be comparing it to its past versions Orion Beatdown or Orion Dino horde, nor go into the devs back story. You want to know about THIS GAME not of its past. Orion Prelude is a first/third person shooter where its main game modes are to kill dinos to survive or to try and kill an opposite team.     There are a couple pvp modes but there aren't many people(you may find one or two servers) playing. The only pvp mode that gets love is Vital. This is a interesting Idea and is fun, but can have problems. Vital you have two teams of five each of you have a generator which you must protect from the dinos which only thing they do in life is kill you and your generator. As you kill you get credits you usually use them to upgrade yourself and get weapons but in Vital you can mess with your enemy's dino spawn. you can increase damage that dino deal, how many dinos spawn, and give them big dinos as a present and I feel its balance there. problems are with the players. It's doesn't have a balance system so instead it can be 4 old with 1 new vs 4 new and 1 old player its fun but you have to be careful . also this game mode will take you 1-3 hours(it may drag on) to beat and is really the greatest with a full team.    There are also three survival modes one named survival, conquest, and Slaughter. survival last around 40-50 mins in the most of the difficulties and your goal is to survival 10 rounds of dinos, how? by protecting your generator also you will have to go to outposts and capture them every 4ish rounds. You can buy weapons and upgrades in between rounds before the killing begins again.    Conquest is a copy and paste of survival but on a HUGE map, has 30 rounds, is 2-3 hours, and you can also buy jeeps, tanks, heles, and so on. It's fun but only use dedicated servers for if the host leaves then the game ends.    Slaughter is endless slaughter( I know what a surprise!) there are no rounds for you just keep getting hit by dinos you will be given guns and ammo over time and the longest I have survive is 20ish minutes and it's a good mode. in all, I play them at different times but each one is different and all are fun so I would suggest you try them all.   now that will give you a idea of the game itself I'm sure you have some other questions. (if I miss any please do not be afraid to ask for I will add it to the list, thank you.)  1. how does it run: it has always run well for me(60fps or higher) on ether of my pcs but I have heard that it runs better now than ever for some people who have had problems before.  2. sounds: Since 3.0 all weapon sounds have been redone/edited this has really made the games feel deadly. I have found one or two that I don't like but its an overall improvement.  3. graphics: Improved since 3.0, all maps look and feel better then they were and the new maps (2 which have been added in 3.0) are really well done.  4. how does it control?: good question, on mouse and keyboard like other good fps and controller  support is only for the 360pad, from what I hear its good there to.  5 modules: great don't have any problems with that. Although it's fun when the T-rex model flies in the air after killing it!  6. guns: you will see some guns that look semi normal but many are very cool and fun to just look at.   all in all its a great game. Its not a AAA title but you can sink some time in this. I would suggest this to poeple who loves first person and third person shooters. I feel you would have as much fun with yourself as you will online. also there is steam workshop to make maps so If you like making maps then you might want to get this to. (Note: workshop is stuck in beta mode until a bug can be fixed)  7. score: 9/10. v3.0 really has made this game shine its not prefect but its a great game.  p.s. If you have a question please ask.
4413	1	a	It's like Borderlands with dinosaurs.
3108	1	a	Flew some weird airplane into a T-Rex. Best $0.74 I've ever spent.
4949	1	a	Don't let the Metacritic review turn you away. This game is really good, and deserves another chance. Through months of vigorous patching and updating, this game is lots of fun to play. Really feels like Halo with dinosaurs plus mechs.
4040	1	a	This game is good for simulating human VS Dinosaur. The rampage mode allows you to be a dino and is fun. I highly reccomend the game
2789	1	a	I absoloutly love this game. 10/10    
1531	1	a	Under all the bland Indie shovelware that has plagued STEAM in the recent decade, this game stands out as a Diamond In The Rough.
5481	0	a	This is trash look at all the reviews no one can handle more than 10 hours of this crap on average i mean like really what did i expect from a $1 game all my friends said oh so good played 1 match they were saying how crap it was and cheaply made want a good game with dinosaurs get ARK survival evolved or something better atleast please don't fund the devs stupidity.
2507	0	a	When I first contemplated buying this game, I though: It's so cheap. It's like buying a can of coke, surely this will be more enjoyable. I was wrong, this buggy, spasmy game full of rubberbanding is not only more repetetive than a pendulum, but is actually less fun than watching one. The graphics suck, the game lacks animations, the sound is lofi. Even the announcer is laughably terrible.   There you have it. I should have gone with that can of coke.  3/10  Also, can you get refunds on steam?
2912	1	a	you get to fly around with jetpacks and shoot dinosaurs. what more could you want in a game? 11/10 would bang
2318	1	a	its like battlefield and borderlands 2 had a dino baby
5245	0	a	Being a dinosuar in this game is cancer... I couldnt even damage the enemy. Mega thumbs down from smeagol.
5114	0	a	The game itself has/had good promise. When I first saw it I thought 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs? Count me in!' But the game turned out to be decent fun, but with glaring issues. It is very poorly optimized. It was impossible to aim right to hit anything, and yet things still died. IDFK. The devs made promises (like fixing the technical issues, which is why I even played for more than 4 hours) which they either decided not to or never intended to keep, quickly turning this game (which has gone through 3 not very major iterations) into abandonware shortly after the prelude 'content' update. (It was really just a few logos, like train simulator 15/16/17/etc.) and then moving on to orion. Of course, I didnt realize any of this before putting down my cash for both games. (I'm a sucker for $0.49 deals). The second game is also crap, though i won't go into that here. Long story short, don't give these guys your money. Even for a $1.  TL;DR STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ITS DEVS.
6459	1	a	Played for an hour, got boring. If u like firing guns at dinosaurs get the game but I'm not into them so this game isnt for me. Cool game tho.
5204	0	a	Complete and utter trash. The guns are unbalnced, exploits every where, hackers,and servers with exp boost.
1820	1	a	Awesome game. My girlfriend and I played co-op. I controlled BEEP's movement, she controlled the grav/blaster gun. Very simple/easy mechanics up until the last part of the last level where you want to pull your hair out.  Get to last level. Stoked Get to last part of last level Difficulty spike Jump onto narrow platform that immediately starts dropping Panic Immediately attempt to jump to next platform Next platform is moving Die Repeat Get past where I was before Do series of precise jumps Die Overcome precision platforming See the end of the level Jump with reckless abandon Win  10/10 would fall in lava multiple times again
5981	1	a	5 Gabens/10  This game still looks a little rusty but it wont avoid making you a freaking addict to it.  Chased a T-Rex got surrounded by a swarm and died, would chase again.
3181	1	a	you know that moment when you pee after a long day of work and it feels so good and you're overwhelmed, that's just like this game except you're peeing out dinosaurs
3677	0	a	this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥, and i think i may have received cancer from playing this game. Please do NOT ever develope another game to save the human race as we know it.
2177	1	a	In short this game is almost free, gets updated all the time, has dinosaurs, a ton of modes/maps and is one of the most fun online FPS games on Steam.  And even if you don't like it, it's not like you're wasting a substantial amount of money or anything. Just skip lunch for a day and you'll be able to buy 2 or 3 4-packs of the game, you fattie. But I doubt you'll not enjoy it (I mean, you can kill raptors with a giant robot).  I've heard that a long time ago this game sucked and was full of glitches, but apparently they pretty much remade the whole game from scratch, so don't worry about it.  Oh, and you can play as a T.Rex. &lt;- this was the major selling point for me  Buy it.
167	1	a	Very addictive!
5040	1	a	i wish if u can be a dino it will be so awesome
4976	1	a	perfect game 10/10 easily best game ive played it has the fps feeling of call of duty but the strahtegy of chest. realist dinos its almost 3D horror action romance comdey all u can ask for packed into one game with famouse voice acter mr NOLAN NORTH!!!! vouce acts dinos and humans! at the same time! specialy desinged weapons for dinosores called dino guns you use ur dino hands to shhot people. grpahics like skyrim, action like mw2 and fun like league of legends get urs today and get urself a free dino gun in the mail.
1405	1	a	not too easy not too hard  has simple controls and very good gameplay
2339	1	a	I probably paid somewhere around $10 for this game when it was actively being worked on. It was one of the first early access games that I purchased and my friend and I had a blast killing dinosaurs. You used to be able to purchase vehicles as well as weapons. For whatever reason they took out the vehicle purchasing building. There are still vehicles, but they are spread out across the map in little outpost like areas. You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less. I would recommend this game, if you you have a friend that would like to blow away a bunch of dinosaurs with you. Well worth the $0.99.
2439	0	a	Whats orion mean?!
5988	1	a	This game is very fun when playing with a friend or more than one. Not that graphics matter, but when I turned all my graphics to low, everything still looked magnifique. REALLY FUN GAME TO PLAYYYYYYYYYYYY~
109	1	a	The Game is awesome. A Mix of Magic &amp; Poker with a touch of Fantasy.
3221	1	a	Orion: Prelude (Or Dino Horde, when I had this game) is a game where, you guessed it, kill dinosaurs. But it doesn't just stick to slaying gigantic creatures. You also get to pick from a hefty variety of gamemodes that change the pace of the game, sometimes entirely!  Would I recommend someone to play this game? It's $0.99. How can you NOT buy it?
1816	0	a	  Ok, so here we go. I got this game from a raffle so I guess I shouldn't be complaining, but the 'Yoshi's Island + Half-Life Gravity Gun' is a prettty much a lie, at least on the Gravity Gun part. The so called 'Gravity Gun' works more like Garry's Mod's Physigun, using a beam to pick up and throw things and the only way you can launch ojects being pushing or 'throwing' the object at enemies. The game also isn't customizable, so you have to use the layout it gives you. The screen size was automatically set to fullscreen and the resolution stuck in one position, rendering me unable to see anything but one quarter of the screen. The gameplay itself is ok, a lot of the time the help bubbles couldn't really be understood though with spelling and grammar errors. The music is pretty good though, the physics are neat, and the art style nice, but unless you are super duper bored, don't buy this game. It makes good raffle, gift, or trade filler though. I think this game could be better with achievements to give reason to collect all the anti-matter and beat every level.
278	1	a	Wow this game is addicting! Part shooter, part tower defense, this game is AMAZING! Not to mention hilarious! The point of the game is to defend Rifts, and to do this you must place traps on the floors, use magic, and your trusty crossbow. But the funny part comes with the way you can defeat the opposing Orcs. One way is to place Spring Boards on the floor that launch the orcs whereever you aim the board. This can result in humorous and deadly outcomes. Another example is the dialogue, just plain goofy! Plus....drum roll please....ACHIEVEMENTS!!! Yup another game with achievements to keep the gamer coming back for more slightly-stoopid bragging rights! Pick this game up! Its unique, funny, fun, and OMG FUN!!!
3225	1	a	Alright. A lot of things to say about this lovely game! It is so fun and awesome with co-op and friends! Playing this also works on really crappy laptops and desktops and you won't have overheating problems! Its kind of like a halo weapons with destiny costumes and the vehicles are too fun! Even playing with bots is crazy fun! $0.99 this dollar can be found on the floor. Hell people find 10 dollars on the floor! Get this now! Like seriously, bro! What you waiting for?
1730	1	a	10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN   LIFE SIMULATOR 101  FRIEND BOUGHT IT FOR ME AND STOPPED ME FROM CUTTING  WOW MUCH GAME VERY MATURE  A TON OF BLOOD AND GORE BUT THAT'S GOOD.
5326	1	a	i got it when it was .99 cents and it was worth it, but im not sure about it going f2p
355	1	a	its dungeon defenders but it doesnt make you want to kill yourself when you play it
3787	0	a	Hard on any pc even with graphics on the lowest setting... Take care when playing.
2211	1	a	its kind of good
3905	0	a	
5183	0	a	Less fun than drowning.
2649	1	a	10/10
3119	1	a	Reminds me of Firefall ... but a little bit cheaper
532	1	a	Awsome game, puts dungeon defenders to shame even without the multiplayer.
816	1	a	buy game very good plz
6303	1	a	Good game on Unreal engine for only 0,79EU. Kill dino horde make money buy weapons, perks and upgrade your gear and kill again. I recomend buy 4-pack of game so you can gift it to your friends and howe more fun as team :)  PS Still have some network issues, but come on name one multiplayer game who does not have it :)
4724	0	a	I hate it
3500	1	a	Let's be honest - this game is seriously outdated. But you can still have some fun if you find any friends willing to join you, cause multiplayer is almost dead. I bought it for 13 russian roubles (which is $0.25 now) so it's the cheapest non-free-to-play game ever. Dirt cheap.
728	1	a	Awesome FPS/TD game. Like Dungeon Defenders, but less monotonous (but also only one-player)
2870	1	a	Purchased the game watching the videos. It looked like alot of fun. But then a saw that it had such a low metascore... i then thought dumb for buying a game that has a low metascore.. i shook it off and started the game. I loved it!! its alot of fun with friends. by yourself it can get hard. I recommend this game only if you have friends to play it with! 8/10
3738	0	a	this game is total dogshit. don't buy it. the developers are scammy as hell and tried to do some shady â¥â¥â¥â¥ to hide from their terrible reviews. Don't buy it.
137	1	a	Good meat!
6053	1	a	When I saw the graphics in the game, it took me back to the year 2002. Ah yes the early days of the PS2. The summer of 2002 was a great summer. I was a young lad of 13 years old. I wore Hawaiian shirts every day and drank Sprite Ice as I rode my mountain bike my parents got me for my 12th birthday. I would visit my friends who skateboarded. I would try and jump the skateboard ramp on my mountainbike and crashed horribly. I ripped one of my Hawaiian shirts doing this. Boy, was my mom sore with me. Those were the last days of my innocence. After these precious moments, I grew up more and more each year. My mountain bike eventually passed down to my brother, as did my Hawaiian shirts. Summer became autumn. Autumn became winter. And so on. The ps2 got better graphically. Then the ps3 came out. Then the ps4. Most of my skateboarder friends are dead now. Sprite doesn't make Sprite Ice anymore. Thank you, ORION: Dino Horde. 10/10.
5886	1	a	good game dino killing fun with head blasting hilarousnes trex and pterdactyle probobly the harder ones but thats whats good it adds variety and challenge thats whats good but its got its bads like a glitch where i hit a rock flying my jetpack i got downed and i fell into there and for about a minute i was coming back down and i already before i hit the grownd but thats me its really good try it
1722	0	a	BEEP is just not vey interesting and feels very much like a flash game. I didn't find it too bad at first considering the 19 cents I paid, but after an hour or so I was already bored. The gravity gun is not very fun to use and a lot of the game seems to be just stacking stuff so that you can get up. I wouldn't compare it to Yoshi's Island at all.  The most annoyng thing about this game is the very robot you play as. It babbles and screeches in a high, annoying voice, and you get to hear gems like 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' over and over again when you shoot enemies. But unlike some reviews claim you can disable the sounds and music.
2459	1	a	The Best Way to play this game, Is to play with freinds.
1239	1	a	fun tower defence game
1318	1	a	Amazing game. Fluid controls, visceral combat. and best of all, great couch co-op!
3849	0	a	Remember Dino Crisis 3? Play that instead. This game is poop.
6183	1	a	this game costs less than a candy bar. buy it and shoot a triceratops right in the face
1548	1	a	Terrible, terrible console port. I tried my very best raising the FPS above 20, without any success. Don't buy this one for PC. Even if it's on sale.  Edit: Now that I've got a much more powerful PC it seems to work alright, with the exception of the framerate being capped when first installed. There's a handy reference to unlock it over on the PCGaming Wiki:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Warp  It's an alright, quirky little game and quite fun. The port still stands out as terrible though, so beware before buying it.

4613	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
2381	1	a	This game is so awesome now, shooting dinosaurs for only 99 cents! I bought 4 copies of this game for 1.50 euros to give to my friends and play together. This game is very fun and challenging for a couple of hours. ORION: Prelude is totally worth your money: 8/10
2022	1	a	5/5 Better than bad rats
4269	1	a	Bad game. Don't play. Play Halo instead.
4785	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. The first thing you see in the game is the main menu. Everything normal right? Well it isn't. As soon as I launched it and saw the main menu I witnessed my graphics card's temperature ramp up from 40Âº to 75ÂºCelsius. I changed my graphics settings to the minimum possible and I saw no difference. My framerate was still locked to 60 and my GPU was still running hot.  That's just one issue: Optimization. Let's get to the next part: Gameplay I haven't tested any gamemodes other than survival so I can't really vote on this one but I got bored almost immediately, using every class and playing in different ways. The weapon system is lacking and sure needs work.  Just don't buy this. Even for 70 cents it's not playable. Don't kill your gpu for a 70cents game.
3193	1	a	RAWWWRR pew pew pew RAWWWRR pew pew BANG! game summed up
3620	1	a	For a game that you can buy for less than a dollar, this is the best you could ever hope for.  Yes there are some bugs and it doesn't exactly feel like a complete game, but shooting dinosaurs while flying on a jetpack just feels fun. I highly recommend this.
2190	1	a	BEST GAYM EVER JHHRURHURADKAD :melon:
2653	1	a	I have no idea how it costs so little. It shouldn't be this good.
136	1	a	  5 out of 5
4749	1	a	Spend a little bit of time this holiday season playing this... festive spirit 
5398	0	a	i bought it 0.49$ so worth it for me LOL Uhhhh... this game need to devolope much things sort of AI and game play
3799	0	a	If this game was paying you to play it then maybe it would have been worth the install.  This game feels worse than some of the 'Starseige: Tribes' mods I played more than 10 years ago.  The character animations are very clunky, most of the UI looks like it was made by a 14 year old in paint.  Weapons have no semblance of balance, the knife is the most powerful weapon in the game by miles.
5338	0	a	This garbage is worse than garbage.
3662	1	a	This game is so much fun, when you make fun of how bad it is with your friends.
4175	1	a	Wow. Just wow. before i was saying this game is bad because it was having a lot of bugs and glitches. Now with the new update its the best game EU and the cheapest game and awesome i really do recommend this game.  Gameplay 8/10 A.I 9/10 Graphics 7.5/10 Soundtrack 8/10 Multiplayer 5/10 (Because it does not show a lot of players and servers)
4001	0	a	Since it got free to play for a few days I decided to give it a go. I'm not a real fan of shooter games but if they're interesting I play them. From the videos I thought I should give it a go.   After installing the game started and I was scurrying trough the options (I always do). Out of the blue I got my first achievement, yay! Anyways, after that I decide to 'Play Game' apparently you first have to FIND a game so I did that. However the room list doesn't update and it takes forever if you make one by yourself (because it doesn't update for anyone)...   So I went solo. I don't like solo. But hey I tried! Apparently the goal is to steal eggs and drop them off somewhere, while you keep shooting like a madman on the dinos. However the game wasn't very smooth for me so aiming was not an option, and you can't shoot while carrying eggs. I tried many, many times to do this game and when I finally put down the T-Rex, IT RESPAWNED. Yay! So you can't even really finish this game anyways because you get â¥â¥â¥-raped the whole time -.-  Sorry to say but, personally I absolutely hated it.
4208	0	a	MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ARE A JOKE  I am at least double the requirements of this game and cannot play at anything but 1fps on the lowest settings!! Fix this game and I will change my review 
6120	1	a	a game you can't stop playing hrs upon hrs of fun :D
1868	1	a	I only play with the level selection screen. 69 outta 10!
2814	1	a	For $1 I could have done a lot worse. This game is a lot of fun for the price. Yes there are annoying glitches and sometimes crazy lag, I have very muc enjoyed my time playing this game and will log in a lot more hours. Way to make a fun game guys :D
4921	1	a	this game is awesome enough said
5062	1	a	AWESOME GAME!! It is one of the best games i have ever played, and for you who is thinking about getting it do so.
5507	1	a	bset game ever, and this should cost 60 euros! and more! Great graphices nice gameplay best game I played
2321	1	a	Noscoping dinosours has never been so fun.
577	1	a	You know, the condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip it on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, then you throw it away. The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
1273	1	a	Great top-down shooter....cool graphics....xbox 360 controller works great also...best of all it is 9.99....8/10
869	1	a	Stop hesitating and start building .
3513	0	a	Don't waste your time on this one.
3704	0	a	This sucks dino balls! Literally!! But it was only 99 cents.
5055	1	a	i bought this game in 2012 when it first came out and ive loved it ever since. its a great game to play with freinds
1977	1	a	I'm sure a lot of people look at this game and immediately move past it because of the graphics. This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ thing to do for reasons I should think are obvious. The game starts off with a couple short levels for adjusting to the controls and once that's done the game becomes fantastic.  Solid soundtrack, fun and simple physics mechanics which are easy to pick up and hard to master (the best thing for anything to be really), good pacing in terms of new things being introduced to the player. It's a quick little game that doesn't waste a lot of time but just all around feels good to play and has a lot of charm. Whatever, if you like platformers then grab it
1384	1	a	Awesome game, i enjoyed the first one very much, so it was a no brainer to get this one. Visually it looks better, the art style is still the same as the first but more refined. The single player campaign is cool, but not very long. In my opinion the single player was just enough, because the Survival mode co-op is tonnes of fun.   Highly recommended and if you get it during a steam sale then its a win, win.   Make Shank 3!  10/10
5564	0	a	I don't even own this game lmao
3615	1	a	Love this game, basically The most fun i have had playing a firstperson shooter against players that arent the same as you, 'dino VS Human' you really need to get this game :)
6156	1	a	Stupid fun. I mean that literally. A weekend dollar well spent. Get your friends, kill some dinos, use a jetpack, laugh.
3572	1	a	Kinda like Primal Carnage, but different. Really difficult with out a team, but add in some friends and its really fun.
3781	0	a	It's really bad... its confusing, ugly, pointless and crashes all the time
5897	1	a	Perfect game for $.99, Lots of fun with friends.
5649	0	a	Changes name of game repeatedly to hide negative reviews. Steals assets. Fires dev team before game release. Nice.   Maybe he'll rename the game again to hide all these negative reviews too.
2359	1	a	Like killing Dinousaurs? Want a first person shooter? Do you want to drive tanks, fly helicopters and control mechas? Or what if you want to be the Dinousaur and kill the other players? Now imagine you can do all this in one game. Welcome to ORION: Prelude :P
3857	1	a	As of right now, the game isn't highly polished. Nut it works, and that's what matters. Fun game, low price.
5050	0	a	Don't buy this, no one plays
3219	1	a	its a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ but i love it
808	1	a	A solid orc-killing tower-defending good time. Funny, sharp, and fun. Not really too long though. 4/5
3720	0	a	It's horrible! The game play is bad, the graphics suck and overall it is horrible quality. Why did I even bother spending money on this garbage.
4432	0	a	What about people who play when it's not F2P ?? no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing refund for this ?? i feel disapointment so much :&lt;
1845	1	a	You can actually throw enemies to your enemies.
3196	1	a	&gt;Bought it during the steam christmas sale for %51 off. &gt;Lauched it up but never played a round &gt;Never even launched the game for about 5 months &gt;Finaly got back on the game and played 1 solo game &gt;Only got past wave 2 &gt;Didn't play the game for about another 3-4 months &gt;Got back on a couple days ago and played a hour or two &gt;Found out the game was pretty good, like halo but you kill dinosaurs instead.  10/10 would spend 49 cents and not play it for 5 months again
129	1	a	I hate orcs and this is good for my soul
374	0	a	Original, Fast Paced and Damn Addictive.  All 3 describe this game to maximum precision. It is such a fun game, hours can be eaten away form your hands playing through the extensive single player campaign. It does lack the single most important thing that would make this game more fun.   Multiplayer.  Seriously, without it, this game is bland, you want to experience the Orc mayhem with your buddies. Skip this one, go for the sequel.  WompWompWommmmmp/10
4021	1	a	Sold my AK-47 and m4a1-s on Cs go then purchased this game for 0.99$ Totally worth it.
6330	1	a	Absolute T-Rex of a game, with dashings of pterodactyls
767	1	a	Damn, this is some great tower defence meets FPS meets rivers of orc blood.
4778	0	a	its ok, crashs more than I would like and a lot of server drops.
1854	1	a	I wish beep can kill and throw my ex around like he does with his enemies
2850	1	a	Ignore the metascore review, its wrong. This game is stupidly fun and you find yourself playing it over and over again with friends. This game is simply fun, if you're looking deeper into this gane welp, then you're not even trying to have fun. It's simple, it's fun and enjoyable and a good game overall. It's like 10 bucks too, just buy it.
5508	0	a	It is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ F2P P2W game, except you pay money upfront. The gameplay is okay, but the lowest graphics settings can still be laggy on weaker machines. 2/10
1124	1	a	Pretty Bad â¥â¥â¥
1437	1	a	Try out this bad boy while waiting for an update on your favorite game.  It has it all and only for 9.99.
2403	1	a	Started off as really biggy and unplayable but has been pbeen getting better and better and is now qite fun to playh, Highly recommended.
2324	1	a	It's Halo. BUT WITH FRICKING DINOS. nuff said
4509	0	a	It's endless rounds of the same objectives over and over, there is no winning this game. You instead keep fighting hordes of dinosaurs until you die, then you can try to do better again I guess. It has ZERO plot, dinosaurs and unnamed futuristic Soldiers. This game must have taken the designers all of three minutes to come up with. I was hoping fr something like Turok and was very disappointed.
1488	1	a	Very easy game (except a few locations), almost without any storyline, but I've great time with it, it's nice, cute and funny. I don't often play games more than once but in this case I will.
4051	1	a	play this game if you bored with survive from zombies
2119	1	a	Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.  Longer review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.  Nothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.  My only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.  You'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.  Similarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.  Pros:
3627	1	a	Chum is fum
4967	1	a	Very fun to play with friends you will have lots of laughs but playing alone can be sort of dull.
1894	1	a	This is a fun little game to play for a few minutes here and there. Very simple to control.  The price helps too, so cheap. Trading cards are an added bonus.
2902	1	a	I've had this game for a while and I don't see how it got better... At all... I read reviews that hype it up and saying it got better since it changed its name to Prelude, and I see no change... I only recommend this game because I do still like it, I liked it before and like it now, but I was expecting that it did get better lol.
2860	1	a	Given the massive sale that is going on right now it warrants a look at only $1. The score given by Metacritic is wrong. The game is a polished FPS that is continually getting updated. Fast paced survival action is what gets it for me. Nothing seems to over powered or useless, and there are many different styles to choose from, and routs to take. I am looking forward to see where they take this game in the future and I am gad I can be along for the ride.
1345	1	a	Great Platformer and time-shoter :D
2325	1	a	It's 0.79p?  what you waiting for i got more enjoyment out of this than COD AW   no surprises though :(  but this game for 79p   go.
4108	1	a	Bearing in mind the price of this game, it's pretty okay!!
6213	0	a	Frankly, I say don't waste your money. This game has dinosaurs and shooting thats it. It gets repetitive and boring fast. The only enjoyment you can get from this is laughing at how bad it is.
3423	1	a	it's like halo but with dinosaurs 10/10
6398	1	a	Okay.. within my first match I rammed both a T-Rex and a Stego with a 4-Wheeler while a teammate was shooting at them with a tank. After which I went back for supplies and found a mech so proceeded to shoot the crap out of raptors with it while firing homing charges.   What about that doesn't sound like a good time?
441	1	a	Orcs Must Die's formula is simple, but what little it does it does very, very well and is a riot to play. The traps are a ton of fun to use and trap deaths look fantastic and satisfying. The later additions of simplistic spell trees and spells round the game up nicely and killing orcs was never this much fun xD. If you get into the competitive nature of the game you'll find out how surprisingly deep it is as customizing your character and traps and selecting the 'right' ones can greatly impact your final stage score and the speed at which you move and place your traps can mean all the difference.  8.5/10
5409	1	a	Really fun game specially with friends. Not the most extreme epic graphics and textures but the game is still very much fun all around. A must have as part of a LAN party pack.
3401	1	a	the graphics look like Halo CE. Other than that great job :melon:
2787	1	a	It's essentially killing floor, but cheaper and with dinosaurs and a car...and jetpacks...and no patriarch. It's actually nothing like killing floor. 8/10 Would recommend to people who like Killing Floor.
4345	1	a	You can go Chuck Norrirs on a T-rex from inside a combat walker a.k.a. mech. How awesome is that?
942	1	a	The game can easily be summed up by its title. Orcs Must Die is about making a large amount of orcs into a large amount of dead orcs (and orc pieces). Of course, there's more to it than simply 'Use crossbow on orc' as there are a number of fiendish traps, magic, and AI guardians that you can employ, making it something akin to a tower-defence game. There's more focus on action, though, as you're encouraged to jump in and do your part in causing a bit of death and dismemberment of your own. On top of it all is a somewhat basic story, though there is so much character and humor packed in that it still seems fresh and entertaining. To call the game 'mindless fun' would be a little misleading as there is some strategy involved in trap placement and personal upgrades, but the real fun lies in watching a group of clueless orcs wandering towards a corridor full of all manner of blades and spikes and being reduced to 'orc salsa' while you giggle softly to yourself.
2934	0	a	10/10 would not play even if it had a naked super model at the end
1004	1	a	Great game, lots of fun while killing monsters :)
3682	1	a	Very good game and a lot of fun for not much money :) recommend for everyone that want to grind some prehistoric animals.
3898	1	a	Got this game for $0.99 on sale, I would have paid more. This game defiantly deserves another chance, I just played almost 2 hours of it in a row after buying it up and will defiantly be playing more with my friends. It is one of those games that is just much better with friends, so i highly recommend finding friends to play it with.   This game deserves an 8.5/10, and i heard they are still planning even more updates in the future. I would consider it a game that is in Beta stage, but at least they finally got it out of that horrible Alpha stage.  I can see it turning into something amazing once they have finished.
5445	0	a	I do like that this game is in the regard that it is updated often and it displays that the developers care for the game and want to promote the game as they update it. Though, I was still disappointed with the game even with the being updated so often. The game play is like many shooters but with sub par controls and broken game play. With the teamwork being the most important in the game but even with skilled human players, they dinosaurs have the advantage most of the time. Maybe in the future this game will be satisfying.
4438	0	a	Awful graphics and awful game play. no wonder it's being flogged for 99p this weekend.
621	1	a	very fun if you are fun of games like ballon tower defence and all that 
5321	0	a	It worked extremely slowly on my old computer and no servers were up. Keep in mind, this was some time ago. I do not understand why I must re-buy this game to play it now.
3024	1	a	Pretty good game Pros Weapons Difficulties Gamemodes Dinos Cons Bad graphics  8.3/10
3570	1	a	Just simply amazing!
5474	0	a	ORION: Dino Prelude Beatdown Horde is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. And anyone who willingly spends money in this virus of a games microtransaction store needs to be sent to a Mental Institute and evaluated. Even though its priced less than a dollar, don't buy it, its a trap, what seems like a dumb joke becomes an immediate regret. Run, while you still can, and avoid this game at ALL costs.
3726	0	a	Don't buy this. save your 0.99p on the sale!
540	1	a	So first off, got this game during a Steam Sale for cheap, didn't think I would like it. Boy was I wrong! Finished the first game in a good amount of time, got addicted, bought the second one NOT on sale, finished that one too. Excellent game mechanics, gameplay is smooth on my rig, and I really enjoyed the humour and storyline. All in all 10/10
5856	1	a	How did i manage to review this game? I don't own it.
2752	1	a	THE DINOSWER CAME UP TO ME THEN I PEW PEW IT WITH BO THAT COST A MILLION COINS THE I DIE   GOOD GAME OVERAL
4473	1	a	0/10 They're changing it.
3330	1	a	Spiral Games Studioâs newest game set in the Orion universe is Orion: Dino Horde. A supersession of Spirals previous game Orion: Dino Beatdown, Dino Horde expands the game mechanics and universe in every direction into something worthy of having James Cameron or Ridley Scott putting their names on. The cinematic visuals and lighting are some of the best Iâve ever seen in a game, and are something to be expected from a Spielberg film.   Check out my full review at     indieNewsNow.com   [indienewsnow.com] 
338	1	a	A great Tower Defence + FPS, must have!
2568	1	a	Burned three hours in one sitting since buying this game. For the dollar I payed for it I've already gotten a 33 cent per hour return on it. Keep in mind this is only fun with friends.
526	1	a	A simple game with loads of fun and a whacky style. The title says it all ;-)
4056	0	a	...
670	1	a	The best game where you play a Bruce Campbellian jockhead wizard hero and fight orcs in a 3rd person shooter tower defense game.
438	1	a	Another hidden gem on Steam, bought for less than Â£3 it is terrific value for money. An interesting twist on the tower defence games (a firm favourite of mine) it sees you stopping orcs using an elabarate range of traps and defences. A great buy at a great price.
5331	1	a	Fun with friends, it's hilarious, stupid, amazing, fun, bullcrap, and definitely worth the price.
4308	0	a	this game sucks its sooooooo laggy they did not make this better than the last one it  suuucks
23	1	a	Runespell is a combination of RPG, Solitaire and Poker, similar in nature to Puzzle Quest. You stack cards like in solitaire to form 5 card poker combos to attack your foes and cast spells. It's fairly simple to play an so is the presentation. The story is based on Norse Mythology and while it's somewhat thin it does has its twists and turns. I found the gameplay enjoyable for the most part and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Unfortunately, as the Overture in the title says it feels like a first part of something bigger, a second game that may never come out. That didn't upset me but can frustrate some people who got more invested in the story.
3523	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
2767	1	a	It's not bad, but it's also not good. If you enjoy a buggy dino slaughter, buy this game 
4483	1	a	Fun game, but suffers from some frame rate issues, and lag when you are not the host, regardless of host's internet connection.
5576	0	a	All positive recension? OMG seriously? worst game i have ever played is really much filthy.
5477	1	a	If this game was a fork it would be a great fork   10/10 would use it again
5811	1	a	Good for 50 cents.
6250	0	a	WHY THROW ALL THE GOOD STUFF OF DINO HORDE AWAY :(, now listen i know what your thinking, this game looks good but listen NO, there are graphical bugs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ LOADS, hey its worth 1 dollar but i hope this stays permanately until they fix the bugs. Oh did i also mention the menu has xbox controller button prompts, that spice up the review a bit?
3184	1	a	Its relly good and fun game but little laggy and buggy also pay2win i think   Ill givethis game 8/10 :P  Comon buy it its cost onley 1$
3810	1	a	Fun game! was well worth the $1.49 I would really love to see some south african servers though
4154	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced. The dinosaurs were photorealistic, but I guess you would expect that from a top quality studio like ummm... whoever makes this bloody game. 10/10 very good. btw i love the jurassic park movies if anyone has a spare copy of jurassic park 1 id be happy and id probably blow you. Lots of love Adolf Linkin.
433	1	a	One of the funnest Tower Defense games to be had outside of WC3 / SC2 mods.
876	1	a	If you hate orcs, this is the game for you
3209	1	a	This game is excellent, ignore that low meta score because it is so much fun to play, single-player or mulitplayer but is best with others, the graphics are good and the mechanics great. I have found no bugs so it is very smooth to play and easy to learn. It can get very heart-thumping at times and is very good fun for groups of friends
5275	1	a	UPDATE: SO the devs have been constantly updating the game , After years of release , There are virtually no BUGS , and content is added on a regular basis!   The game is very enjoyable fast paced and good for having a great time with friends or your girl friend .   DO NOT listen to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥uckers from call of duty negging this game , they are mindless idiots with less than 0.1 hours in this game and just 1 line reviews , it shows their worth and class and that they are clearly negging the game because their daddy company activision was involved with an issue with orion devs  Regarding that issue , Anyone who has half a brain would know working with online contractors often results in palgarism , its not the teams fault , upon notification they pulled out the content that was offensive to activision , Hell activision bullied them before even notifying them  So all in all what did i learn ? THIS IS A GREAT GAME , but most gamers are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that like sucking â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of big corporations that charge them 60$ each year instead of honest developers that provide free updates years after realease .   This is the reality , buy and judge for your self. ---------------- old review   SPAWNED WITH MY GF  DINO EATS MY GF   10/10 WOULD PLAY GET RID OF MY GF SIMULATOR AGAIN

1410	1	a	Great beat-em-up platformer. Put on the Pendulum In Silico album in the background and it's perfect.
4806	1	a	A very under-rated game that with a few friends is a VERY enjoyable experience
6110	1	a	Buy this game it has everything every man needs like guns .....and dinosaurs....and cars with mounted guns..and well everything just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it already...
972	1	a	Hate Orcs? and want to kill them with traps and spells...then this game is for you!
517	1	a	No orcs were hurt in the making of this game - oh, wait...
5017	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
3206	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a sword. The dinosaurs didn't have feathers. NOT SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL!
677	1	a	Who doesnt love killin' orcs? This game is amazing! i really recommend this to all people who like fighting in generally  You will love this game  
2903	1	a	Seriously this game is pretty badass. Think Killing Floor but with Dinosaurs. I always wondered what life would be like if I could beat down some velocoraptors with a laser sword and now I now.
4511	0	a	Doesn't work. Thumb down.  Pc specs:  Asus 8GB ram. Intel core i7.  The game doesn't even work on low settings... 
3535	1	a	when i had this game for two day trail i was like AWESOME (when is this going to be another two day trail)
4938	1	a	great game love it good gun good game play maps and cars so i can give it a 10/10
2879	1	a	What BF3-4 Dinosaurs should be!
488	1	a	The nearly simultaneous release of this game and Dungeon Defenders has led to inevitable comparisons between the two games, and rightly so. Both games are Tower Defense games played on a personal level rather than a top down perspective. Both have the player control a character that can run the course of maps, place a number of defenses and traps, use different abilities and go toe to toe with the advancing mobs with melee and ranged weapons. The difference comes in the approach. Dungeon Defenders distributes the different abilities among different classes making the game virtually unplayable in single player especially if youâre playing a support class. Orcs Must Die has no multiplayer but gives all the abilities to one character with new abilities with each successful mission. Orcs Must Die also feels much more action oriented. If youâre looking for a good tower defense game that you can play by yourself, look no further than this game!
2088	1	a	Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space with rocket launchers, lazers, and a sword? Do you want to do all that for only a dollar?  Of course you do! Buy this game!
6284	1	a	it was alright. i'll say they should change the hud a bit but it was nice
4408	0	a	bought this game as a joke after betting with my friend whether this game is worth a $ . played this game only for cards and later deleted this game . 10/10 would rate meh8/h8
1066	1	a	This game is AWESOME. Extremely well-polished singleplayer experience full of humor and fun.  The art, the audio, the gameplay, it's all quite solid and well-executed. The maps are significantly varied in layout (though not so much in art style) and all leave room for different strategies and play styles. The game really starts to open up as you unlock more abilities as you progress through the campaign.  I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy singleplayer, action games, and/or tower defense games. There are some pretty crazy sales for it, but honestly I would still feel like I've gotten my money's worth at full price.  The DLC is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, but maybe hold off if it's full price and you haven't fallen in love with the game yet.
3356	1	a	I play this game when my thirst for life goes dangerously high
3902	1	a	This is the only game ive ever played that let me run at a horde of dinosaurs with knife while wearing a dinosaur mask. 10/10
2801	1	a	Pretty good game if you happened to get in on the huge sale, other than that i couldn't rec @ 15$. Controls are below average, weapons are about average, gameplay is maybe a little below average, graphics are poor, concept is pretty badass!
3063	1	a	Got gangbanged by chickens, 10/10
4574	1	a	Pretty fun for it's price. It's not a game that I could see my self playing for days on end but overall it's pretty good.   Cons: Graphics could use some improvment
1156	1	a	This game's a cult hit, and it deserves to be. Vibrant graphics (though you're indoors all the time), great humor, great gameplay (exactly what you expect) and enough of a challenge for anyone.
4715	1	a	Paid Â£5 for a free game 5/7
5708	0	a	'Fake &amp; Gay' =3 troll 
4340	1	a	I remember when it was dino: beatdown and it was 15 dollars... So â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6276	1	a	No dinosaur boob physics....0/10 IGN Approved
1766	1	a	mighty beep
1543	1	a	Just buy it !!!
5600	1	a	I just got this game and I like it ALOT.   The main goal is to keep your generator on as long as possable. I WOULD RECOMEND Pros:  Easy to learn Can play with friends Basic yet hard Cheap but worth it  Cons:  Low Graghics The Dinos that fly are to hard to kill for the lower levels It will lag when turning to fast. The Dinos movment is not realistic  
5588	0	a	This game sucks, I got it when it was paid for. It justs throws you into a server without showing you how to do anything. Don't waste you time, play a better game like anything else than this.
873	1	a	Entertainingly Epic
3519	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'
2202	1	a	It's pretty much Halo: Reach but you're killing dinosaurs instead of screaming children.
3182	1	a	Thank god they changed it from a expensive grabage to a cheap masterpiece.
6393	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ was 0.99 cent
879	1	a	Tower defense with strategy. Rather, it's strategy using tower defense. The 'towers' aren't so much towers as they are traps. Oil traps, impaling traps, arrow traps, launcher traps, and so on. Set them up at the right spots, and watch the orcs go flying back the way they came, or dying on the spot.  Oh, and don't forget to listen to what they say while you're killing them, or what your character says while he's killing them. That's always amusing.
260	1	a	I had to stop because I had to click too much and it was annoying Chris on skype.
1332	1	a	Very short and mediocre side-scrolling brawler. Well put together with no particularly good or bad elements. Nice graphics though. There isn't really much more to say about this one. Would play if nothing better.
5645	0	a	Shooting dinosaurs in space? What could go wrong? Everything.
4885	0	a	Controls are bad, visuals are bad, options menu does not save changes.
6042	1	a	Punching Dinosaurs. That is all.
352	1	a	Best 'Tower Defence' game what I have played sofar!
1597	1	a	Buy this, if you don't like it throw it away &amp; buy another one because you do like it.
1324	1	a	If you have played the first one, there is no need to recommend this one. But if you haven't play the first one - play it! And then you'll come for more here!
4639	1	a	very aweseom game buy buy
5257	1	a	worth the 99 cents 
149	1	a	I got this game for .99 cents when it was on sale, I thought it wouldn\'t be much fun but the opposite is true. This game is a surprising rendition of a classic TD but has a very unique element to it, You are the Character setting traps and slaying orcs with a crossbow. This game with all its unique trap combos, my favorite the Floor Burner with a spring trap to make them endlessly run through it again and again, makes the gameplay enjoyable, there are a few annoying maps but all in all a great game   Lets take a minute to go through the pros and cons  Pros- The game is surprisingly addictive slaughtering orcs over and over with a trap combo  The game has unique traps and different map levels each time so you don\'t get used to the same strategy  The headshot feature is my personal favorite   Archers on a bridge are OP  The Graphics are suprisingly great   Cons- The music for the orcs is a bit redundant but fun  I wish OGRES weren\'t so OP as well as the Fliers if you get caught offguard   Overview- I would recommend this game for someone who likes TD\'s and Strategy   PS. Or slaughtering orcs :D
2286	1	a	this game is sp00ky, 10/10 would bang
282	1	a	Nice game, I want to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
360	1	a	I Love the game
3725	0	a	Game described in 2 words: Connection lost...
4780	1	a	10/10 would play for never 
3404	1	a	ARIZONA Vs. ORION: Prelude  I played this game for a total of 33 minutes, this includes the time I spent trying to find a server to play on. The game is worth $0.99 with no sale. Do you know what else is worth $0.99? A can of Arizona ice tea. I caculated the time I would spend to consume the beverage. ORION: Prelude gave me more time of enjoyment than an Arizona ice tea for the same price.   PLEASE READ: I didn't caculate the amount of enjoyment that one may find playing with the aluminum can after the liquid is consumed. Activities like squishing it aganist your head, stomping on it, cutting it open than poking your friends with the sharp edge and playing the game where you flick the can opener to see if you can flick it off. All these activities are equally, if not, more fun than ORION: Prelude, ORION: Dino Horde, Dino Beatdown etc.  
6134	0	a	Game play was glitchy at best
538	1	a	before I was a lad i killed the orkish folk.
6063	1	a	this game is halo and jurrassic park. there are perks to buy with credits just like in CoD zombies which can be used different ways to fit whatever play style you want. got a 36 on meta score but is way more fun than that rating...
4560	1	a	For 99p you really need to be scummy to give this a bad review. (I'm surprised halo hasn't sued)
3342	0	a	DO not play this game. It's not worth the bandwidth to download. Uninventive, ugly as hell, stiff, 99cents would still be a rip off
6077	1	a	So bad that it is amazing
3803	0	a	Shoot dinosaurs, get bored. Ai is terrible, some graphics belong back in doom or quake and the gameplay is bland. There is a ton of content but it all feels empty.
73	1	a	See the hours I've played? Yup, finished, done, a few achievements if I really cared, but I don't. So was it worth the price of entry? Yeah I guess. At it's heart it's a pretty simple game with an interesting and simple battle mechanic. The developers do a good job of dressing it up and making it feel like there's more to it, but there's only so much that can be done to make what's really more of a browser or mobile game seem more substantial. The games saving grace and why I give it a tentative recommendation is the battle system. Over all it's not bad, not bad at all. But once you figure out the optimal strategies it becomes a matter of making sure you've grinded enough to charge your 'spell' cards and your pretty much golden. With a multi-player option this would be a total recommendation, as it is buy if the battle mechanic interests you, if not give it a pass.
174	1	a	â Good graphics and design â Humour â Nice animations â Good game engine and special effect â Overall nice presentation  â No Linux support.
5091	1	a	0 hours played but hey its 1$ and it has guns and dinosaurs thats a winner in my book  will release a full extensive review on this game
1762	1	a	Beep is a top class game with so much room for activites. I would recommend this to my closest children and mostly to bailey, happy shopping.
1689	1	a	A great platformer that soothes your nerves after a long tensed day!
