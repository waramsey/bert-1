608	1	a	its looks like GTA online free to play style
9297	0	a	clunky, horrible anmations, gameplay is slow, drawn out, and hitboxes are broken with little to no appropriate sound effects.
915	1	a	Free 2 Plays are the great.
7113	0	a	It sucks now... why? BECAUSE OF THE STUPID LAUCHER REFUSING TO WORK! Don't waist a total of 2 hrs of repairs and stuff plus solutions are useless. END OF STORY
4526	0	a	Worst 'free to play' game ever. Dont you even try playing this piece of poop. It will suck all your money.
4947	0	a	I got perma banned for nothing. Garbage game never want to play again. I do not reccomend anyone to play this, I put tons of money in the game and they banned me for no reason....
1464	1	a	I chased the Pink Nixon and found he was indeed a crook.
5983	0	a	I have Mafia II, why did I play this?
10519	1	a	Very fun game, requires much aiming, much skill. The one game where snipers are respectable.
1492	1	a	my nsame is Jeff
8489	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.
5158	0	a	it was so bad, i couldnt even get on the game the 16 minutes ive played was on the installing screen and then when i wanted to exit the game i couldnt even exit it i had to force close steam or restart my computer
2879	1	a	This is both the game I've had the most fun with but also the game I've been most frustrated with. It's great fun if you're playing in a party of 4, but playing solo or in any less than a group of 4 can be very aggrivating. If you have friends who can play with you, play it - otherwise, you'll just hate it. Also, a large amount of people hack.
1397	1	a	Amazing game, the only bad thing is it gets board over time.
1081	1	a	Now, I bought this game back in 2009. Yes, bought. $50, spent another $10 for 30 days of action district time. I had managed to obtain 6 months worth of action district time by selling Portal themed vehicles in the marketplace for subscription currency (it wasn't illegal, they had actually made a system for it). When this game was revived by GamersFirst, all of us who bought this game retail only got our original characters back as compensation. But... all of our character stats had been wiped. Why am I telling you this? So you'll be surprised to say that, despite being screwed over, this game is still addictive and fun enough to still jump back in and play from square one. Its an exceptionally fun game if you play with a good group of friends or a clan and use voice communication as well. Tactical team gameplay is a must for this game. If you have a coordinated team of players who use excellent gameplay tactics, you will hardly ever lose. A recommended download.
2336	1	a	It has nice graphics and all but the citizens are wierd lookings has a lot of bugs like the bug that i have that its like a screen multi color thing but i reccomend it
1236	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
7180	0	a	The game is not bad but...  It is hyper casual; bullet drop/damage are completely silly. If you are looking for a tactical team based competative shooter with realism and skill continue your search or I recommend CS:GO. If you want to have fun screw around and just blow stuff up and play grand theft auto for free, this is your game.  The review may seem harsh but it isn't a bad game just know what you want from your games and play it!
9600	0	a	- It takes too much time to master the controls - The quests are boring - The controls are quite complex and should be simplified - Its difficult to navigate to the easier areas of the map - You'll probally never get a horse  - Its fun to play for the first 5 hours
2752	1	a	I recommend this with the stipulation that your computer is better than average. This is a performance-intensive game, but it is worth it. The city of San Paro is beautiful, and the customization options you have for your characters and vehicles are remarkable. When a massive traffic jam causes problems, it can make for engaging gameplay - or it can bog down a subpar RAM setup.  It's a freemium game that under-delivered on the promises made by the original APB. While it is not a perfect game by any stretch, the interactions and gunfight scenarios available to you in the given setting are fantastic. This was GTA Online before there was a GTA Online. It's worth trying, at the very least.
7521	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. pay to win and even then you will have trouble due to the abulity to use hacks like aimbots. to many people use them in this and the admins do nothing about it. worst game iv played.
7901	0	a	Rip off of Saints Row. Enough said...
4950	0	a	Tried logging on again after a few months, my character gone and game support is doing nothing to get my character back. Game is also broken, from it's server lags and greedy game developers (approximately $30 for one gun!). The game is pay 2 win, barely any customization for free users. Would not recommend this game!
9632	1	a	This game is good to pass some time and to play a fun not to big rpg
1505	1	a	Well... not bad, not much good... I think you just need to try it...yeah...  SCORE: 69/100 (I guess)
8756	0	a	Poor Tutorial, no player base.
5909	0	a	.!.
5099	0	a	The only reason i got this was because i didn't bother to spend any money and want to practice driving for my driving test because i thought it would give me some level of experience.           I failed the test
4674	0	a	 A genuinely awful game.
9115	1	a	I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, 'Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you.' That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.
5503	0	a	wasted a minute and a half of my life downloading this game, to waste another 20 minutes getting the game to even start, to waste another 30 minutes trying to figure out why i had a blank black screen but could still hear the game sound, to finally waste another minute in a half figuring out that this game is not windows 10 compatible.....
2837	1	a	If your computer is from the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ future then you'll love this game. Luckily, I'm Christopher Lloyd so...yeah.
6946	0	a	The best part about this game is uninstalling it. &lt;3
189	1	a	One of the most entertaining games i have seen in years. lots to do, you can do missions with friends, or just mess around!
10389	0	a	Well I spawned in and the game was so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing glitchy that I couldn't out of the starting zone. Also the UI looks like â¥â¥â¥.
7727	0	a	Crap, absolute crap. Cars handle like roller skates, story is unimaginative.
1638	1	a	Slowly grinding my way up to supreme â¥â¥â¥â¥ bag, today I was able to kill 2 people and get 1 assist.  10/10 would die for my pride again.
8395	0	a	A dumbed-down and broken version of Saints Row.
7913	0	a	p2w so hard, however I wouldn't even recommend this to you p2w kids cause the people not paying are hackers. the little bit that's untainted by the greed of the first 2 groups is broken or just not good. has the potential to be awesome but it's not gonna happen
7031	0	a	first of all i had to do a 5hour update which isi just â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t second i had to download the game 2 times and it didnt even launch so dont get this game unless u want to spen 9 hours waiting 
4484	0	a	ONLY PLAY THIS GAME IF U ARE PREPARED FOR PAY TO WIN
7885	0	a	APB Reloaded is personally one of my favourite game. You can customise your character and your car! The guns are quite well-balanced.  However, there are many issue that is a hinderance to the game. Such examples will be unstable latency where if you stay in a country far from the server, you will not be able to move your character and shoot smoothly as people who stay in the country that has the server. Another problem is the premium guns where some free-players and beginners will find themselves in a serious disadvantage compared to premium players who has wide range of guns suited to their situations.  APB is one of those games where it feels good to play at first, but as times goes on, you will find yourself in a battle of keeping your interest alive of playing the game.  I give this a 5/10.   -Kiro
7728	0	a	What a piece of crap. It was free to play and I somehow wasted money on this game. :P Actually, it was trying to install the game. never actually 'played' it.
2521	1	a	Such an addicting game! Customization is phenominal, the ammount you can do is ridiculous. It does have a little bit of a learning curve, once you get it the satisfaction is very rewarding! Especially with the new engine underway this game is going to get better!  
5322	0	a	game wont let me drown myself :c  on a serious note i was doing the tutorial AND i accidently completed things without knowing what i was doing for one second.....0/10 â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s not worth it
4373	0	a	MM sucks, server lags most of the time.
2479	1	a	I love this game and always will :)
3713	1	a	It's great game about cops and criminals but need some huge update....
3253	1	a	Crim teams full of cheaters. Crashes all the time. Guns work for others but not for you. Free to play.
6393	0	a	nah. pay 2 win, pretty empty world, that stuff.  sounds great, but it just isn't.
6169	0	a	1 word. No its 3 words i think  PAY TO WIN
366	1	a	... 
5566	0	a	2 years ago I reviewed this game and said, 'Loading Screen Simulator 2014'  Now, I have a new computer and have recently played the game, like actual gameplay.   This is GTA online for poor people.
6532	0	a	This game was one of my favourite games...but it went really bad, but why ? The Armas Weapons (pay with real money) are really expensiv so you can pay up to 40â¬ for a account bounded sniper rifle. The most armas weapons are too strong like the 'scout' ,a new sniper rifle, you can shoot perfectly with it in the air you can use it outta a car and you can run with it...lets look on the free 2 play sniper rifle you cant do jumpshot you cant fire outta a car you cant run with it and the fire slower then the premium ones...but the biggest problem of the game is: that the gold players ( the strongest players haha ) play on the silver destricts or on bronze so you have no chance against some overpowered players who kick you out of the match in your own destrict...everything what i can say is: stay away from this game if you cant play in a team and if you wont pay money to win.
7852	0	a	Dont let the 35 hours fool you, I've been playing for some time long before the game has been out on steam.  Probably the greatest character customization I've seen to this date, players progressively unlock premade designs or simple shapes they use to design their own, it all depends on a players imagination on how much or what their character is wearing, along with how it all looks on them, the same goes for vehicles.  Weapon and vehicle viriety isn't all that bad, you're given some basic weapons and can later aquire some with mods and some with open slots for mods which have their own ups and downs; But weapons that players can pay real money for arent available to other players; some which, while not completely better than others, the situation they cover are more common than not, You're given a small Sadan but later on you can aquire different, faster, stronger, higher storage capacity cars and some for up to 4 people can shoot out of while on the move.  Player base wise, the game seems to consist of nothing but GIFTs, short for Greater Internet â¥â¥â¥â¥wad Theory, in which a Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total â¥â¥â¥â¥wad, expect to get a bunch of vile /whispers because someone that cant aim for â¥â¥â¥â¥ misses point blank with a high power sniper rifle with a slow rate of fire and you can nicely ventilate them with an automatic assault shotgun.  Driving in the game is rather floaty and awkward there is tad of a delay between the command and the vehicle doing the action. Guns have great sound but shooting pretty much forces players to aim down sights or in this game 'marksmanship mode' even in small street alleys at all times unless its an smg or some pistols, Time to kill in the game feels rather quick, dying between two or five hits depending if the weapon is a powerful hitter or a bullet hose, that along with the lack luster accuracy even in marksmanship mode means players wil spray entire magazines into each other until someone dies and getting a nice little whisper from the other player that you're a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or a hacker.  Finally the game has a sadly pants-on-head â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ way of choosing which server or 'district' you're forced to enter and who your enemies and allies are. A players Rank increases constantly, this would be your constantly progressing level and your Threat Level is how challenging the game perceives you, devided into Green, Bronze, Silver and Lastly Gold. the latter is sadly what the game keeps in mind about a player, districts are mainly devided by your Threat Level, so imagine a Golden Threat Rank 25 up against a Golden Threat Rank 150.   The game has a nice soundtrack, you can even play music from your MP3 library in the game if you wish, and players with that song can also hear it playing, you can also make a nice little 8-16 bit tune that will play for the player you've killed and play at the end of a round if you're the MVP.  All in all, if the game wasn't chock full of immature â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, guns that aren't accurate unless you're using the one sniper rifle available in marksmanship mode, crouched and still and player characters that die in 2-5 shots with no headshots to count I'd still play it.
8877	0	a	I love Fallen Earth! So many great memories in this game. I downloaded it in 2012 and deeply regret that I missed its early days. I still play it pretty regularly, but I can't willingly recommend it.   The player base is dwindling due to lack of advertising, non-existent updates, and what seems like complete abandonment from GMs/Devs. Every anniversary that I have in memory was met with a celebration for making another great year! And if you were subscribed you would receive an article of clothing with the game's name, usually. This year, (marking Fallen Earth's seventh) there were only three redeem codes to celebrate it. Just depressing.  I unfortunately can't see a future for this game, if this continues. Recommending Fallen Earth is just letting gamers waste time, effort, and money for a game on its last leg. It pains me to write this because I don't want this game to end, but have no power to change its fate.
5033	0	a	Pay to win. Ekh... Sure it's fun-- but completing missions is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with fighting all of the people who spent money on the game.
613	1	a	Here are my thoughts about this game. With the the new engine update coming out the game will now have things open to it that it did not before, with a better engine not only means better graphics but the potentital to expand into something new and refreshing.  The game is good and it's been good to me for a sold 2-3 years now, now I've had my fair share of breaks, trust me. However, there is no other game that can compete with this in terms of customization. That is the sole reason I come back to this game everytime. The customization is so in depth that it makes MMORPG's with their super detailed character creation look like child's play. (Opinion)   Yes there are flaws in the games mechanics that could use some work, but if you look past that and focus on the game itself, it's a great game with lots of potential to grow yet.
2069	1	a	This game is amazing. Any game I can build a Mystery Machine and rob stores with it, I am for it.
6256	0	a	today this game is pay2win.. y dont need skill anymore in this game y have use moneyz
8839	0	a	Im pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that the game could not properly install or run. I've been at it for a few hours now troubleshooting endlessly.  1. I had problems with the launcher installing Visual C++ 2005, 2010, etc. 2. Every time i launch it says installing Direct X, making no progress as far as i can tell. I checked my task manager and could see the Direct X installer doing its thing. Yet every time i launch it tries to install Direct X again. 3. I recieved an error that said something about it not installing properly. I changed the properties for the launcher so that it ran as administrator, hoping it would fix the problem, alas no progress.  Im pretty dissapointed, I was excited to play the game, and still am but this is frustrating.
2094	1	a	Really fun, any guns that are available for real money can be obtained with in game currencey. My only complaint is that it will sometimes randomly lag for apparently no reason, but but other than that it's a really fun game that's deffinentally worth a try.
7984	0	a	This is one of those subscription games that had to go free-to-play because they couldn't convince people to keep giving them money, and it shows. The controls are clunky: you have to go through 2-3 menus every time you want to change anything. Anything at all. The vehicles maneuver not quite as well as a fat dog on a trampoline. The player base is one of the worst I've ever seen with regards to team killing 'for lulz' and just congenital inability to cooperate. If you've got your heart set on playing a free shooter with some vehicles, download Planetside 2. Even as flawed as that game is you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.
6975	0	a	This game is like gta 3 on â¥â¥â¥â¥ steroids handles horrible, tutorial is harder than the final Mario boss battle, and the driving engine f*****g sucks this game is sooooo not worth your computer's disk space.
3323	1	a	ruined my life :D liek if yuo kry evrey tiem!
1818	1	a	Combine Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row 3 add some MMORPG and free to play marketing system and you have this.
10226	1	a	This game has its own unique charm. I mainly played it when it was a P2P payment model. It has gotten a lot better and is unfortunatly under-rated. Although it still has some of its issues with animations and what not there is something that sparkles in this MMO's eyes. The crafting is genius and sometimes it feels like im in a real open world experience. Its built well to immerse you out of the MMO feel and not in a bad way. The combat is fun since you can approach it many different ways. Again with the crafting, its amazing.   There is absoultely nothing as satisfying as crafting your first ATV. Its a pinnacle moment of â¥â¥â¥â¥ yeah im bad. Another thing i really like is the no class style along with the in depth RPG elements. Im not really a fan of no class MMO's but it works perfect for Fallen Earth. My main issues with the game is for some people it can be somewhat confusing although the new tutorial is really helpful. I hope the community welcomes people who try the game with open arms. It would be a shame if it ever got shut down. City of Heroes was a tragic loss in all honesty for the MMO genre and would equally be so if Fallen Earth was to. Remember FE players, never make the new guys hate the game because you want to be an Eliteist and call the noobs and what not. That helps games die away.   All in all. My experience with FE has been one of a kind. Im going to give it another go with the F2P and see where i can go all over again. If you havent tried it, give it a go. Its worth getting into. It will seem odd and wierd at first but once you get used to it you will discover the genius behind this game.
8112	0	a	I have not yet got to play this game , However it states that i have played for 89 mins. untrue I can not even get into it and i have loged in iI have created and regiestered but have yet to play the damed game what the hell is it. I am taking every thing out of my laptop now and forgetting I even tried this god awlful game bye bye
9526	1	a	IT WAS AWESOME ALMOST AS AWESOME AS THE 4 DAY DOWNLOAD!!!
2054	1	a	Giant Bilbo Baggins Mess up 
7922	0	a	i tried to download this and right at the end it error'ed on me lol played Hounds the last hope played it got to mission 5 map would not instal nice to see how games have gone down the drain and say f2p when u p2w
8670	0	a	There's a lot of reasons giving this thumbs down let me just give you some reasons before you play this.  First you'll hear kids on the mic flaming so bad, you'll see disrespectful words all over the chat people disrespecting each others every time  Joining gta V is faster than joining this game  Unfair play as you gotta pay money to get a godlike weapons and 80% of losing the missions, people playing there for years like robots killing you with a shotgun from a far distance  Glitches everywhere, you send APB support a ticket and they don't respond as i sent them a ticket a year ago how to fix my game i didn't get any reply from them  Hard to drive cars you gotta get used to them  As you're in a mission and you responding to something and finally get used to the cars people will come with a truck and ram your car to a wall and then it'll show that you suicide as they're not even your teammates or enemys to hurt you  Your teammates sometimes get butthurt and they killing you, after asking them why they trolling the game and killing me what i get is 'Because you're a really bad player learn how to play you dumbâ¥â¥â¥â¥ and you responded to the mission late so pls uninstall apb'    The game is free like there's no point going against the game and giving it thumbs down but again you gotta pay to be a godlike you gotta pay a lot of money.
8690	0	a	Got banned from the game for no reason. 10/10 Would make new account.
3300	1	a	This game is very great i love it.
3618	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
46	1	a	It sucks so hard but I keep coming back to it.
7841	0	a	I had heard nothing but good things about this game, decided to try it... couldn't delete it fast enough.  â¢ Character Custimization: Beyond slow. Unless I randomized it, I wasn't able to create jack s**t for my character. â¢ In Game: I watched as my boyfriend got in game (finally), only to struggle to find where a 'locker' was located with his clothes he had just bought....ONLY to discover that everything he had just spent money on wasn't even there.   IMO this could have been something great, it just seems little effort was put in to it.
3748	0	a	this game could have been the best online shooter of the 21st century.  but gamersfirst.
5182	0	a	Well. It's been about 2 years. Time to try this again.  I can say I am not shocked to find there have been no major non-cosmetic/cash shop expansions. Customization, the games major draw, hasn't seen any much needed enhancement either.  I did not run into any hackers but there are a LOT less people playing the game now.  Matchmaking still sucks and the game plays like a 5 minute edit of the Unreal engine.  My advice remains the same. Play the game if you want but do not pay this company.
9029	1	a	I decided to wander and ended up in a different town where a semi-naked guy gave me a duster.  10/10
4595	0	a	Worst game i ever seen,  Its impossible to play on here, lags everywhere even if i have a GREAT computer. When it crashes, it screws all my system up and then i have to restart my comp.  And its like this from the start of the game, its getting much worse than the old times. Dont download it, youll regret if you do.
821	1	a	Imagine if you put aids and terminal cancer together, then made it a game this is what would come out of it.   Welcome to AidsPointsBulletin one of the worst managed free to play games you've ever seen. Bundled with the worst anti cheat anyone has ever seen in their life and players with brains as equally as smart as dead sperm cells.
5697	0	a	its piece of crap on a stick
39	1	a	Its a lot of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of those - like me - who gets frustrated when you die.  This is a game of skill. There's no classes and no real perks or talents that can give you an advantage in a fire fight. Buying weapons character modifications (such as body armor) can increase your chances, but only slightly and will not necessarily make it impossible for a new player to kill you if you make a mistake.
7583	0	a	'Kicked from server for exesive team killing'. Why does it have a name if you arent allowed to do it. Should call it boredom relief, maybe team poppin'. Anywho, game is a money trap, if you have money you dont want or like anymore, go ahead and waste it on this game. So many people look like speed hackers equiped with guns that shoot straight and/or long distance.
3959	0	a	The game starts out great you can ride with your friends stealing or protecting and then IT haappens the pay2win you join a match eryone is the same lvl and the otther team has maxed out everything best armor,cars,guns and then the actual system(im looking at you punkbuster) Kicks you because it basically wanted to. Finding allies is hard the only thing you can do later on is really hide in a corner till your character commits suicide
3252	1	a	... Pay to the win.

5089	0	a	I played it for 5 years.In the begining game was awesome later it was boring and full of hackers.. The biggest â¥â¥â¥â¥ is that u need to pay with real money for space weapons-opp to win.. As i told already game is full of hackers... The biggest one is that the game is not proteceted well i lost my 3 maxed chars 10mill in cash lost everything. Now im proud bcs i stopped playing this crap.. The Gamersfirst company only thinks about money u give...... If u pay them u r goood person if u dont pay u r no one remember that!!!!!!!
8219	0	a	Pros: Strongest customization ive seen.  Cons: Hackers galore.   Pay to win  Renting system for guns.  Matchmaking system is terrible.  Missions tend to be 1 sided.   
9656	1	a	Got bludgeoned too death, gained flight  10/10 would be cloned again

7155	0	a	doesnt even launch just takes you to a facebook page   EDIT: managed to get past the facebook page issue it launched closed itself out after about a minute then locked up my steam and i cant get rid of it i have no options but to restart my computer to be able to play any real games and delete this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ so in end if you want to break steam download this game and have fun breaking steam i sure as hell didnt
425	1	a	awsome 
9601	1	a	it too many tools to kill some i can't cont all of them and cars are good to
10087	1	a	my first game, it was fun than got old
1952	1	a	best free game ever you will love it 
4347	0	a	What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load. Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up. I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.

5756	0	a	Love the idea of this game. What I don't like is that it feels like playing counter strike. Everyone spends their time jumping up and down to avoid bullets. And the initial load up procedure is horrible.

7480	0	a	When I first started playing this game, I thought this game was interesting. But after about a few weeks of play the terrible gun balancing finally got me. You can manage to get kills with your starter equipment with serious metagame startegy, but the whole fool your enemy thing can go wrong quickly when they spot you trying to sneak up on them. So, I bought some of the in-game currency weapons. I still didn't stand a chance to the people who bought from the Arma Marketplace. The only thing that kept me going for longer than I should was the customization, you can customize almost anything of yours. That is the only thing I can complement about this game. Serious Pay To Win.
6384	0	a	Well APB reloaded is a fun game in customizing but the gameplay is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this is because the game is way too crowded with hackers and pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s who spend $250 on virtual items wich you only keep for 3 days.  So no, I do NOT recommend this game to anyone! Avoid at all costs!

5977	0	a	This game doesn't load, it put a virus on my computer, and I spent literally 10 HOURS waiting for this to download hoping I could get some fun out of this game.I would only recomend this game if you have a TON of other things to do while it downloads There is one more thing you HAVE to have for this game to work, a really,really strong computer.
7920	0	a	While this game does stand out in so many ways from others, it is flunked and here's why  The good : Best customization I've seen on any game - Fun gameplay ( even though it is super frustrating at times ) - Decent Graphics for the time - Is free - and is FUN  the bad / ugly: In my 5-6 Years of gaming, Never in my LIFE have I ever seen such terrible matchups. When open conflict district came out, I was surprised when I realized that the matchmaking isn't completly random, Only 3 major threats which is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Your 4 man crew which may have total of 100 hours ( all 4 guys combined ) WILL get setup against another 4 man crew of max ranks, each having 2500+ hours each. How is this balanced? Not to mention the prices are thru the â¥â¥â¥â¥ING roof. 80$ for an outfit and a car bodykit. Seriously? I can buy two copies of GTA v for that. The game is SORTA dead. In 2013, Obeya, the most popular server had 5000-7500 Players at peak hours. Now, Obeya has about 1300 peak hours. Colby, the most unpopular server, has about 200 on at peak hours. The game is BRUTAL towards noobs, mostly due to the fact that decent players ( Who are actually silver threat ) get gold SOOO easily and purposely have to dethreat to fight silvers, Leaving no room for the bronzes to learn. There aren't as many hackers anymore thanks to fairfight, but since there are rerolls due to the fact that the game is free, PUNKBUSTER IS NONEXSISTENT and has no banned one single cheater. Cheaters will be banned in 1-5 days from fairfight but then will make new accounts. The game is laggy unless youre on a PC over 1000$+ The worst GM's who ban people who are good against them when theyre streaming. Legits getting banned everywhere. Lack of REAL updates. The last 10 updates have been Armas market stuff ( more stuff that costs 40$ )    Bottom line: APB is such a good game that deserves a try and can be AMAZING with several patches. I would NOT recommend spending a single dollar on this game until the devs get their act together.

10053	1	a	Rich in content and F2P, no real pay wall that I've noticed.  One of the best MMOs for weak hardware, runs great on my super old laptop AMD A6-4400 APU, which is weaker than an intel integrated laptop gpu from 2013.  The grind is there but not too excessive.  You get a horse early on and other useful equipment like guns.   Easy-ish to learn. Can be confusing at first or if you haven't played in a very long time.  Great looking environments.  Can not be beat for free price tag, i'd say even at $20 it would be a great bergain. I'm not sure why people don't recommend this game more. I've always had fun in my short time with it.
10335	1	a	I really like this game, it's just that it's starting to feel old and I want something more and something new. I can't find a game like this anywhere else and it makes me sad.

10634	1	a	This game is a free fast-paced FPS with mostly ballistic weapons and awesome movement mechanics including jetpacks and a complete friction loss from the ground. And because gliding + hills + speed + ballistic weapons = hard to hit, this game is difficult. And awesome. Now to get a little more precise, the movement can be compared with the little iOS game tiny wings, where you slide through the little gaps between round hills and fly around as fast as you can, but this is 3D. The weapons are mostly in one of these 3 categories: Explosive weapons fire slowly, have rather slowly flying projectiles with splash damage and extreme damage on a direct hit, while bullet based guns (autos) fire rather fast flying little projectiles dealing high damage per second if you manage to hit all shots and the usually weakest but easy to aim hitscan weapons, which work as all guns do in 'modern shooters'. You point at an enemy and when you click, they die. As you may have guessed, to be good at the game you should be able to handle guns from the first category, which are the way it's meant to be played and the only real honorable option (Debatable, I know, discuss it on reddit or whatever). The fast movement is hard to control in the beginning and hitting fast people with ballistic weapons can be extremely hard. This is what puts game's skill ceiling so high. The community is not as big as it used to be, by now the game is slowly dying (  http://steamcharts.com/app/17080#All  ). Still, there's always enough EU servers filled to join in a suitable game for me, so I will be enjoying the game for a long time. The good players are friendly to each other, the few toxic parts of the community are found in low-level servers and quit plaing sooner or later. Your first matches will be on these novice servers, although you will soon reach level 10 just to be thrown into games with the seasoned veterans when you know little about the game but the basics. This makes it even harder for new players.  So, to come to a conclusion: The game is awesome, but difficult. We can use more new players learning with each other instead of getting wrecked by pros, so give it a try. What you can have for free is one of the best multiplayer shooters out there. Prepare to get owned! Don't be frustrated, it's bound to happen. Continue playing and think about what you do, learn from the enemy and you will get better.  Have fun!

3889	0	a	The game does not have a big enough playerbase for new players to get into the game.  Started off my first game against people that had better pistols than my assault rifle. I was getting sniped before even getting to the objective with a revolver.   So if you're not down to put $60-100 into the game there's no way you're gonna be able to enjoy this.

It takes half of your lifetime to get it downloaded and logging in takes up more time than me actually playing this piece of trash. I had to turn my computer off 4 times in 2 hours because it froze my computer or prevented me from playing anything else. I feel like an old person after how much time I've wasted trying to give my effort purpose. How could Steam even consider bringing this horrible mess into their beautiful community of great to way better than APB Reloaded games. Gaben hear my words you awesome god and burn this evil game of devil spawn at the stakes, please.
588	1	a	Its probably the best game i've ever played , but mainteance of the G1 is a serious issue and ruins it for everyone  However game is still playable and has about 1000-1500 players daily on Citadel (EU server)  I vote yes for game and no for G1

10738	1	a	I remember playing this game all the way back when it was in beta and I bought a supporter package for it then. I was also quite good at flag running then, unfortunately I am now trash and the game is very different from what I remember.   But the things that haven't changed is the fact that it is a fun, fast paced, unforgiving, strategic shooter with loads of rewarding teamplay involved. I was glad to hear that the game is on it's way back from death. It was a noble thing for the developers to do even though they don't stand to make much money out of this. Although some people have mentioned lack of servers, those must be old reviews while the game was still abandoned as I had no trouble finding servers in the US. Since the game is free there is really no reason not to pick it up and try it at the very least and I would recommend doing so.
2681	1	a	this game is awesome! love the Customization in it, and its just really fun driving around as a cop :D lol!! highly recomend ^_^

5206	0	a	its a bad game to play for people who like gta style type gaming because the game itself isn't realistic and gun aren't good too 
337	1	a	So much wasted potential, but still such a gem of a game. If you can get past the flaws it's an amazing game. The customization is unrivaled, character, clothing, cars, graffiti, and minor gun skinning. I personally enjoy the combat system. There are quite a few guns to choose from and each performs well within its niche, and the most of the 'pay to win' guns are re-skins of in-game unlockables.  System reqs:    You can play this game alright on a dual core with 4-6 gb of ram and a 1gb video card, but your experience will suffer greatly. My personal reccomendation: Quad code cpu 8gb ram 2gb or greater gpu 64 bit OS -my build for reference-    i5-3570k @ 4.5 ghz 8 Gb ddr3 @ 1866 Nvidia GTX 660 DCU II       I'm going to go ahead and insert my  tl;dr  here.  Good game overall. Small problem with hackers, free game.. (more than you know, less than you think). Customization makes this game a  must try .      Contd...  There are only two 'large' scale mission maps, they've been around since day one. Though it does get old, they really are great maps. Some mission locations can be one sided, but the overall feel of them is balanced. Now, on to the fight club maps. There are three total 'Fight Club' maps, with only two of them being active. Baylan Shipping and Storage is a small-mid size map with lots of high vantages and low cover. This map is great for any class, but is usually dominated by snipers. Asylum, it finally happened.. Asylum was originally supposed to be a kind of faction specific social district... long story. Asylum is technically still being developed for a yet to be released game-mode, but is an amazing indoors close-quarter to mid-range combat map. Then there's Beacon, the inactive map. Beacon was originally released with Baylan, but was temporarily de-activated in favor of Asylum. Nobody knows if or when it will come back, but it's mainly a close-quarters pointman map. Finally, there's Social District. Social is, as in many games, separate experience from the other districts. There are often many public conversations and arguments going on at once, some with roots going back to closed beta. Beyond that are the customization booths. There are booths for writing your own songs, writing your own death theme your vanquished opponent will hear, customizing symbols (for many purposes), vehicle customization (uses symbols), and character customization (can use symbols). There is also an in-game marketplace where players can sell their custom creations to others. That's as long-winded as I can handle tonight. Maybe one day I'll revise it.

8708	0	a	Overall? A massive disappointment I came back to a couple times in hopes it had gotten better. Sadly, it never did.  Such a shame, I loved being a wheelman for people.
8597	0	a	awefull balance on top of P2W and cancerous community.  Amazing character creation system, spoiled by the terrible actual gunfights where if you dont submitt to the meta of the game (tank LMG, or clotting SMGs/shotguns/RPGs.) then you will always be at a disadvantage.  Game developers are cancer with the players, constantly worsening the game and adding in just more pay to win aspects to the shop, all of which cost about $30-40 just for a permanent single weapon. Having added almost no extra maps besides 2 small arena modes and 2 open conflict (kill on sight) versions of the already present ones.  No graphical updates, and the only vehicle diversity among players you'll see or hear is either loud crotch grabbing rap music or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ over compensating short â¥â¥â¥â¥ metal/hard rock with only either Humvee vehicles to troll payers with ramming outside of missions, or a mustang based car thats only got speed on its side.  Faction balance is also thrown away, enforcers seem to be a high risk, high reward play style, with the only way to gain money being missions or alot from arrests. You can earn money through impounding stolen vehicles and evidence delivery or witnessing but good luck as most players on criminals are smart to remain unwitnessable and rarely use any vehicle but their own unless they are new, making enforcer faction practically impossible to earn a decent cash sum up on unless you get good gear. On the other hand criminals can get money practically anywhere, and can reach a $1000-2000 bounty extremely quickly, before being unwitnessable by just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing away from normally quiet areas. Giving criminals an almost endless suply of cash when needed, as well as having the population majority based there. (probably due to that.)  You know how i mentioned arresting criminals in apb as an enforcer? Good luck as well, without the stun shotguns or the taser you stand no chance from premium weapons or rather really any guns. The AR based one requires 7 hits of a 20 round magazine and when players are jumping and running speedy gonzales, then your bound to have almost no spare ammo.  The character customization is amazing, and personally this game's selling point, but again, its squandered by the fact that you cant unlock anything clothing wise fast enough to expand customization. Though if your a good artist you can make a pretty penny from the marketplace from your clothing creations, and probably could turn a profit that way.   The map lay outs and draw distance is honestly some of the worst i've seen. The draw distance has only ever gotten worse becuase people complained about snipers, now its at 100 meters, where litterally any pistol could outgun you, so the only 'snipers' you'll see are corner peekers and jump shooters. When this game has so many potential campaing spots with hard to reach manners, and dont give me the anti-camp â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Its a legitimate defense strategy in video games if given the option, you complaining about it is the same thing as the allies saying â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to germany during WW1 for using submarines when it was a practical and obvious choice for the war of attrition.  On top of the draw distance all the mission lay outs are CQC based, litterally no sniping spots are able to oversee the positions of objectives, and this brings me to another major flaw:  THE RED â¥â¥â¥â¥ING NAME TAG. AT THE MAX DRAW DISTANCE your given an extremely bright, red, nametag thats litterally visible to everyone even looking around, and this litterally makes it impossible to flank, snipe, or even set up actual good coordinated stationary defensive ambushes.  I do like one aspect of the gameplay and its that the minimap is only gunfire, and audio based. You will not see enemies on the minimap if they make no noise, or are not spotted (good luck not being spotted for reason above.)  The ranking system for pvp is also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, golds can ACTIVELY put themselves lower rank, thus fighting people litterally lower tier than them, think of CSGO an global elite versus new players to the game. Which msot of the time you wont see green tier servers (which are the only locked ones.) having player counts enough to support new players healthily.  The vehicle handling on almost every early-mid tier vehicle is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and delayed. Taking a full second to actrually obey a command to turn or such, the only exception is fast cars, which leads me to believe its speed based. Meaning all those mustang based car users (forgot actual name.) are, again, getting the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the game.   I give this game a 2/10.  I'll only rarely even think of touching this game, and thats mostly for customization amazingness, but like i said, thats really its only selling point. BF: HARDLINE Was legitimately better than this game in every field but its Dead on PC, the only reason this isnt the case is everyone loves the customization thats never present in any other shooter. That and the P2W buddies are willing to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on their OP weapons which the devs refuse to nerf. (check the forums, youll never see patch notes for weapons that involving decreasing or increasing any stats unless they are sniper rifles or other weapons that are never used. The AK47 (N-tec) was one of the only competitive rifles to use against SMGs and they nerfed its tap fire, but they havent even touched the commonly used p2w weapons.)  My recomendation for improvement: Kill this game, and actively dont play any gamers-first games, if we're lucky theyll do a 180 turn and actrually balance it once they see profits go down (this is what happens with games like warface which was a notoriously bad P2W before finally shaping up and are now semi-decent F2P games.).  Otherwise, i dont see hope for this game. Its loosing a small amount of players every 2 weeks, which is honestly a good sign, and it finally lost its positive status which was litterally just people trying to sympathize with the game due to its character creation aspects and unique cops vs criminals....or nostalgia. All of which never address the issues of the game or handling balance issues seriously enough.

8730	0	a	It's a great game, the pewpew action is very satisfying. The sound is absolutely incredible! And i'm always a sucker for games with the level of customization that APB has. However: The hacking is absolutely ridiculous. It takes two shots to kill someone with a sniper rifle, but people will kill you with two bullets from a side arm. Then there's the ability to shoot through walls (not as bad as CS used to be). Many times i will hit the wall I'm hiding behind, with half my body exposed. But other people will have barely a head showing, and waste you.   I try to play bad, so I can go back down in threat, where the hackers are not prominent. But it's tedious. If you can tolerate the hacks, it's a great game. I will unlikely spend money on this until they fix that. I'd uninstal entirely, but my character looks badass.
1837	1	a	Love the limitless customization. But the community is not really good due idling the newbie. No pay to win, In-game weapon still can killng the enemy. But the only problem is when the higher rank player get a better gear and shooting you all time.

8138	0	a	APB Reloaded is, in my experience, a good and fun concept gone wrong. Server lag hits often, meaning that only people who pay for top-notch internet can keep going without any interruptions. The matchmaking system is undeniably the worst I have ever seen. 10 minutes in and I get thrown into a match with people who have nothing but machine guns that can blow up my car in less time than I can react, and even if I'm outside of a car, that thing can still rip me a new one while I still have my stock assault rifle. I've heard about cheaters and hackers, but I don't recall ever encountering one, though it's hard to tell when many weapons are essentially 2-4 shot kills. The weapons are good and do their job right. The assault rifles are neither good nor bad at anything in particular, the shotguns are guarunteed kills at close range, snipers are excellent at long range. But the machine guns, those things are over powered. As stated before, the machine guns can destroy vehicles in about 2 or 3 seconds of sustained fire. Most people cruise around in their stock cop/criminal cars which can't withstand too much fire and end up dead. They also have insane range and accuracy. The only weakness I've heard about them is that they suffer an absolutely terrible drop in accuracy when moving, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as it claims since I've been bum rushed by several people who just spray-n-pray. The only thing good about the game is the game modes and progression system, but with the problems I mentioned before one would have to take this with a mountain of salt. Like I said at the begginning of my review, it's a good concept that suffers from bad design and maintenance.

10754	1	a	Something's tearing me down And I can't help but feel it's coming from you She's a gunshot bride With a trigger cries I just wonder what we've gotten ourselves into  In a trail of fire I know we will be free again In the end we will be one In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me Set your sights for the sun  Mind is willing Soul remains This woman cannot be saved From the drawn into the fire  Mind is willing Soul remains This woman cannot be saved From the drawn into the fire  Anything to Bring it on home Bring it on home Bring it on home Bring it on home  Much too weak to jump yourself Heal the wounds or crack the shell Lift yourself from once below  Much too weak to jump yourself Heal the wounds or crack the shell Lift yourself from once below  Praise the anger Bring it on home Bring it on home Bring it on home Bring it on home  In a trail of fire I know we will be free again In the end we will be one In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me Set your sights for the sun Bring it on home 
1346	1	a	it's fun try itr out
7481	0	a	I hate this game! Everybody you come across seems to be a much higher level than you with lots of game experience and awsome weaons, as for me, I only just started and got anihalated by averyone. They all had rocket launchers and grenade launchers, all I had was a pistol and SMG!
3294	1	a	Just don't be a crooked cop.
8121	0	a	Well what can i tell you that has not already been said, this game was fair and loaded with hackers but still playable in the beginning and as time passed it went down hill. I am a senior player with max level characters and you can take this review for what it is, my experiences over time  few examples 1. Devs/GMs have there fav players make them testers, as representatives of the game they get free weapons the problem is they have the poorest attitude and only promote a bad gaming experience, and trying to report them is like trying to put a 3 inch nail in concrete with a playschool hammer, the GMs and Devs are useless cardboard cutouts, lol and they like to ban people for speaking there mind and challenging them when they are being one sided to there friends. This is what you get when you let untrained people run a company and a game with sooooooo much potential  2. still a horrible balance system, bugs and lag out the butt even after this long and one sided spawning, placing one player at 50m from item and the other 400m  3. Lol the world saving new anti cheat system and the root of most of the new problems FAIRFIGHT. Don't get me wrong I love this anti cheat as it fished out all of the players you already knew were hacking and was good for some lols when you read the forums from the top rankers who were banned, but it gave G1 some thing new to focus on how to make there game a pay to play again. The solution? Tweaked armas guns. Yes most of these guns are just reskins of stock weapons but...... the stats are tweaked just enough so that with the right mods you will out perform any free to play weapon, crack your wallets open now  4. lol 'the children have come out to play'. To many wet behind the ears, window licking kids on here now. They got mommy's credit card and and a whinny mouth that won't close, they are usually the first ones to cry hacker at a loss or cry noob to other players at a win you will never here a gg from them, and its only going to get worse when the console kids get on....THIS I HOPE WILL BE THE FINAL NAIL IN THIS GAMES SAD DOWNFALL COFFIN  Most senior players and clans have long abandoned this game you see them from time to time usually in the chat room visiting but most of the GG players are gone, they have a good nose they can smell when something is dead  I'm not saying don't try it but just be warned this is what you get to look forward to
2225	1	a	Best thing to realize is that i cant play the damn thing because my account doesnt 'Work' and im stuck at the damn loading screen forever  10/10 Would play loading screen simulator again.
4026	0	a	Classical Pay2Win free2play game. Low fps even on a 6 core with a 7850 2GB. Definitely don't recommend playing.
209	1	a	nice game is funy gl hf the cops are cool  Das spiel sit geil habt spaÃ und viel glÃ¼ck Bulle zu sein ist cool 
2093	1	a	seriously, wtf are you doing reading this? PLAY THIS GAME!!  APB is an online 3rd person â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t simulator.  Hours of fun can be had and sometimes you just cant help yelling 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!' at your screen as you get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you.  Though nothing beats the feeling of rolling in a car through the city with some good friends who you know got your back.
538	1	a	Play from Australia and it is unbelievably delay for driving a car. It is like max out the driving difficulty. :P But what make this game so good is a extreme customisations that I never ever see before.
7193	0	a	Wont load on startup the menu comes us then it crashes
10220	0	a	For those of you somewhat interested in this game, I can review it for you in three words: No, Just No.
3735	1	a	Im not kidding, but my computer was so bad that 20hrs were spent trying to launch it and one time when I closed it, it didnt close properly.
1898	1	a	Its like cops and robbers ! accept better!
6066	0	a	This game has a lot of pros it's true.. But sadly to access those pros you will need to pay. A LOT. The customization from this game is incredibile you can make your car or character look exactly how you want it to look. But you need to pay for different bodykits for cars, or better clothes, or more space to add symbols on those things. If you are happy with a stock car and a simple outfit go for it but after that you will be surprised how much you can hate this game.. Always getting matched against more experienced opponents or players with premium weapons that are too overpowered to be killed. Seriously, those who can actually spend money on a game like this will get all the good stuff, giving new players reasons to not play this unfinished game. I guess the worst part of this game is the company that is curently developing it. This game is pay 2 win. If you want to try it, go for it but you will need a large wallet to play properly. Enjoy.
9051	1	a	Post-Apocalyptic MMO . . can't get any better then this. A bit slow to level but good world size.
1355	1	a	really fun game like gta but not just simply fun and cool
10780	1	a	I usually hate multiplayer games, but I have been with this game since the Closed Beta and poured in over 200 hours ever since and its's by far the most FUN multiplayer game ever made.
3960	0	a	This game sounds interesting, but matching system is totally BROKEN. You will force matched lv50ish veterans in first ten minuites and got bullied AGAIN AND AGAIN. Do not play this. ------------------- ãããã³ã°ã¶ã£å£ãã¦ãããã§ãããã©ã³å¢ã«ããã³ããã¾ãã
3440	1	a	I would say it is a pretty solid game, it's just that the Pay to Win is a bit too obvious but with the majority being f2p I think it is not a big problem.
4509	0	a	For the love of god, don't play this game..
7257	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
7865	0	a	Fun game but pay 2 win and hacks are everywhere
9515	0	a	What the hell!!! I went through all of the time making an account for this game, to be back at the login screen with it prompting me for a username and a password, when the acccount creation didn't allow me to enter in a username, anywhere. Dumbasses! How am I supposed to log in with something I don't have?
10047	0	a	This game is not good after the level capped you dont have nothing to do (no Pvp's no raid's)
7224	0	a	After 5 years the game still has delays that exist for no reason and you can still shoot through walls.
4536	0	a	Tried to play it but it wasn't the open world free to play game I expected, The maps were tiny and there were set things to do on each map which I didn't like, also it kept telling me to kill people with bounties but never told me where they were. All I really did was die and then got bored.
10280	0	a	i recommend this
2127	1	a	This game is brillant
10269	1	a	I have started playing this game this week and have found it to be a enjoyable one. the game is much like fallout if you liked that game then you would enjoy. the graphics are ok but i find that this gives this game a diffrent feel and in away the fact theat their not amazing has given it a diffrent look and aspect and me personal enjoye this about it as now a days its all about the graphics and this gives a brake from that. thir seems to be a problem with the landscape loading and then doesent buffer as well as not a frecent movement seem to be laggey ( friends have had same problem) but besides that what i have played so far is enjoyable. i would recomend this game to people who enjoy games like fallout.hope you have the same enjoyment i have had and i hope it continuse thought the game for me
9782	0	a	This game is bad whan it comes to even making the account i cant even login because when you register it doesn't let typing a username.
1888	1	a	'The best part of this game is not just the shooting and guarding the objective.' The best part of this game is that god gaben made the uninstall button as bright as the game and easy to find than finding a bloody opponent    see the 2.2 hour i wasted on that game? it takes that long to be diagnosed with brain cancer   
3883	0	a	Hackers, Hackers everywhere. :)
3099	1	a	one problem is figuring out wht weapon you want because it dosent show weather it is semi burst or full auto
5684	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
4781	0	a	Well that was 3.7 hours I'm never getting back.  APB, apparantly, was once a brilliant open-world game with players joining the ranks of either the police force or the criminal thugs as they battle it out in gamemodes and on the streets. However, it went horribly wrong at some point and now we are left with this mess.  APB was and still is an open world shooter with missions, ranks and unlocks, and granted, I enjoyed my first hour or so customising my thug to be what I liked to call 'Bootleg Batman'. I had read the reviews saying that its horrible and its 'A good game gone bad', but I was willing to give it a go.  My first hour went something like this, I opened the game and was greeted with a character customisation screen. I've always been a sucker for customisation options so I was eager to get started. When I did eventually finish I got into the game, did the tutorial (there wasn't much of one anyway) and drove my car around. I began looting shops for the next hour and then I decided it was a good idea to do a mission. How wrong I was.  The mission went horribly. The people against us had overpowered rifles and rocket launchers, and they just ploughed through our cars like they were made of tinfoil. After this, I came to the conclusion that it was just a fluke, an unlucky game. I tried a few more, it was the same thing. I did this about 10 times before giving up entirely.  My point is, is that there is no balance system, so noobs and general idiots don't get cut any slack. Not to mention the disgustingly cancerous community. I'm pretty sure I became a tumour after I was finished with this game, it was either Russian fetuses shouting â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or some idiot blaming everyone but himself for not winning, and don't even get me started on the open world trolls. You cant even walk 6 feet without getting your brains splattered all over the badly textured walls by some sniper that's half way across the small 'open world' map.  To finish off, don't get this, don't think of it, don't even think of thinking of it, otherwise you will get tumours. Either that or you'll play long enough to become the tumours.  tl:Dr here:  Pros:   Customisation system, and a good one too, its fleshed out and you can customise all of your car and your clothing  Cons:   No balancing system, low levels get the benefit of losing their faces to high level sniper rifles repeatedly  The cars handle horribly, its like I driving on ice  The textures are terrible  Cancerous community, take your pick from Russian fetuses, 6 year old idiots and human swear machines  Trolls (also cancerous, but deserves its own listing), snipers camp the  rooftops rocket launcher guys stalk the ground, and smell the fresh noob meat.  Grindfest, takes a week to get anything of value.     Just, don't bother with this.
3897	0	a	This game is ok, I still would not reccomend it unless you have a group of friends to play with. Dont expect to have things like in the pictures unless you spend the time and design the patterns on your own or are willing to pay for it.
2265	1	a	Pay To Have Swag.... This will hold me off until gta5 comes to pc.
10132	1	a	So much fun from a well designed free to play game! Never thought they would be this good.
2140	1	a	It always opens to the updating screen but no progress happens. What should I do?
3978	0	a	DAT CRASH SO BAD
3325	1	a	The coolest free to play game of all times, iv'e really got addictet to it. come and play with me.
8126	0	a	Classic game. But you don't want to put any money on it.
7006	0	a	This game is ludicrously frustrating, but I can't stop playing it.
4537	0	a	First time login, having problem with register!  the UI sucks, how can i click that 'join now!' button if it's blocked by your ads???  Yes there is website, but this issue should be fixed for player's convenience
9116	1	a	well... this game is not as bad as it seems to be. and certainly this is not the worst free 2 play game you've ever faced
3194	1	a	This game is pretty cool for a realistic shooter.. doing crime is fun I haven't tried the Police yet.. its a bit too hard to shoot other players and I rarly played it enough for all the space it took on my pc so i uninstalled.. it was Enjoyable tho
4045	0	a	Fun for a while... then it gets horrible. Go play GTA online, its much better.
4602	0	a	Very bad experience wth this game: Launching this game messes up the whole steam client. Even after i close the game steam still shows it running in my status and everything else, now one would think as to restart the client to fix this but steam does not exit when a game is running, so it keeps requesting me to close the game first before exiting while it is already closed!(Also,you cannot launch the game again as it is already running according to steam)...sticky situation xD. then i have to use the task manager to manually terminate all steam processes and start steam again. Pretty tedious right? and this was just a single issue out of the many this game brings to the system. I could write about more issues but it would make this review too long, so in conclusion: very bad personal experince=would not recommend to anyone.
9581	1	a	worst game ever 10/10 would unistall again
10618	1	a	Tribes is back baby, after being left in the dust for two long years by HiRez... its back. Game is still as great as it was back in 2012, check this one out if you're at all interested in fps.
9824	1	a	I dont know it may be good i am gonna check it out
9603	0	a	Doesnt let you log in at all Reall confused
7451	0	a	A great Game!!! But not really much fun for Free to Play People. There are to much Bonuses for others. Not well balanced. But the Gameplay and Concept is a Plus to look at it closer. Free to play Titel 6/10.
6320	0	a	This game is really the reason why GTA exists. There\'s so many things wrong that I can I\'ll just list them:  Cons: 1. Game is very laggy. Comment: Even with a good computer, this game runs terrible. 2. Laggy servers. Comment: I have FANTASTIC internet and I always seem to lag as if I was using cafe wifi or something. 3. Not too many players. Comment: Wouldn\'t blame people who don\'t play this. The game is quite bad. 4. Boring side content. Comments: The character design and gun design while neat doesn\'t really seem to please me. 5. A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF DLC! Comment: What person wants to spend over $200 on some very lame DLC. The DLC doesn\'t even help.  Pros: NONE!  Final Thoughts: If you want a good open-world,multiplayer game. Get GTA 5! You could buy every GTA game with the money you spend on the DLC. RATING: 1/10 WITH A HORSHIT STAIN STAMP! &gt;:(
8437	0	a	Used to be alright, now it's â¥â¥â¥â¥
1115	1	a	The launcher crashes before it even begins. 9/11 Would relaunch again.
7906	0	a	This game is a disease  ...the uninstall button is the vaccine  1/10 would uninstall again
5594	0	a	It was unplayable because it would not load.
9978	1	a	Best MMO of 2015 10/10 would play again
7739	0	a	This game is really a piece of trash. I was expecting something like Grand Theft Auto Online, but this is something totally different - it's boring, it's weird, like when someone tries to make Saint's Row, but boring Saint's Row, without the giant â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and stuff. And MMO, of course. And one does not simply create a game like this. Don't download it, you'll be uninstalling it in a few hours, maybe minutes... perhaps seconds.  Overall: 0/10
10111	1	a	Great Game! Lots of story, gameplay, and awesome players who will help you out along the way! I wish there were a few more options to reduce lag though.
8140	0	a	I want to like this game. It has the potential to be fun. It's mechanics are great. The idea behind it amazing. But alas, it lacks the one thing any PVP game requires: Balance. It advertises a tutorial server that doesn't exist, so you're tossed into the thick of things to learn the game. It doesn't tell you controls, mission types, or anything of the sort, and the worst of it all is the utter lack of balance. A fresh off the boat character will be matched against gold level players wielding rocket launchers and LMG's that may as well be classified as ranged chainsaws. It's not newbie friendly at all, and it doesn't give you a chance to learn the game before putting you against people who live and breath the game. I can't recommend this, as much as I want to enjoy it.
5720	0	a	this game is not only pretty laggy also every vip guy who plays here they are impossible to beat them since they all have stronger weapons than non Vip people wich really makes me not even pay a cent to this game
2260	1	a	yes yes very good, a bit hard to know what to do in the beginning but sure test it out with friends
3385	1	a	don't know why so much people whine about unfair MM, learn to aim its not harder then that, i have played 65 hours and still stomping people who is lvl 255, can do it with the first weapon to, they just don' realise how to aim and learn it.. it takes like 10 hours to understand the recoil in the game..
2185	1	a	A good GTA like game that has a lot of customizations but it is multiplayer. A lot of missions and contacts that are fun to play with. But there are many hackers in the game which sucks. But it is really an awesome game after all. I will recommend this game to open-world gaming fans. :)
5269	0	a	Ok people this review is going to be quick.....This game is one of the best PAY TO WIN GAMES OUT THERE.
7175	0	a	I can't even play it -.-, Can someone help?
6553	0	a	please don t download it lol
7365	0	a	Gameplay is good, honestly. Lots of customization, etc. The real problem is the game is unplayable. It has seriously terrible lag spikes and makes the game is so hard to play with. Lots of players complained about this. If they fix the lag spikes, improve something heavy on the game or even make game changes, it maybe could be better.
4466	0	a	Now that GTAV is out on PC this game and its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs can finally die.
5185	0	a	This game is a piece of souless garbage. I rather stare a garbage can on a hot day then play this filth. Amen
5259	0	a	it's really puss like and would not recommend
10155	1	a	great rpg if you love fallout
3805	0	a	Gold players invade bronze servers to get their ranks up, not to mention at any time, you can go onto the store, buy the most OP weapon and use it forever and ever. Unplayable, unfair trash excuse of a game.
8267	0	a	because the car swallowed my memes so crie if u ned 2
1281	1	a	1. Steal a car 2. Crash the car into a shop window. 3. Rob the store and load the car. 4. Deliver stolen goods to black market dealer. 5. Repeat process.
3159	1	a	pay to win but is a really cool game
730	1	a	Ok dispite of the reviews i went ahead and dowloaded this game.... It is soooo much fun probally increibly boring without freinds i always played with freinds and it was so much fun the car meachnics are great the cutomisation is great the gunplay is great the missons are ok not bad but ok and it runs pretty smooth considering i only have a gt 630 graphics card an i6 prosesser and 4 gigs of ram :D
9546	1	a	I would have this game's babies
10716	1	a	i honestly dont understand why this game isnt more popular... its pretty amazing and the grind isnt as bad as people make it seem.
10737	1	a	After being essentially killed by the devs in 2012 it's on its way back. The multiple classes are gone with just light, medium, and heavy with different weapon options.  The skiing and jetpacks are some of the best things ever made in a game. I say at least give it a shot if you like fps games. But make sure you don't llama grab.
7631	0	a	I am very disappointed about this game, I was told this game had genitalia and it doesn't, shameful.
1423	1	a	Many people think I'm hacking , but I'm not . 11/Gentleman Sausage
10141	1	a	The game is good, but it's nothing new. The downloads are a little lengthy but hey what mmo dosent have lengthy downloads/updates. I would reccomend it because it took me away from WoW for awhile.
6971	0	a	This game kicked me from the server every time I joined one. I loved the look of this game but it won't even let me play it.
9263	0	a	another game just like Fallout..
6649	0	a	For the most part the game is fun if playing with the right people. For there are only two types of people one will find in this game. Over powered and skilled players and a person who is going to play for a week and rage out. This game is usually fun for about a half hour before it dawns upon players that it is one of the buggiest almost dead free to play games in the market. In the end even though the game has one of the most interesting and advance character/vehicle customization beyond that it is lacking in every field and leave much if not all to be desired.
9598	0	a	Its fun if you like ammo crafting simulators.
8505	0	a	Pay 2 win game, better save the money and buy GTA V.
8785	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
1009	1	a	this is in a way a online grand theft game... but i like it more you get to drive cars/kill people steal and other fun â¥â¥â¥â¥. in a way its pay to win but you can win with out ingame â¥â¥â¥â¥ :P
9451	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.  I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.  The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.  All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.  
8498	0	a	Game was awesome, too bad it WAS... That was one of the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played, too bad this game is stucked at beta and its release date - 2011y... I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money... I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING A SINGLE BUCK ON THIS CRAP, SO DEVS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOING TO LOSE ALL THE PLAYERS, AND I PERSONALLY HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN 1 DAY! Sorry if my review contain mistakes, nobody is perfect, but the game IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. -8/10
10804	1	a	Very cool, everything is perfect, but had a problem creating account, now everything works 
10	1	a	Ahh an honest review?Huh,that can be kinda hard but lets see: 1.Amazing Customization Features 2.Fast paced gameplay(unless you are camping with a sniper like a total idiot) 3.EXTREMELY long-like to unlock everything in a game is a gamer's worst nightmare,but here...well.. you can have a solid 1000 hours and still don't have every unlockable item for your faction,not even gonna talk about maxing both factions. 4.EXPLOSIONS 5.Gamersfirst(the company that made the game)recently changed their office from England to the USA and they are planning to recruit a lot more people and 2017 we are expecting a new engine from Tiggs.Here is a video:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded engine upgrade render test (in-game capture)&nbsp;
701	1	a	Better than GTA!!!
5267	0	a	22.07.14. New update with new-uber-anticheat system. And once cheater with aimbot and macro on OBEYA CR-762 in the first match after update &gt;_&lt;. GamersFirst - suÑks!  APB Reloaded. R.I.P. 2011-2014.
3912	0	a	Extremely P2P, virtually impossible to keep your gear, unless you pay ofcourse
10112	1	a	Seems like a good game, controls are a bit complicated or you can say different. But great amount of customization and huge map with a fair amount of playerbase. I would recommend this for people who don't really play alot of shooters and can easily accept the controls and complexness of the game.
1138	1	a	This is ta best game ever ! i love him &lt;3
10530	1	a	I first played Tribes: Ascend 3 or 4 years ago on its official site I got hooked to it pretty fast and it even became one of those games that you could play and forget a little thing called the time. The game is really fast paced for those of you that have not played it reccomend that if you are the type of gamer that can lose there temper very easily on an online game and you like to blame it on lag then this would not be the game for you simply cause most of the players Have mastered the tragectory system meaning that they could probably predict where you are going to land or where you are going to run or ski off to and shoot a grenade at your feet from across the map. Now when i stopped playing this game my old computer fryed itself and i nearly got completly got engrossed in consol games and had completly forgot about tribes until a few days ago but could not remember the name at all until a friend that played it before said it was on steam. Now while i was downloading this i thought my preowned Toshiba laptop that i got for less than Â£200 wont be likley to handle this at all well tribes proved me wrong it has never lagged on me at all so far and i find that outstanding considering that TF2 lags all the time until ive been on the server for a few minutes. I feel that its unfortunate that the communilty of tribes ascend has remained so small cause if it got pretty big we would be looking at one of the biggest free to play fps games competing alongside tf2 which wasnt even originally free and many more. Ive noticed that they have only updated a couple of times since they brought the game out to the online comunity and ive also seen people question or speculate on it but i say where did they need to improve. Now i noticed that they reduced the blast radius and damage of explosives and I would suggest a tribe customization and that would represent the players clan. But please HiRez Studios if any of you read this review please only take the suggestion if there is a boost on players in the steam and web community. I cant really think of anything bad about this game other than the auto balance system for teams i often find myself killing allot in one game then getting killed all the time in the next match I feel that this might be the only thing that could be driving people away from this game.
7211	0	a	Stupid game with no real excitement
644	1	a	Really fun for a free game.
10413	0	a	Can't update with a 12mb/s. Very afraid about this, i play this game few years ago and it was a good game..
3858	0	a	if the developers would put as much time into the actualy gameplay mechanics as they do customization then this game would be one of the best.  poor/ immature comunity third person shooter level 1 newbies need to fight max level players or in other words you can be killed in one hit and you need to shoot others 10 times. bad driving mechanics very little to do  let this game die and take it off steam. i have no interest in this game unless they remove or ratify the above problems
1614	1	a	Played it, died over 50 times. 9/11
2264	1	a	OK Game. The graphics are alright, and you have a fun experience.
7443	0	a	Wouldn't let me play had to create an account on a third party site.
6260	0	a	i do not recommend this game its a terrible game the controls are all wonky and half of the games controls dont work super buggy game do not download this game
2084	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing owns
3992	0	a	I was once inlove with this game,but now i'm dissapointed  this game started became â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every patch, hacker everywhere,the game is laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can't believe i throw into this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. R.I.P APB RELOADED it was fun while it last. If you're ready to get your asskick and kill by hacker with no recoil shooting or 1 hit kill then be my guest go play this game. good luck. My final verdict for this game is 1/10.
3953	0	a	Bah, I played this, Got really good with my arrests, and was banned because I got reported to many times for using the LTL weapons all the time. Arrests get you the most money and points, and they are pretty easy to use, But you will get banned for using them as you primary all the time in Fight Club, Shame, I spent a pretty penny on this game as well, I was a Closed beta tester, I fell in love with the customizations and the idea this game was going for.
6847	0	a	This game is extremly unbalanced. When ever you start a mission against someone there is no ranking system, it's only randomized where you and your friends that are new to the game fight agains players that have spent hours and cash on this game. And even after a while when you have played the game the other players have to strong weapons and vehicals for you to even do anything.  With that said  -Unbalanced -Pay to win  
10126	1	a	WHY IT FREEZZZEEEZ FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE if I enter to a romm in the tutorial?
2141	1	a	This game is fun... If you have friends to play it with! Very few things I can say about it... theres honestly not that much to it.  *Logs In* *Sees Friend* *Watches friend get ran over*   Thats pretty much the game.    10/10 Would watch friend die again.
9249	0	a	Just play Fallout 3 instead.
4718	0	a	2 hrs loading .. WTF!!!
10215	1	a	Great game I really like games of this kind and I convinced all my friends to download this game, and they really liked this game!
4078	0	a	The game of great promises, greater disappointment and epic development fail. The game that's supposed to be every little boy's cops-n-robbers dream come true. However because of poor managment not only did it sink the company behind it, but even under the wings of a new owner people connected with the development process, being it developers or community managers, either got fired a few times or quit on their own.  The game is extremly newbie unfriendly, the weapon/shooting/engagement mechanics are so weird that the experience gained in other FPS/TPS games doesn't carry well into this one. There's a tutorial (finally, after being worked on for about 1,5 year or so), but it doesn't teach you anything that will help you to survive against hardened old timers of San Paro, because let's face it - the only people left still playing this game are the ever so bitter die-hards, that are so addicted, they won't let go. Be advised, you'll be facing them often, and when you do, they'll pull every dirty trick in the book, do anything and everything in their power to make your stay in San Paro as miserable and frustrating as they are.  So is this game this bad? That's a trick question. There's this really nice matchmaker feature that should match you up against people of simmilar skill level. It should, but currently the population pool is so low that the matchmaker has some real proplems finding the right people, so don't be surprised if a lot, if not most, of your missions are extremely one-sided. And most often you'll be on the wrong side.  APB is also the only game I ever played in which just driving around the map during the mission and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off your opponents can be way more fun than actually playing the game like it was meant.  It's also the only game that ups its hardware requirements bit by bit with each patch. I remember the times when I could record the game in 60FPS, 800x500, while running the game in 60FPS HD with highest detail settings and antialiasing. I don't know what went wrong, but the last time I ran it, I could barely get 45FPS on medium settings.  The greatest power of this game is that it's one of a kind, there's really no other like it. All the shooting and driving, and shooting while driving, car chases, skirmishes, sudden twists... all of this is great fun... until you get screwed either by being matched against a group of four teamspeaking clannies that will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you silly, or just the game itself, like: â¢ being spawned 150m from the objective while the opposing team spawns right next to it, â¢ being spawned in some sh!thole where the civilization suddenly died and noone owned a car, with the closest car spawner farther than the objective itself, â¢ the objective spawning in a place thats nearly impossible to storm when properly defended, ofcourse with the enemy already guarding it â¢ general respawn mechanics - missions get won or lost because of it. â¢ weird camera workings, which results in your toon often obstructing whatever you're aiming at, â¢ bugs that remain unfixed to this day, â¢ so you just switched to your sniper rifle? Nice, but now the fight moved to a close quartes area, take your precious mission time and switch again; you did? Great, but we could use a sniper now... ... I could go on like this. There are just so many gameflow breaking faults of random annoyance that at some point you're so fed up with the game that you quit... only to go back two weeks later to have a lot of fun and then suddenly being reminded what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you so much in this game, and you quit again... this love-hate relationship may go on for a while, but at some point you grow the maturity to finally quit, uninstall and never look back.  Currently the game dies little by little with the population systematically shrinking each month. There's a (supposedly) big update coming up (that's been delayed 2 years already) which will replace the dated, old, heavily customized Unread Engine with a 'factory issue' Unreal 3 engine (if I remember correctly). A lot of people bound great hopes with this event, however, as devs stated, the new engine will bring a bit better graphics and will allow to bring more content to the game a lot easier and faster. By more content I understand probably more guns, cars and clothing which will be sold thru ARMAS - the ingame cash shop. IMHO APB doesn't need more content, as it won't fix the game's fundamental issues, frustrating gameflow breakers and dangling pieces of gameplay mechanics that Real Time Worlds never managed to properly implement.  Update: G1 rolled an event that was actually worth playing so I decided to reinstall. After three hours I can clearly tell that the cheating is out of hand. Each mission in which I participated had at least one gold-threat low-rating player (which indicates a freshly created account) in both teams, running around in newbie clothes kicking everyone's â¥â¥â¥ sky high. Go figure. Plus, old bugs, like the scoreboard bug (players from previous missions in current mission scoreboard, so you can't tell who're you up against) still not fixed. There's just absolutely no fun left in this game what so ever. No engine update is gonna save this burning trainwreck.
10397	1	a	love this game, couldn't stop playing it at all. I loved all those missions that contained collecting stuff or killing enimies, even delivering stuff to another city which took fuel or food, (if you were on a horse). really love the leveling up system, nut what I really didn't like (that was the only thing) which was the auction house. The aution house was all about players that would pay to get their chips (the currency of the game) which was a whole lot for like a stupid item that everybody had already, and even the crafting material was expensive in the aution hause, but like I said that was the only thing that bothered me. Everybody should get this game so that we can all play together.
6888	0	a	free to play but totally pay to win
9876	1	a	So far It's quite very nice. Had fun playing it
9081	1	a	This game has been out for a while, and, compared to other currently active MMOs, Fallen Earth does fairly well.  If you like the post-apocalpytic theme, crafting a variety of items, shooter action-rpgs, and playing with others, you should enjoy this one.  The aesthetics are pretty good, the equip-able armor and weapons are all visible on your character. The music and sounds are decent.   The controls are easy to familiarize yourself and, like most MMOs, the beginning tutorial is extremely helpful in establishing your bearings in the game world. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs and their mechanics.  Crafting is a very fun part of this game if you are into that - you can craft almost anything you see in the game world (which beats having to spend your resources on merchants. Within the first 2 hours I already was driving around in my own ATV. The gameplay is pretty good, however, it still remains fairly buggy in many areas. The AI has godlike sensors, able to detect and chase you across the map once you have aggro'd (hostile interaction) them.   Grinding in this game is actually pretty fun considering that the rewards are very reasonable and the variety in missions is very, very good - they aren't 90% fetch or find quests typical of many MMORPGs. Combat can be weird and clunky at times, and hopefully this will be improved, however, it has been a long time and these problems still remain.  If you can look past these bugs, and enjoy grinding and crafting in the post-apocalyptic setting, then give this game a try.   Recommend.
810	1	a	DUCK THE POLICE (Ja DUCK the police deal with it)
8100	0	a	Don't touch this game unless you have friends (AND U GUYS PRBLY DONT LOL). It's completely and utterly garbage without it. No but seriously, this game is an utter mess, it's good fun with your friends but otherwise you deal with a toxic community, a questionable company and so many hackers that the braindead community can't distinguish between the real ones and players that just play a lot.
10236	1	a	Like a less fun version of fallout but its free!
5168	0	a	WORST COMPANY EVER..... the game was great but not anymore.
9142	0	a	If you usually rebind game controls in order to play things... have fun with this.
6037	0	a	Its a realy good game but has a real problem winth lag and i thing i am not the only person who has this problem
2258	1	a	It's pretty good but the amount of hackers is really disheartening.
1179	1	a	APB was a bad game to me at first, but then i started to play more hoping it would get better. And It did, the game (in my opinion) is not P2W i have bought single gun, and do better then most of the people i play against. So in overal, the game is really fun, besides the fact that missions are repetitive. The graphics are pretty nice, and really fun if you play with friends Via Skype. So download the game and message me if you want to play together :)
6185	0	a	Game has become pure pay 2 win, years after release there are still a number of issues with the game with lag within the game, hit detection being completely off, glitches in mission scripts causing one sided games.
4929	0	a	It sucks.
10644	1	a	Prepare for halo type fighting while skiing
4159	0	a	This game will steal your soul, i do NOT recommend.
8815	0	a	I cant even get the game to load! the launcher has MANY, MANY problems that need fixing. even when I can get past the launcher the game wont load, so I dont really have any oppinion towards the game/gameplay but this game need alot of help. I also asked a friend how he got the game to work because i saw him playing it, but he replied with 'I havent even gotten it to work, ive just been stuck in the launcher trying to fix it'
5410	0	a	Unique game and playstyle, weapons are great, systems and everything about this game is amazing in it's own right, including the asylum and baylift, especially the clothes, vehicle, character, etc customization. Although many problems do exist with this game such as including the matchmaking system. One other problem although I know of this game is that steam registers it as open even when it has been fully closed for hours, unallowing you to close steam without the task manager. All in all though it is a great game besides some capatability bugs with steam. You got glitched galore in the maps and everywhere else. This game when you look for problems, you find them. You have kids with rocket launchers surfing card and firing away at you. Missions are onesided and heres the big one.....ANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN A GARBAGE TRUCK CAN RUN OVER YOUR CAR, CARS AROUND YOU AND EVERYTHIGN ELSE RAMMING IT AND DESTROYING IT ALL OUTSIDE OF ANY MISSION SO YOU CAN NOT HARD THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.....and it's quite annoying I do say.... also you need 400+ hours in the game to even have a chance at taking on veteran players who log hours. combat is screwed up with hit registers due to when you shoot depends on when the server is pinging, everything having a small noticable delay

2662	1	a	i cant log in to my steam account
7957	0	a	This game had amazing character customization. purely amazing, the details for styling, and creating your own personal look, is something other games need, BUT, and it is a big but, like on madea. THE GAME SUCKS. the first 30 minutes are pretty entertaining, but after that, it is just a completley horrid experience. shame too. as i said, the customization was nearly perfect. i give it 1/10....no joke 
2734	1	a	Great fun free to play cops vs robbers TPS. Battling out with up to 50vs50, can get very intense!
8732	0	a	i use to think this was alright, but now i cant even load up the game

10400	0	a	It has all the classic elements of a crappy RPG like:   a hassle-filled control scheme  A boring overused plot  forcing you to sign up for their spam emails just to play  cookie-cutter character foils  Poor voice acting  Even worse sound effects (as in literally 0 noise, even when using a machine gun)   enemies who respawn way too fast (as in right after you already kill them)  and a story that goes absolutely nowhere.  2/10 Better off on Runescape m8

5580	0	a	This game is the worst game ever created. I don't know why anyone plays it anymore. It has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics which makes the characters looks and feel like sims characters. The shooting on the game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dreadful that I'd rather play call of duty and don't mention the driving which is worse than crazy taxi physics. It's guns are really bad, and to get a decent weapon wouldn't you know... You have to pay, and it's on a loan most of the time so you gotta pay every week or so. Why would anyone play this game? I don't know... Maybe to get ebola or some â¥â¥â¥â¥. Please just think about playing Runescape or Super mario or nothing infact. Before you pick this toxic aids up.
8924	1	a	For a Free Game, this game rocks! In 2 days I have already put 20 hours into the game. This game has so much to do, and so much is going on, that you are spoiled with missions and activities! If you're looking for an RPG in the Post-Apocoliptic era, or you just wanna play a game similar looking to Fallout, than this is a game I highly recommend downloading, whats even better is if you don't like it you're not losing anything because its FREE, and I am surprised it is after how much fun this game is. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a good game and have fun with other players. This game has most pieces to an RPG game such as Clans, Events, Tons of Weapon, Armour, and Clothes! It also has skills you level up after getting AP Points, which yout hen use to upgrade your skills. The crafting system is also nice, and you can basically craft almost anything.   (PS if you're trying to download this game and you think the Update downloader is stuck, its not. I also thought mine was stuck and after looking up how to fix it I found no solution when turns out I just wasn't being patient. I started the downloader and left it on over night and it was finished by morning! Hopefully that helps any of you that have that 'problem'.)
5815	0	a	Need to take a break from this game....   before it eats me alive.
3152	1	a	Improved from original, people are actually playing it. Fun, however this game is a major â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ magnet. Play, don't give a damn, and you'll have a blast. Outside of the lag spikes on both east and west coast servers...a worthwhile venture into MMO 'Cops &amp; Robbers'..
3856	0	a	Game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. Toxic as hell community. Players hack. People try to ruin your fun. Teamates team kill cuz you're better than them. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ waste of a game.
126	1	a	It is not impossible to do well in this game without paying real $$, it is however very difficult. The only reason this game has not faded into obscurity is because it has a great customization suite that allows for your characters to truly be unique. The mechanics and gunplay are addicting but the issues with a competitive 3rd person perspective will occasionally leave you frustrated. GamersFirst really needs to reevaluate its monetization policy and look at maybe moving away from pay to win. Depending on the server you play on, script kiddies will be an issue, the game is 'free to play' which means you have people creating new accounts as soon as they get banned. Overall the game has its issues but for me its redeeming qualities outshine its issues. With all that said, this game is definitely not for everyone, but as it is free to play I recommend that everyone tries it out, this game could use a larger population. I have about 2000 hrs total playtime (before steam integration) and I can firmly say that its potential is being squandered by GamersFirst. IF changes come about, I could realistically see this game become a huge hit for more than the small number of people who play it nowadays.
333	1	a	It's nice game!
522	1	a	10/10 To much time wasted on here to invest in something productive, like taking a â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10061	1	a	played this game for years now the devs never give new content or fix old bugs pure lazy dev team but for a frre to play game its one of best out there just dont hit max level to fast or bordom will follow

10154	1	a	Fallen Earth. This game could be so much more than it is, and it is a lot. It is sad that development has fallen to a snail's pace. This game features one of the best crafting systems in an MMO, where almost everything has to be crafted and can be crafted by you. Since it has gone F2P, it has not been relegated to a P2W game, just P4C.
9934	1	a	this game is awsome not like any mmorpg but its more fps and that make it awsome
1652	1	a	I have been playing this game ever since early 2011, and still to this day the events are epic and the updates are frequent. The game used to be owned by RealTime Worlds but then was bought by Gamersfirst, ever since then the games performance was dropped significantly. The servers are more unstable, they crash a half a dozen times weekly, and recently while I was online the servers completely froze for a good half a minute. The chat was flooding with complaints from players but it was pretty funny if you ask me. Hackers are uncommon on this game which is good.  A few of the reasons why I still continue to put up with this game is because of the player freedom and community. The character customization is very complex. For example, there are like 4 different customization sliders just for your characters nose. The clothing and character customization is so vast that I have seen players in-game dressed as Ronald Mc'Donald, The Joker, Harly Quinn, celebreties such as Justin Bieber, Tupac, Will Smith, Bill O'Reilly, Obama, Chuck Testa, Youtubers, and many more.  The vehicle customization is also huge and with certain vehicle modifications, such as Nitro 3, you can do stunts and jumps in a district and impress some people.   The game is very unique as far as the character customization and free roam aspect. I'd give it a 7.5/10 due to the servers preformance and the fact that many people get falsely banned quite frequently due to 3rd party programs when they never even did anything wrong. I'v lost friends that have just one day disapeared from this happening to them, it's depressing that the G1 staff don't help at all when it comes to unbanning. If you get banned on this game permanently for any reason at all, don't expect on getting it unbanned.
2055	1	a	Really fun to play with a group of friends! Great Customization! Sh*tty servers???? Lots of hackers??? Haven't seen many hackers but the server thing is kinda is sorta definitely true :L But still fun!
6805	0	a	Are you ready to get blown to bits by people with rocket launchersa and never do anything productive? Then this is the game for you!
8356	0	a	cuz the â¥â¥â¥â¥ wont play cuz i dont have the right graphics card so yea peace of shir steam ur a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shity gaaming think i made i wait three hours for the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to download then it wont â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play so im gald it was free cuz i would br getting my money back
2319	1	a	This is a good game.
6568	0	a	Too many problems to have much fun with. Just avoid
1357	1	a	Just love the customizations for the outfits and cars other whis more games had this type of system
8989	1	a	I found lag to be the greatest downer.  Other than that the environment is fully immersive and the storyline extensive; though familiar. You can stay on point and do quests, or venture off and level up in the desert on your own; to a certain degree, in that you'll have to sell loot eventually. After crafting two lawnmower blades into dual-weild weapons I had the most fun.  NOTE:I live in the area it is set in and they got our night sky, the star constellations, right. That's one heck of a detail.
971	1	a	After 9 months without my pc, when I finally got my pc back I started with this game and I realized it that I still â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game!!!! I have faith in you G1 please keep the game alive somehow :D
757	1	a	This is what GTA 5 would be if it were always online and even more violent as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
2832	1	a	10/10 This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome. Just like GTA except far more indepth with charactacter and vehical customization. Its massively multiplayer and best of all ... Its free. Only one down side is the Australian server has not been released yet, but I will be patient.
1242	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.

737	1	a	It ril ged 
1338	1	a	Really good free to play game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ amount of customization and great community if you join a decent clan, fair warning quite a few hackers
4459	0	a	It crashed my driver and graphic card and it broke gg would spend $500 agian
2301	1	a	Something about this game makes me feel like I am worse at it now than I was when I first started playing APB. But all in all it's good fun and just roaming around in cool rides( or crashing into every single obstalce) and getting dragged into missions makes it a 8/10 game.
4833	0	a	The game is so buggy it says i am playin APB but i dont play it :( plz fix it
2505	1	a	Although it has some faults overall I think its agreat game with alot of potential.The customization is absolutely awesome,and so is the expeience you'll have playing.Sometimes it can get laggy but not often,oh and the match making system is questionable at times. If you like GTA then this is deff for you.
9039	1	a	Yep, you read it, 1879 hours!  Well, I used to like this game because I could grind and talk to friends at the same time, take over territories, and engage in awesome shootouts (PvP) with up to 20 players or more.  I really got the feeling that I was part of a team and that some people were real helpful with noobs (mainly because of the clan aspect). I had a lot of fun playing this and there are a lot of missions and content. In fact, I am still only 33% of the way through completing the achievements, albiet some of them are unobtainable now.  When the devs were active, they would appear in-game all the time to give away items and be helpful. This was great! Sometimes they would use 'god powers' to be invisible and watch us play new areas that just got released, then make private messages 'I see you!'. - HAH That's great! I met a couple devs that would recognize me and start chatting; even added me to their steam friends list. Pretty cool!  The best experience was on Halloween 3 years in a row where the devs would come out and give away treats (bling for your character). The first year, a dev transformed himself into a giant 4 story tall beast and he ATE ME! HAHAHAHahhaa So the next two years I stood in the mass crowd of online players and typed 'Turn into the beast again!' and sure enough he did, and he ate me again, and everyone started clattering their keyboards to respond. SO GREAT!  But yeah,.. it's just a ghost town now... If more people played, the devs would care again, and this game would once again bring me joy (bugs and all).
4332	0	a	You will play the game.. You will encounter many Hackers... You will rage your little heart out.. But in the end... You will always have a craving to play the damn game..  EDIT: Just kidding.. You will hate everyone.
1163	1	a	Best Online Game Ever. If you like GTA series, then you would like this game too.
572	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâs new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010âs deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâs devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâs missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâs problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
6939	0	a	This game is poopoo
6967	0	a	it cant even load
8757	0	a	Played this to pass time until i got gta v now i can finally be happy
4048	0	a	this game is imbalanced if you are free to play. the match making makes no sense, new players getting placed against players with rocket launchers (advanced weapons).  Rocket Launchers take away from the whole 'cop vs Criminal' aspect of the game. i tried to get into this game multiple times with friends. each time we got turned off when we were placed against players who had better guns/equipment against us.  never understood this method of FTP, it is designed to discourage playing the game free. but in the end all it did was discourage me from investing in it.
4431	0	a	Got banned out of nowhere.... Contacted dev's got a bs copy and paste email.  Got with a real person. and they told me why I got banned. and that was it  they said I was hacking but when I asked what I was doing and what proof they had they ignored me.   Pros -  Awesome game   Cons - Pay2Play Random Bans from mods who dont like you.
4464	0	a	Dont play dis
5303	0	a	this game used to be fun but now its a game of lag and itiots
3817	0	a	Alone: 3/10 With friends: 7/10  Dont bother playing alone.   Grouping system sucks and the community is poor.
5900	0	a	I remember playing this game when it first came out. Didn't like it then because the controls were a pain in the â¥â¥â¥, couldn't summon my vehicle, couldn't remove items from my locker and place them in my inventory. EVEN IN AN AMMO ZONE!  Thought hey I'll quit playing this pos and take my clan with me and MAYBE, just MAYBE when when we come back, the developers will have fixed the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t controls. Nope.  Developers still haven't developed a temporary spawn for players spawning in on either team. Still have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ campers they immediatly put you in a crossfire or run your over almost immediatly as you spawn back in.  All in all. This game is still extremely poorly balanced apparently will never be fixed, even with the Pay-2-Win gamers it attracts. I miss the this game, but it isn't worth the time or effort.
2160	1	a	Its a game of anger
3414	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA
183	1	a	This game while being very entertaining to play with friends, it is better if you do. The servers are near empty almost 24/7 and the only people left are people who have EVERYTHING. If you intend to play this, get a squad of friends.
9399	1	a	it is amazing never played it  
3124	1	a	Launcher has lots of errors
7536	0	a	It is a complete P2W game. 2 shotgun shells on the enemy can't kill him/her, and a few bullets, probably 3-4 from a rifle killed me. Turns out the enemy is a cash player and had a lot of attachments on his/her guns, and is also able to destroy a car in a few bullets.  Close to none PvE in the game, with almost no choice of weapons until a few weeks ago, which set you with only 2 permanent guns to choose from, which one of them is the default rifle.  Overall, unless you love getting owned by P2W players and was ok with being randomly teamed against players obviously stronger than you, it's a good game.
842	1	a	THE BEST AROUUUNNNDDD (:
1732	1	a	It's fun. So much. But it sucks, i told you.
773	1	a	one of the best games i have played  
3357	1	a	I'm Commisioner Gordon by day, and the Black Mask by night.  7/10  Would cruise in Police Car to 'In the Air toinght' By Phil Collins again.  Would not get kicked off team before xp gain for 3rd time though.
9890	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥
7215	0	a	i hate this stupid game i got 6 accounts banned with 5.000$ wasted on them. dont try to play this game and gamersfirst is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all they do is just steal money and bann yourr acc. I recommend you guys not to get it and btw i have never hack in my apb account in none of them and boom! This account has been blocked (10008) I LOST 6 ACCOUNT because of this â¥â¥â¥â¥tards they make allot of money because of their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
7687	0	a	Now I can see that this game definitely had a lot of potential in the beginning, but the end product is a broken mess that is confusing, tedious, and repetitive. The major upside of this game is that the character customization is far superior to many other games. Other than that, there's hardly anything worth mentioning about this game. My advice: Don't waste your time, and certainly DON'T waste your money on this game.
8578	0	a	meh... free pvp gta V with bad graphics and limited time weapons
7216	0	a	This game is CRAP seriously i wasted 1090 hours on bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ the missons are the same , people are actually hacking , fairfight banning random people for being good and PAY TO FU=KING WIN is bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ its more like pay to lose and get banned
1135	1	a	I think its a little bit like arma 3 altis life... Just my thaughts of the game...
3820	0	a	This game is full of the most saltiest individualds I've ever met, it takes Call of Duties community and makes it look like a saint.    as of 3/8/16 nothings changed except the game seems to be more dead AKA still sucks â¥â¥â¥
7709	0	a	Be all you can't be, in this game everyone wants to be a hacker.
7335	0	a	On this game, you get to customize your character the way YOU want to, maybe not to specific but yo can get damn close, plus the Action in it is fun, just try and avoid the cheaters when possible  ***NEW NOTE*** over the years playing it now, i lost all taste in the game, its rather bad and just plain garbage, i regret spending money on this now other than to just customize my characters.
1664	1	a	Don't hate the player, Don't hate the game, Hate the troop man, we take all blame. That you got no money, you got no fame, That you got no honeys, you got no name.  (atleast try it, you wont survive more than a day without your wallet)
2026	1	a	i love this game
9789	0	a	THE WORST MMO I'VE EVERY PLAYED! I wanted to kill myself like the samurai did in japan....... 80 minutes I'll never get back D:
636	1	a	it's ok
6184	0	a	heres a story:  APB Reloaded dated fallout. They kissed and fallout gave APB game crash sickness and there is no cure. APB cant stop crashing thanks to fallout.  10/10  would break keyboard over chrash again
8291	0	a	  It seems like a good game but i can't play it because the servers are amazingly bad. Unplayable.
8791	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
265	1	a	Very good game and EPIC!!!
7603	0	a	It's free but it barely works. World is dreadfully boring to look at. The menus are messy. It was a good idea that was made horribly.
4591	0	a	10/10 would waste my life again on this loser company money grabbing gridy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10482	1	a	This is a sandbox game of sorts with the elements of games such as DayZ,Fallout and Rust.However,since it lacks the visual beauty of DayZ and the back story of games such as Nether and Fallout,it is not quite as popular as one might hope. The game still requires some tweeks here and there but with patience and some tlc,this game has extreme potential. The depth of crafting and exploring is truly unique along with the optional co-operation of other players. It's been quite awhile since I last played this game but I believe it deserves a second chance from those who shun it due to graphics and any slight game play bugs. All in all?Give it a chance.
4117	0	a	This game is working with the worst original Anti-Cheat system for online multiplayer games of the year.
7051	0	a	Probably favorite game of all time but since I have posted a dozen times on forums on Steam, Gamersfirst and APB website, and have gotten little to no help with figuring out a bug that wont launch the game. I am not recommending. Very salty.
4975	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
3130	1	a	2/10  - Interesting gameplay - Imba cash shop - Cash sink
3106	1	a	Cops and Robbers, the MMO. The price is certainly right and like TF2 you can have a fun time without spending a dime. The customization is pretty amazing and shows just how much time went into making this game; making it's lack of initial success back in 2010 all the more sad. You can play in a group or on your own, it's all good.
7538	0	a	it wont let me luanch apb i press start then it wont load
889	1	a	pretty good game enjoy playing.
9383	0	a	it was more like fallen earth pay2play. no. not pay2win. pay2play. ridiculouse. this is the third bad review i have ever given a game. seems like it woulda been good. but it isent 
4596	0	a	ONLY PLAY THIS GAME IF U ARE PREPARED FOR PAY TO WIN
2352	1	a	I am so addicted to this game. If I could afford to, I would skip work to play this all night tonight and all day tomorrow. Simply amazing!
2588	1	a	Great game, alot of customizing, alot of options, over-all entertaining and nice gameplay.
590	1	a	APB has tons of ways to customize and you can choose between being an enforcer or a criminal.
5793	0	a	This f*cking game, it almost gave me an aneurism. It is so terrible, as my friend Jack mentioned you either fork out $30 for a gun that isn't very good, or grind for weeks for a sh*tty cosmetic item such as shoes. The optimization is awful, the community is a bunch of 12 year olds, cars handle like there's no gravity, and the interface doesen't even work and/or is confusing as sh*t. Hackers everywhere and glitchers constantly killing you. Even with the poor anticheat if there even is one. This game is truly, one of the absolute WORST programs I have ever had on my hard drive. And who the hell sells a $100 DLC that has very little to offer??? Dafuq?  1/10.
7773	0	a	i was playing a hour early and i went to get food i come back on and it sayed i was banned for no reason i did nothing to get this no hack not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ player off so how do i get banned for nothing and it is now one hour later gamerfirst i will not get any more of your games
1453	1	a	Pretty good only the graphics really takes space even though its yeahno quality graphics i do reccomend this game
10778	1	a	TRIBES: Ascend, is a Free-To-Play title that is very much worth your time, sliding across the battlefield with kickass weapons makes for a fun &amp; awesome game, there is a microtransaction, but it is VERY avoidable since you earn in game revenue moderately well, the graphics are a 8/10 with the almighty UNREAL Engine in place, i wish there were more maps, but its great just the way it is, this is in 2nd place up to Team Fortress 2, the best way to play it in my opinion, is to play DragonForce while enjoying this 9.3/10 Game. THUMBS UP TO Hi-Rez Studios!
104	1	a	What I love about this game is that it is much more of out smarting your opponent than having a better gun. Even though sometimes guns can be over powered, most are balanced but easily better in certain situations. But with the proper team anything can be done. This game has it's glitches though and lag but nothing game breaking in my opinion. And hey it's free. If you do put money into it though it will reward your experience.  But the gameplay isn't the only thing that makes APB special. The customization is almost limitless. I've made several characters from movies (Batman, Iron Man, Captain America, Punisher, Superman etc.) and it's a lot of fun in my opinion. The customization is way beyond most games period. If not the best.  People are trying to fix some of the problems in the game as well. We'll be due for a new engine update soon, so hopefully that will fix most of the issues.  All in all this is my all time favorite MMO. Will you like it? I have no idea, but you should try it!
1893	1	a	Has more crying kids then Call of Duty eventhough is has less players 10/10
8158	0	a	game needs balance. ex) every bronze sever in high levelers. the goldgun code is spread. aim haker in game.  and sever is insecurity. ex) sever shutdown without notice to steam users. asia users only have high ping(150ms+).  
5744	0	a	spent all my time playing in a laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ character creator that didnt even change some aspects of the character even when i was supposedly changing them, just to sit at a forever 'Connecting to District Server...' screen.  no, its not my end that is faulty. i have high end hardware(not some junky poor man's piece), win7 ultimate 64bit(its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 2015, no reason to have 32bit unless its for softwar specific needs, which is what compatibility mode is for.... so still no reason for 32bit), high end internet in a suburb area(not junky comcast out in the middle of nowhere), and all gigabit/cat6 networking. Perfect connection to other US servers (and a few EU and JP servers), but not this one. I cant even properly review this game, because i cant even get it to work.
7397	0	a	This game is allright, you know fun to play with a group of friends (not so much solo) but thats down to your own play style, this game is obviously still updating and getting better and better but most people wont enjoy this game for many reasons  - Hackers (they still exist in the game and there isn't anything really being done to get rid of them, even punkbuster is doing a â¥â¥â¥â¥ job) and when the hacker eventually gets banned a new one is born, so it's a never ending cycle and I mean if you always get put against a hacker, yes you can be lucky and own a hacker since most hackers are complete and utter idiots so it's easy but most of the time it's just dam impossible to play the game when there are â¥â¥â¥ bugs like this running around using wallhack, aimbot etc etc.  - Lag - This is still an issue today server lag is too dam high and it's annyoing kind of spoils the game really when people or yourself are warping around like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ so it can be frustrating, there is talk about them upgrading their servers at somepoint but even then I don't think it will be any time soon we have nice running smooth servers, it's a pile of wank  - Glitch spots - you have the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game that like to exploit the games princibles by putting the item in a stupid to get location or an OP spot, this too is a game spoiler as it ruins the fun when the ennemy oposition are just camping like little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es, this gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying and pisses me off, so it eventually turns you bronze. It's stupid and G1 need to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing do something about these stupid locations  There are many other reasons why this game is total crap, but the game also have good parts, fun to play etc but it does get boring eventually and hackers/lameidiots just makes the game boring.  GamersFirst make enough money from Armas Marketplace yet they just don't do anything good about it, rather than fixing the easy, obvious to fix issues they'd rather create more crap to put on the marketplace for people to buy, fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game already but yea, I don't recomment this game especially since you have to start from the bottom and work up, with idiots on this game your just going to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on.
9524	1	a	great game
4381	0	a	Dont get this. It seems like GTA online but its really not. If you are not willing to pay money you are going to die alot.
5430	0	a	kinnda like gta but with more customization
6633	0	a	Everytime I ever tried to play, it kicked me. Super.
9176	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I tried to do a mission and it said to make bullets i had the materials but I couldnt craft it.It turns out you have to find teh blue print this quest is one the of the beggining ones.
3442	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
8303	0	a	Not a good game... after waiting and waiting for it to download it didn't work... it asked me to download it again from THEIR website... â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ download, free to play equivalent of GTA :(
3268	1	a	Now i dont really like many MMO's but this... is just AMAZING I just wish they would kinda stop thy lagg, if they havent really.
4127	0	a	0/10 Server sucks engine suck gameplay suck everything sucks The freedom in character design is good though
5558	0	a	This game dont have newbie server . . so newbie cant enjoy the game, newbie always bullyed .. . â¥â¥â¥â¥
1076	1	a	BLUF: Kinda like GTA, if you like that you might like APB, and this is free!  Dislikes: Controls (Having a hard time using a controller, and some keybinds weren't working) Repetition (Every game has it, but it tends to feel quite the same after a day or so) No others at this time, sorry to disappoint!  Likes: Customization (You can customize your character, car and weapons. Many different looks!) Server Ranks (You get ranked based off your ability to play, but it's a little broke as you can drop rank easy) Free to Play (The F2P model isn't bad, and the premium value is worth it for an avid player)
1432	1	a	I know this game has a horrible reputation, however I am having quite a lot of fun with this game. Yes, you may run into some greifers (throw a grenade at them, explosions hurt everyone), but other than that, I have been having a lot of fun.  Excellent character, car and clothing editor, interesting mission system. Expect Call of Duty instead of WoW and you might get it.
5296	0	a	90% time spent in customization the rest to dieing to pay to wins  Time well spent
3980	0	a	Stay away from this game.  It's pay to win, free to grind and full of cheaters.  The community is one of the worst you can find anywhere.  Finally it's an over-priced cash grab operation; you have been warned.
6203	0	a	Great game idea, bad base players all out for themselves, devs are just wanting money shame could of been a great game and a bigger success if it was put on the right course.
7752	0	a	game dosent even download Gamersfirst and they call there company Gamersfirst lol
8361	0	a	Customization in this game is incredible, sadly hackers have destroyed any will to play. Was one of my favorite shooters.
1540	1	a	Robbing people and places with your friends is fun, especially the ones who have been robbing the people blind. Some say we are modern day Robin Hoods and others they just dont understand that we have a choice. Newton once said 'For every action there is always a equal and opposite reaction.'. This is our reaction, am i a criminal i dont think so, everyone needs a job right?, we all need a Payday.
9731	1	a	BOUT TIME DEM NERD NIKKAZ MAKE A GAME BOUT MUH HOOD DETROIT REPRE$ENT.
1648	1	a	Not the most riveting game of all time. It's VERY much a grind, the community is HORRIBLE, mostly just trolls and not only do the mods and GMs not care about trolling, they take an active part in it. They SAY cashshoping is 'balanced' and doesn't give cashshoppers an unfair advantage, but that SO isn't true.  The good, though? Pretty much unparalleled customization. Customizable clothes. Customizable cars. Even customizable MIDI-ish themes you opponent hears when you kill them.  This game seems to love to tap into that primal part of your brain that makes you want to show off your decaled-up car to the masses.    It's a time-killer, but definitely not something I'd pay money into. But that's just me. Paying into it apparantly DOES help the game progress faster... no joke, it gives you extra 'standing' and money.
9344	1	a	pretty fun game when playing with friends. but there are lots of difficult and complicated if you dont play it enough... plus its really hard to get vehicles so if your new your stuck in one place........
6364	0	a	This Game sucks â¥â¥â¥. It ALSO gave me 6 Trojans, so, the game pretty much costed me like $145, If you like that, press INSTALL   Note:These Trailers are NOTHING like the actual gameplay;In reality it's just a bunch of 11 year olds who have money to burn running around shooting you while you lag the **** out.   -10/10 -IGN 0/10000000000000000000000 - Dev  3.14/420 -11 year old 
5345	0	a	pay 2 win but its fun somtimes unless the people you verse have there moms credit cards as weapons
4090	0	a	Worst game ever! Do not play this S%#T.
9273	0	a	Game was poop when I actually bought it in 2011. Very confuseing, no help from anyone, bugged quests, unclear ability uses and stat description....... an all around fail. The only cool thing about it was the vehicles and haveing to buy gas and what not, because the version I got gave me a quad.
921	1	a	It's ok I guess.
5581	0	a	I would call this game Pay to Win. Argue if you want, but it's a multiplayer PVP game for the most part and you can buy cooldowns, permanent weapons ( some with exclusive mods, ) 2.25 times more cash gains etc...  You can buy pretty much everything permanently with real money right off the bat, be it cars, weapons, etc. If you want to be 100% Free to Play, be ready to spend tons of gold on 10-days lasting weapons. You will have to gather money for days to get one permanent weapon, only if someone is selling one on the Marketplace. The community is terrible, there's many bugs, random downtimes which cancel your missions and you lose the rewards you would have gotten for that misson. Also you can slaughter the whole city and be unnoticed, but be wary that breaking a store window by mistake, not even stealing anything and the other players playing enforcers can arrest you and steal all the money you have on you!  Also the matchmaking is terrible, sometimes you get matched with 2 other silvers and you have to face 3 golds. Your whole team could be rank 20 and you play against rank 200+ which have more mods, better cars, knows the game more and have better weapons. You have ''Bronze, Silver and Gold'' servers, but they're full of golds who like to pwn noobs either way. Only the leader can call for backup and people go AFK randomly pretty often.  Also, if your team leader ( which seems to be random because 90% of the time I join a mission I am not the leader, ) decides that he dosen't like you, he can kick you right before the mission ends to make you lose all the money and experience you would've gotten. He can also kick you just because you killed him by mistake, just because you sprayed a tag before him or even because you are MVP and he wants to be MVP instead!  The good? It's probably one of the only MMO that looks like GTA and Saints Row. The graphics are ok and the game has alot of content. Sadly, it's not a game I would play more than I already did after noticing all the flaws it has.  Here's the benefit of premium ( forums says it's 12.50$ per month: )  Around 90% bonus to all Contact XP gains. +125% bonus cash gain ( Instead of 500$ for a mission you would gain 1125$. ) 20% discount on the Armas Marketplace ( Real money marketplace. ) 50% shorter cooldown on abilities like Field supplier, Nitro booster, etc. ) Deeper Customization (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing items, 100 layers per Symbol. ) Removal of Subscription ADS ( which appears at the end of all missions. ) Armas Trials for weapons and vehicles last 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ( which makes using the 200~ trials, 6 times more effectively. )
2047	1	a	Great fun, cops and robbers. But look out everyone gets there â¥â¥â¥ kicked once in awhile by overly good players who enjoy a bit of grif. The grif all adds up to the almost school yard feel of cops and robbers, and adds a sense of emersion into the brutal world of a city tearing itself appart in crime and vigilatisem.

4161	0	a	The gameplay isn't bad... if it wasn't for the fact that this is a micotransaction filled game. All the guns have that 'buy it and own it for 9 days' kind of thing, which is annoying as hell.   I also can never seem to find other players to actually play matches with. Are people just not playing this or is the system just broken?   Has potential but just kinda sucks.

179	1	a	This game is a good one it does take some time to get better at it, but its very fun with friends
358	1	a	One of the most addictive open-world games I've played in a really long time. APB is great fun and packed full of unlockable in-game material such as vehicles, clothes, weapons, and many others. Plenty of features to keep you occupied for a very long time. Best part: It's free. Highly recommended.

5198	0	a	If you see a positive review on this game, you know they are scraping that from the OUTSIDE of the bottom of the barrel. This just a junk game.
7625	0	a	Take this from a guy who has played this game for 200 hours.  I started playing this game shortly after i became free to play in 2011 and I liked it. I played with my friends and they also liked it. But then I started noticing it had problems.  Graphics: It's graphics are okay and to be expected of a free to play game that was originaly created in 2010 but nothing to be amazed of.  The guns: For some reason the creators think people want a bilion guns to choose from, it's fine they excist but it ruins the came that they are so much better and you HAVE to spent real money on the REALLY good guns. Ruins it.  Gameplay: It depens, if you have a team of good players and you play against some fair people it's a great gameplay you have but that allmost never happens. Often you play against some scumbags who is premium and have bought a premium snipergun that oneshot's you. That is was ruin your game.  I can't really recommend it, yes I have enjoyed it but no, it's not worth it.

332	1	a	BEST GAME EVER! love it love it love it! both customization, fighting. everything 
3092	1	a	An absolute and horrid waste of time if you're looking to play something for fun. Cheaters, griefers, whiners and a horribly mismatched matchmaking system. Lag even in the same state as the server, a community typical to free MMO's (children and trolls), and a frustrating grind for simple items.  If you can get past all the negatives, the game has a decently fun fighting system when it isn't pitting you against a horribly imbalanced enemy; the customization is absolutely wonderful, if not lacking in just one or two things; and there's a little bit of charm to the characters and their backstories.  By the way, this isn't a game for lower spec computers.  In general, if you have the patience to deal with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t after â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, or can aim very well... This is a great game
10509	1	a	This is an amazing game which the developers abandoned. such a shame that there isnt any other game like it. But the COMMUNTY IS STILL ALIVE. my advice is to try this game before it dies forever. there are up to 100 people on it every day, which is enough for me.
5643	0	a	i reloaded 
9942	1	a	While it takes a while to getting used to, it's a hell of a lot of fun!:D
5675	0	a	This is a great game. This game is a sandbox MMO like GTA but with more customization options. The only problem with this game is the overwhelming amount of cheaters and the game lack of action to stop them. You can find cheat for this game with a quick Google search. So unless you're willing to buy to cheat or get lucky enough to be teamed with someone who has, your going to spend 75% of your time playing this game being killed repeatedly by one person with ungodly ability to know where you and your teammates are at all times and has perfect aim.
4348	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
1173	1	a	Its a game
8975	0	a	Hard to follow, Hard to play and hard to control. even worse is the fact that they haven't bothered to add any fighting or damage sounds so half the time you could be getting shot and not even realise!!
841	1	a	it is awesome have hade a lot of fun in the past and now time kill cops
6830	0	a	-Newbie unfriendly -PvP and matchmaking is horrible since it can easily get one sided once the game throws high level players agains low level players (found myself doing a mission, half an hour after I started playing the game, where I was up against three high level players, resulting in one shot kills on their side) -Driving mechanics are like strapping your b0ll0cks to a car battery.  -Weapon handling is, well, like removing the car battery, then strapping your b0ll0cks to a machine gun and wildly shaking your pelvis whilst hoping that the only thing youll shoot in your frenzy is the apple on your son's head.  Only good thing in this game is the customization possibilities, as long as you sell one of your b0ll0cks to be able to afford it.
2295	1	a	Really fun

10143	1	a	Have barely dented this game but so far it is pretty fun, contrary to other reviews the community is actual super friendly and helpful. Also contrary to other reviews Fallout fans will definitely enjoy this game, as long as you're not one of those close-minded gamers who compares every detail of a game to other triple A titles in the genre, yes it does give you a Fallout experience though it's not trying to be Fallout. It is it's own game. Kinda hard to get the hang of at first but if you are a vigilant gamer like myself you'll figure it out. Final note on that matter, there is a help channel in chat that you can ask anything on and every Vet and their mother that has figured the game out will give you better tips and advice than the wiki itself can. As far as mmorpgs go I'd give it an 8.5/10 mostly due to the unique immersive experience.
9588	0	a	uhh not my type of quiet lame action. if your super board an dont do shiz all day then i might recommend this game. for now thou. hell no. game is dumb.

10208	1	a	highly recommend if you like the fallout series mainly new vegas and fallout 3 this game is a little bit different though because theres a big emphasis on crafting and there are mounts and its multiplayer but kindof the same setting as fallout with the whole desert waistland and mutated creatures and factions
8247	0	a	It used to be an amazing game with great potential, but G1 sunk it down year after year &amp; without any improvement at all, sinking the game further down while releasing new armas content (real life money) reskin weapons only nothing new at all, nothing new for F2P, just P2P content all the way &amp; no promises they make are being kept on improving anything at all...  If you're new to this game i STRONGLY recommend you to stay as far away as you can, if you're thinking of coming back to the game again just look the other way... if you never raged before in your life this game will make you rage everywhere if you play it.
3310	1	a	Very fun, very exciting and it makes me hard! This game has so much to it, there is almost never something to not do, but warned little wallets, they vant ur moneyz I do not recommend purchasing ANYTHING for this game, it's a free game, it's fun to keep it that way
9412	1	a	Oh boy yes do I reccomend this game. The Combat system is a clever mix of Third/First Person Shooting/Melee like Skyrim or Fallout with some Tab Combat like WoW when casting Mutations (Basically spells for healing, damage and support) so you can choose to simply ignore one play style over the other or use a mix of one. If you want to dual wield two, one handed melee weapons or guns then go for it, the game allows you to even use a one handed melee and gun at the same time, basically filling melee and range in one go.  BE AWARE though that the mouse buttons are backwards, to use the weapon in your right hand click the left mouse button and vice versa. I haven't found a way to fix this without it affecting interactions with the world so my advice is don't change it.  The only flaws are the sound and beginners confusion. I personally found the ambience quite annoying and the game is very quiet out of combat but I suppose you could call it relaxing.  At the beggining of the game you follow a simple tutorial dungeon (with good voice acting) and then you get to pick one of three starter locations that tailor to how you would like to play.   You have a few starter quests which thankfully come one at a time but when you leave that slice of starter land and head into town then you'll find there are lots of quests that need doing. They don't appear very cleatly on the mini map so look hard and you'll notice little hazard symbols like the desktop icon bare visible on the mini map. Those are quest icons.  I did notice that the starter areas seem to follow a similar story at first, just in a different landscape.  One thing that really confused me was Tradeskills. I'm sure once I devote more time to the game and decide what kind of character I want to be I'll understand it better.  If you want a nice little MMO that puts the best features of WoW and Fallout into one then have a go...
5281	0	a	The game is absolute trash. It's no fun. The only way it keeps players is making them addicted. And making them hope one day they'll get that engine update. You will expect most people that play this game have no friends which you always have to expect. The community is is just horrific and unexplainable. The custimization is to primitive and needs to be improved. The graphics are insanely outdated. The gameplay is repetitive. The weapons don't even make sense.   Don't play this game if you don't want to waste your life. I do not recommend this game at all. It might say I played for only 300 hours. But that was when I got steam. I've played this game for over four years and I regret all of it. There is better games out there. Just steal your mom's credit card and you will get games that have the best they can offer.
7843	0	a	The gameplay itself can be summed up as a pretty-looking timesink: It does a good job of drawing you in, but between large loading times and rather grindy gameplay it struggles to keep you there.  But I've found myself spending hours just dicking around with the various character/outfit/vehicle/logo customisation editors (and there is a LOT of customisation you can do in this game), so there's that I guess.

7337	0	a	To put it bluntly. It's not a fun game. MMO's aren't my thing really, but this is just bad. To many different tabs, buttons, and overlay options to worry about. Plus, you can totally â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself over early game, by messing up 1 part of the intro.
10092	0	a	Was not fond of it 30 seconds in. Did not even give it a chance, looked like poor mans fallout. HUD way too cluttered right at the start.

Will you dive into the Criminal World where you rob stores and hold up people for everything they got.

The choice is yours in this adventurous game of the year.  10/10 - BrandonMoore.TV
10745	1	a	I have over 100 hours in this game. This game is very fun and competotive. I know that the game has not been updated in 2 years. I was there for the last update back in 2013. I still have played the game even though there was only, like, 300 people in-game. But now they are back with a new update! So i'm very happy and excited that they have finally come back to this amazing FPS. I also heard that they are adding a new map! So that is freaking awesome! I will recommend this game :D

3129	1	a	BEST game EVER
4853	0	a	Experience starting: 1: Toxic, immature playerbase rife with racial slurs and homophobia. 2: Poor balancing. First mission in the starting zone was put right in against two other players one with a grenade launcher. Not a good first experience. 3: There is no actual tutorial, you have to figure out everything for yourself, which is fine except plenty of things don't make any sense. IE you can't shoot at criminals in the midst of a crime spree unless your in their mission even though the game claims you can 'witness criminal activity with alt' to start a mission against them. Lots of unspoken rules, lots of players will lose their minds if you actually complete mission objectives. 4: Driving feels sloppy. 5: Gunplay feels weak. Headshots apprently don't count, certain weapons have so far been abysmal. Shotguns that can't kill beyond 5 feet, pistols that just can't kill even when you sneak around and initiate. Long time to kill makes the game feel like the shooter gameplay is tacked on. 6: All the guns cost money if you want them for more than ten days apparently. 7: Most of the civillians look identical. You basically have a city apparently populated by janitors and hookers who can't blink. 8: Customization has lots of options.  In all I tried to give it a fair shake but it disappointed me at most every turn. Was expecting a fun cops and robbers game where you could jump right into heists as they occur and create scenarios organically. Instead its basically a giant arena game with junky weapons and obscure rules that aren't explained. This is all covered in a festering morass of immature and rude players.  Didn't spend in the cash shop, I don't mind them in free to play games (gotta make money somehow) but the situation (temporary weapons and cash shop purchases) give me the impression they're trying to get the last drops out of this game before it dies completely.  3/10.
10296	1	a	i dowloaded it....everything was fine and then i got to the start menu. i pressed the button to create a ew account repeatedly and it didnt work. 
4867	0	a	I had a very sorrowful experience with this game a couple years ago. Filled with cheaters and negligent staff. I felt like leaving a review, because I had spent thousands of hours playing and upwards of $500 in the game. The company managing this game (Gamersfirst) is incredibly horrid and I would not recommend playing this game to anyone. Wish I could have avoided it.

3216	1	a	a great game but a bit laggy for me but its a awsome game
6029	0	a	It's meh, i've come to realize at this point this game largely filled with the aspect of P2W which is basically you buy premium and get a bonus of 100% for everything along with that hackers are known and don't get dealt with. So far i've sent in three support tickets with suspected cheaters and gave clear images along with links with there emails and names tied to hacking sites that confirm that they do pay for cheats for atleast another game at the best.   They've responded to one and still haven't replied with any others, the support ticket I was responded was a giant robotic reply which basically is summed up as the TLDR version; 'We will look into the matter, however we can't tell you anything about the player due to privacy concerns, etc, etc'. It's been 48 hours now and hes been hackusated by a entire server and multiple people accuse him of speedhacking which he abused along with his aimbot.  The P2W aspect is that for a meesly $5 you can get a Perm gun of four choices that are usually really good and do indeed own the free versions, you get a free car which is also nice along with 500 G1C credits and 31 days of membership. With that you've basically made it so you're going to outlevel normal players by atleast 60% faster and don't have to waste your money on guns and cars early rather saving up and being able to purchase the end-games guns and cars soon as they're unlocked for you. However the most P2W element is the Arma weapons themself due the fact you're able to purchase much stronger versions of the F2P guns at much lower ranks along with having unique perks such as silencers, better modifiers, etc.
3617	1	a	Entertaning shooting and driving game. Kind of a mmo GTA with lots of cosmetic configurations of the caracter, cars and clothing. The options are how ever mostly cosmetical.  Very hard to get a grip of att the start as there is a extream lack of instructions and information at the beginning. Free to play, but as with most F2P games its more like free to try. You really need to by the premium after a while to get the bonus exp and cach rewards, if you dont progression gets very slow and teadious.

6377	0	a	This game is so innapropriet and it's encoureged for younger kids to play it insted of GTA. This game should be removed from steam and never have anything like this again.
2721	1	a	awesome game, if only they made every item just a bit cheaper. but i dont care. EPIC COPS AND ROBBERS LIKE GAME.
2539	1	a	I got this game, and made an account to play it, but when i got on to try and play the game, it said that i was not old enough to play. seeing as i am 21, i am really confused as to why the game thinks i am not old enough. is there a way to fix this?
9736	0	a	The engine is so bad that my grandmother dont want to play this game.  
3432	1	a	love this game
9002	1	a	good game for poor â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit dickball anal â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
10812	1	a	Hard af but once you get a kill you'll wet your pants a little
7322	0	a	A great game with a super awesome amount of customization. However the pay-2-win model ruins most the game.
1708	1	a	its a good game but right now it wont let me play it :/ for some reason
10544	1	a	(NEW)   Game is playable again! Classes and perks stripped down to three basic classes: Heavy, medium and light, all basic weapons available at master level. The specialty weapons are unlockable with xp or gold as usual, but they're no better than the standard weapons, just specialized. If you spent xp before with your account, it has been reimbursed due to the heavy changes to the game.  If you're having trouble running the game through steam, run the highrez installer in the tribes:ascend exe folder, let it uninstall then run it again to reinstall it in another folder preferably. Now you can run it through steam!             (OLD)People seem to confuse 'pay4lazy/aesthetics(which are pointless as a tiny spec) with pay4unfair advantage.  You can say this game is pay2notgrind, but that's boring. Paying unlocks all the perks, classes and weapons that are unlockable anyway by fighting matches. When you git gud at this game, no paying idiot will ever be a match for you.
10523	1	a	Awesome game and really deserved more attention than it got. So glad they're sticking with it!
9818	0	a	Ordinary cheater filled MMORPG with guns it gets boring quickly the combat is limited once you've created some stuff and played for a Bit crafted ETC the excessive craft times p2w system bleh...........
8109	0	a	Just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as the first time this game came out.
4095	0	a	A great potential â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up by its devs. What a waste of a good game...  EDIT: came back after 4 years to see what happened to this game.  Less players, more hackers, more pay2win G1 slaves, the same exploits and bugs from 2012, a few new guns and cars but not new gamemodes or important updates, ... My suggestion: Don't even try this game, it was a bit playable back in 2012 but now it's just impossible.
7696	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
9292	0	a	Don't.
1541	1	a	I've been unfairly matched against Max Ranks, Carbine'd directly into insanity, and glitched out of so many missions to the point I ask myself why I still pick up the mouse and try.  Favorite Game I have, GOTY 11/10 Would reccomend to friends and enemies alike.  EDIT: a year later and I still feel the exact same.
1260	1	a	This is a sandbox game close to GTA. Lots of this to do. Like kill a randomer. rob a car. Jump of a building. An endless variety of things to do. So click that install button. It might take a while to load but its worth it. And for those peeps who love making characters you can make a character. Choose from criminal and enforcer. Get better weapons and clothes and Rule your World!!!!!!
3190	1	a	cooooool nice games of open world games
8728	0	a	did i really spend 6 hours doing nothing
1047	1	a	If you feel like playing GTA but you don't have enough to buy the game, this game is a good substitute for it. APB is awesome. You can design your character like a badass muddapucker. You can get awesome guns and cars. You can race, play missions with your friends and kill pedestrian like a boss. The game is hard in the beginning because of some A-hole in the game who has better guns and cars than you. But don't be discourage, you'll get there. Trade items with your friends like an awesome car. Everyone should play this game, it's awesome.
2235	1	a	Great for shenanigans, as in screwing other players over, by exploding the cars or ramming them over with larger size trucks.  Used to run great before, now i just can't for some reason.
6173	0	a	The uninstall button works Thats the only thing thats works  
9893	0	a	If your the kind of person who thinks shoving broken glass in your â¥â¥â¥â¥ is relaxing leisure, then you will LOVE this game.
1596	1	a	Here, you can rent weapons. 10/10, I would rent again.
2207	1	a	grand theft auto on steroids
8016	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
812	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing

1294	1	a	I have been playing this game for a very long time now. It is fast paced, open world and really fun. The character customization is amazing, and makes the game so much more fun. I play on both teams, enforcer and criminal. They both got their pro's and con's but they both have their own playstyle to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes openworld RPG kind of games.

9314	1	a	I enjoyed this game, up until the 'how I horse' questions bore through my skull like a diamond bullet. I never really joined a clan, but I did team up with people now and then. Can't say as a single player that I have had too many people try to kill my characters (factions). Haven't played in awhile, but my recollections was that the mods were very helpful, the forums full of information, and the pace was easy and slow (for some parts). Grinding is what you have to do and I got tired of it.
4715	0	a	Apparently it's pay to win, although I couldn't really tell. Everyone had lots of gear, somebody shot me and I had no idea what was going on.
6719	0	a	well all i have to say about this game is that its completely bull crap because every time u try to log in with your email and password it always gives that error 11386 or something like that and u try looking it up on youtube or something to tell u how to fix it we follow the directions and it still doesnt work and its annoying u cant really enjoy this game when u cant even GET PASS THE FREAKING SIGN IN AND ITS FREAKING ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i highly not recommend this game
3859	0	a	This game is awful.   1. FPS mechanics are terrible, with NO HEAD HITBOXES. AWFUL HIT DETECTION. EXTREMELY LONG TTK (which would be fine if there were skill-based mechanics involved).   2. Extreme pay to win a la Asian shooter, i.e. you have to either spend all of your time playing this game, spend money, or fail to be competitive due to expiring weapons.   3. Maps and respawns were balanced by chimps. Some missions favor one side immensely over the other. Not to mention the vapid objective based gameplay.   4. Matchmaking is terrible with veterans having extreme advantages over new players with perks. Sure CoD can do this, but it doesn't make it any less stupid.   5. Cheaters abound.   6. Little variety at the core of the game which is quintessentially a few big team-based CTF flags with car chases in between. Sounds fun on paper and is fun the first 30 times, then it gets old along with the rock-paper-scissors gunplay.   The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are fair and it runs.. alright. The character, car and clothes customization is amazing, along with the custom themes (music editor), but it's at the core a grindy, imbalanced collection of little CTF maps where the world around you feels fake and shallow, just like the gunplay.   Don't waste your time downloading this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. It had potential 10 years ago. Now it's just a waste.

4983	0	a	Pay2Win Garbage, after many attempts and after buying weapons with in-game cash, the quality was very poor.  Stunning bullets are OP as hell and need real money to buy, at all costs, AVOID this game.
2184	1	a	Fast cars, Sweet guns, and money (that isn't yours) sounds amazing, but when you play the game, you get to live it.
9306	0	a	i couldnt even play the damn game. i made my character simple enough but the moment i stepped into the starting area the game froze. so i waited until it unfroze and it did. once it unfroze i looked around with the camera and no issues. then i tried moving and froze again. repeted multiple times. apperently this is common and reproducable. the tells me that whom ever made this game either doesnt care about it or are dropping the game altogether. but all in all until this huge issue with the game is resolved you won't see me anywhere near it.

271	1	a	This is a F2P game that has withstood the test of time for me. Unparalleled shooter action as far as I'm concerned. Takes a lot of getting used to and not for the faint of heart.
1954	1	a	After I spent 570 Hours on this game and Unfortunatelly I am still going , because yes it is a great Idea and a unique game, similar to it in no other console, it combines 'Sims' (Full Character customization) , Call of Duty(for its shooting nature and the full customization on weapon mods skins etc), Bit more than Need for Speed (for its customization on your cars), GTA (Open world maps you drive around doing missions or troll people by ramming them over or turn their cars upside down when you're bored to run a mission), These are all the advantages, lets see the Disadvantages, Old Unreal Engine, Hackable big time, we bump into hackers all the time during weekends, lag spikes, shots won't register and one day you rock the next day you shoot the actual player and no shots will register on him.  I ve spent money on this game and responsibly I am advising you, there's no actual quality in this game at the moment, It is fun to play good idea, but no Actual quality, it is full of bugs, hacks , it is not a game to take seriously and sucrifice sleep for game-play, recommending this game just because it is a good unique idea, and we had some good times with friends and the great community this game has gathered, unfortunately most of it is gone, soon will update my review with the current most populated servers on 2014 to save you New players some time.

10049	1	a	Ok so, where do I start? This game was a game I was very fond of (As my time spent playing it might show) and I've already written a review before but since it was kinda choppy I stepped upon it again and decided to add to it.  I've been playing this game for around 4 years back when I started around 2012 when I was also first introduced to steam, so along with downloading TF2 this game caught my eye as my love of post-apoc settings for games sparked my intrigue. Back then, this game just had so much to offer, to me in particular as I was fine with discovering most of it for myself with managing to obtain an ATV early on.   In terms of gameplay, the whole grinding aspect didn't really bother much as I was still managing to have fun cooperating with various people I would meet around placed like Embry (I think that was the name of the main S1 city?) and City where there was an event to protect a town made up by players from enemy mobs (Called Shivas If I'm correct) where you would see people showing off their cool gear and mounts.  The PvP aspect of the game was never really anything I tapped into, It just didnt really intrest me, but I'm sure theres some players out their who saw its potential.  To end this review of, no matter how bad it is, I guess this game is kinda dead with its peak being off in the earlier years where I made a few friends on my way to Lvl 55.  If anyone remembers me, my main characters name was Brad Carson, with other names like Pvt.Brad being another char of my mine, and to anyone who remembered me, It was a pleasure having played a fun game with you for quite a few years.   Sorry if this review was pretty bad, I'm just really getting over a lot.
7489	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
5639	0	a	Has amazing customization options for cars and clothing however you have to pay to win and be able to beat people from much higher skill levels
7821	0	a	this game SUCKS
8754	0	a	I'll be honest as I possibly can be with this review in particular.  The game is tough when you start out (ofcourse, because ALL games do), and when you progress on, it becomes easier. I'll say it again, tough when starting out... easier when you keep playing. The only thing that most people dont realize and should. There are also, positive and nevative things to the game (again, all games do), but to be basic, i'll narrow it down to the exact things that are good and bad about this game.  So, whats good is, theres huge customization on just characters alone, as well as symbols and audio, with its own feel for car physics and mechanics that are actually quite interresting and unique.  What is bad, is nothing of the actual game its self, but the people who play it. I wont lie, the majority of guns are quite difficult to handle, which its not that bad if you think about it, just means you need to try... since you cant win anything by doing nothing. But, the majority of people that tend to play this game on a daily basis, end up ruining it for everyone, including themselves. Stupid, is it not? Sadly, these are all of the ones who end up cheating just because they dont bother to play the game, or just do it because they feel powerful and have no actual lives to do anything but ruin things for everyone.  If you can do just one thing, maybe... just maybe, I can truely recommend this game to anyone. That one thing is: Try, without ruining everything, even for other fellow players who desperately attempt to make a good clean day of APB:Reloaded.
4899	0	a	Nah m8. Memories of the game consits of horrid ping (I'm in Australia, so obviously so) BUT every other game I play, where I play in an American server, does not give me a 1 - 2 second delay from when I press a key to when I move in the game. APB Reloaded is the only game to do this. That isn't even the worst part. Horrible P2W, so much scripting and hacking and a horrible community. My biggest memory of this game was when I was in a mission and my team was so close to winning but a person outside the mission drove and parked a van right over the checkpoint we needed and continued to sit in the van and wait there until our timer ran out, once it did, he drove off. There was nothing we could do about it.
4510	0	a	do yourself a favor and dont play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
8897	0	a	In my opinion this game is not worth anyone's time, and here is why: 1. Launcher downloads and installs 200Mb worth of updates for ages.  2. A lot of EULAs which activate every time I launch the game. 3. â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics and animations. I know the game is old, but for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake refresh it from time to time. If modders can do it, so can you. 4. Character customization unacceptable. Not enough options to choose from, and existing ones are fugly. 5. Controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥. Movement is jerky, its god damn hard to access stuff around you. there are two screen modes where one is basically there for no reason. Everything could be and was intergrated into a single mode and nobody should have to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing switch it. UI layouts are kind of neat, but god damn hard to access with those camera and mouse modes. Designer should quit alcohol. 6. Can't block in melee, gun recoil is â¥â¥â¥â¥, shooting sounds and effects are â¥â¥â¥â¥. 7. Right after the tutorial game glitched and caused me to fall perpetually. Had to close it by ending Processes in Task Manager.   2/10

8879	1	a	This game is one of the best F2P games I have ever played, and the biggest F2P game I have ever played.  +The game world is huge. It spans over sectors and the overall map is bigger then triple A titles such as GTA V and Just Cause 2.  +Character customisation. When you start the game you have the ability to change the appearance of your character, and during the game you can equip things that can add benefits and features, like dusters or combat suits.  +Clans and teams. In game there is a team system that people can join into so that you can complete a mission together, and some missions require that. The team system also allows voice chat. There is also a clan system that works like normal, and the clan has a special 'clan vault' that they can use.  +Mega server. All players are on one server, but it works due to the map size.  +Vehicles. The game has various mounts, such as horses and even giant mutated chickens, along with motorbikes, ATVs, dune buggys, and more.  -Microtransactions. Since this is a free to play game, it is a given. You can buy almost any item in the game on their store. But I do not mind doing this from time to time, as I enjoy the game to the point that I want to support it.  -Graphics. They aren't very good. Good news for people on lower end PCs like me, but for somebody running a machine that costs as much as a small family vehicle, not so much.  -Voice acting. Barely any of it... at all. It is really BAD, it just isn't common.  -Buggy. Some bugs will occur in the game, but there is usually a fix. Usually.  TL;DR: This game is a pretty fun first person post apocalyptic online RPG. Possibly the only one of its kind. If you liked Fallout, you should try it out. If you hated Fallout, you. I reccomand this game for anyone, really. 
403	1	a	PLEASE HELP ME MY GAME SHOWS THE SPLASH SCREEN THEN IT GOS AWAY AND DOESNT RUN!PLEASE HELP ME!
826	1	a	its ok. if you start new now its really hard to git gud
3291	1	a	This is an really awesome game played over 250 hours with my main account !
6414	0	a	Pay to win
4769	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!! It is just not fun when you can't firstperson or have to walk all the way across the city. There are probably 10 car in the game and most suck at driving. I'm going to leave it there.
5129	0	a	Won't load for me.
1331	1	a	Really cool!
7584	0	a	Positives:  &gt; Insane character and vehicle sustomization. Designing the charcter is quite fun. &gt; Frequent promotional stuff to keep you interested. (free premium account time)  Negatives: &gt; Persistent lag: This is the only reason why the game isn't playable for me right now. The lag is very frustrating and an unavoidable part of the game. The probability of lag is lower in low population servers(where there are like only 5 guys) But playing in low population servers means extremely long mission queues and low payots without opposition. It is no fun at all.
4403	0	a	Bought APB when it originally came out, glad that's it's 'free2play', shame that it's now 'pay2win', and if you wanna win, it's not cheap. One thing I really do love in this game: Customisation. There is so much customisation in this game; customising you're custom character with custom items that can be customised with custom created patterns, that's a seriously impressive amount of customisation. Which is why I don't understand, with the wealth of cosmetic options available, why all the 'real money' items can't just be the 'cosmetic' ones. From tattoos to new hair styles to the 100's of clothing items (of which more can be created) and bazillions of combinations that this gives you, there is surely enough content there to continue to fund this game without selling overpowered weaponry. Path of Exile does it. Path of Exile doesn't even have much customisation. But no. pay2win Well, you'll have the occasional fun match with equally skilled, equally equipped players, but only 'occasionally'. More than often, you'll be pitted against player's that have forked out for the massively 'over-powered-death-weapons-of-instant-death' weaponry, and then any skill you've aquired at playing well; will mean naught. If you've just won the lottery and want to spend it in a game where overpowered weaponry destroys all form of difficulty and balance then this is for you. If not, than you can still try the game out, it's 'free2play' after all, but I doubt you'll stay long.
7840	0	a	One Word:LAAGGGGGG!!!!!
9514	1	a	Fun for quite a while actually for a long time for me but it gets boreing after a bit (played solo most of the time)
4529	0	a	This game is a pretty standard example of how to milk a game for all it is worth using already existing assets.  I was an original player from back when the game was owned and run by Real Time Worlds (R.I.P) and published by EA. I was one of the first batch of players to play APB Reloaded during the closed beta period. After open beta is began it's continuous downward spiral.  Pros - Customization, it's nearly unmatched in the options for customizations  Cons - Poor community and lack of in-game moderating; griefers, hackers and inappropriate behavior that isn't punished. - Dominated by in-game microtransaction system; you'll rarely find people that play consistently who don't spend money in some form. It's not impossible to play without paying, takes a noticeable amount of time for it to be worth it. - Unoptimized. - Poor matchmaking; back during closed beta there weren't districts that were divided by 'threat level', so often times higher ranked players would get matched against many more people than were in their group. I consider that a step up to what is currently in the game. - Poor spawn system; pretty easy to push on a spawn so the enemy spawns farther away, and car spawners have completely ruined the dynamic of the game.
4743	0	a	i accidentally left this game open while sleeping
5462	0	a	Corrupt devs make this once amazing game an utter nightmare for any players wanting to sink 40+ hours into it.
3543	1	a	Very nice customization. That's essentially the main point and drive of the game. Takes some skill too. It's okay.
2071	1	a	good but rage inducing game
10102	1	a	One of the best MMORPGs I have ever played! A real big game of PvP, so gear and kill players!

8309	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
7158	0	a	Almost worse than LoL
2715	1	a	Great game before it went free to play.
6136	0	a	dusty knockoff of gta 
1067	1	a	Have Fun Killing and stealing on game 'I recommend This Game.'
8887	0	a	The updater is beyond broken so good luck even trying to update. or even play.  This should be removed from steam since it's dead and broken beyond repair.
284	1	a	Like owning noobs and hearing people call you a hacker cause you can peak corners like Bond? Then this game is for you.
2123	1	a	Basically GTA: Online but with more general customization and less graphic capability and... the physics are not as good as GTA: Online's.
672	1	a	well i haven't play this game before but i watched it on youtube and go type the channel who make the apb reloaded video is rapid99apb police chase on youtube type it there and you can like talk to people make friends shoot enemies and all that kind of stuff you can drive all the day's work of san paro and you can shoot criminials i must have said it already but oh well thats the support i need bye
1033	1	a	Great game would recoment to anybody wanting action
9042	0	a	The Pics they show make it look way batter then it is i play very little abd i hated it its a very bad game  one thing more the chikens well sopose to be chikens look like â¥â¥â¥â¥.... i hate this game and shiver to see it......
4196	0	a	i played this game for well over 300 hours, it full of hackers, unless you wanna spend real money on this game. i would say dont brother, this game is truly cancer
9047	1	a	I recommend playing this game if you like to kill things 
4478	0	a	This game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad
3546	1	a	It takes a while to progress in the game and there is a large risk of skilled players (gold-rank wankstains) entering newbie-servers just to mess up your day. AND it's easier to buy the guns, cars and misc with real money than to play the game non-stop for days to get the new shotgun you've always seen those golden â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s wield and then only have it for like 3 days. The in-game currency takes a while to get alot of as well.  All in all, though, this is a creative person's DREAM game. You can customize cars, outfits, characters, themes and songs and utilize that ultimate strategic plan you've dreamed about for so long. If you ever wanted that intimate gaming experience with a small dev team and well-meaning regulars playing the game, this is it.  Even though the negative sides of the game may seem overwhelming, the devs and community are working hard to make new players feel welcomed in this game. I would seriously recommend this game if you have patience for it and if you are social person. Making friends with veteran players is a pro tip from a person with 493 hours plus in this game.  I hope this was useful for you if you've ever wanted to try a free GTA experience. DON'T let the mixed ratings of this game scare you away. Try it! If you've even considered playing this game for what it is, give it a try. It delivers ;-)
659	1	a	It's like a GTA, but online.Visual very realistic and you can make tatooes,change cars and sounds.
562	1	a	Fun game at times. Friendly community. Bad thing about this game is smurfing and its pretty much P2W. Doesnt help new players too much Alternative to GTA
6634	0	a	Game is okay, nothing spectacular though
3824	0	a	This Game is the epitome of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The redeeming qualitites of this game are few and far between, Playing with your friends on this game can be fun but other than that the gunplay is horrible, You can hide in a vehicle because vehicles have a health bar instead of a damage model and then jump out like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when your enemy is reloading, This causes people to use tactics that take advantage of obvious flaws in the game like using overpowered guns. This game is just pure â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless played with friends , then it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ with sprinkles ontop
6112	0	a	This is one of the worst games ive ever played. Everyone is a higher level then you and you cant do anything because its never a fair fight
178	1	a	I am R130 ENF and R70 CRIM, this game is pretty enjoyable for me because of the sheer customization. The reason I have stopped playing is because of CS:GO (Nothing to do with APB: Reloaded itself). There are so many interesting things you can do on this game, for example spamming WASD to run in a circle and evade bullets like Neo from the Matrix! Or using LTL (Less than Lethal) Grenade launchers to stun everyone for days! There are quite a few cars, and in all honesty, there is no point in playing this game whatsoever without a premium sub. If you're not an Artist like me, than don't fret, you can still find music and cars designed by others for a fee. It may be difficult for you to place yourself in this game, or to have fun if you do not have friends who PC game, but don't worry! There are many clans and groups that play that aren't hacking, and some of them are really friendly. :D  Anyways, this games Guns (and many other items) are timed, which isn't really a problem TBH (I did eventually buy permanent weapons over a span of 3 years), and you definitely feel the prestige of getting higher and higher level. My brother plays this as well, all he does is create music to sell. It's worked out very well for him, he can buy anything on the game he wants aside from Joker content.  All in all, I recommend playing this game at least long enough to get to R100, hopefully you'll have a good time and enjoy the game to it's fullest by then. :)
1028	1	a	its fun to play and its good but there is hackers.
3128	1	a	This game is AWESOME, been playing it for almost a year now. Ppl who read this. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY IT! :D
8517	0	a	Dont Get me wrong the Game is funn but theres some game changing bugs such as if someone is close enough to the wall the can shoot you through it killing you. another thing theres only one server For NA(North America) and theres way to admins that abuse i was kicked about 12 times in the middle of gameplay i enjoyed playing for a bit but the admins really didnt allow me to play its worth downloading if you Are able to play without getting kicked. good luck dont download this game if you dont have the patients
8278	0	a	Game used to be good now its pay to win and Full of Hackers...Now that is is going to be released on PS4 and XboxOne forget about playing PC version the Devs have given up and most of the time FairFight doesnt do anything about the Hackers..
9617	0	a	If Fallot was an endless MMO grind with horrible enemy AI
3467	1	a	good game apart from the other powered players.
8538	0	a	Terrible. Just terrible. From its suspicious anti-cheat engines running in the background to the 2005 graphics, this game makes my list for one of the most bland and boring games. Do not download it.  Pros:  -It's free.  Cons: -Horrible lowly community of people who seek therapists. -Pay to customize. -Graphics are terrible even on the highest settings. -Frames are always 15-20 fps on a desktop that has 12 gigabytes of RAM. -Feels like a GTA clone. -A world with little to do but kill others. -Strange lighting. -Very confusing to get the hang of missions and what you're even supposed to do. -Launcher always fails at least once before it is able to successfully launch. -Disorganized world. -The two factions feel very unorganized. -Causes me to vomit.
319	1	a	Very fun game,especially if you're in a clan of cool people.It has some cons though: -Servers usually lagging -Some hackers -Really hard to get into especially if you're alone,it is NOT an easy game  But it has lots of cool features: -Big maps with detailed environnements and a feeling of living city (with players+npcs) -A looooot of weapons you can get -Not p2w at all,you can beat a premium or legendary gun user with a free gun -A quite good community (of course there are some idiots but its a minority)ready to help most of the time  YES,i recommend this game,if you're ready to get into,do it,its free! :)
9361	0	a	The game is full of problems,and problems cant be solved by ignoring them.
2496	1	a	I thank that APB Reloaded is a good game for online gameplay. If you like Blowing up your friends cars, Killing peoples drug mules, and more of this trolly contint that you will LOVE this game! From making cars to giving you millions of guns, Most everything is 'Man Made.' (You can make it your way) Its always cool when you speed by a nub with a pink drug van!
6996	0	a	To be honest, if you wanna enjoy this game be prepared to spend at least 300 dollars more on it. The average is 1500 dollars.  Enjoy your pay to win free to play game.
7567	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-
840	1	a	The game gave me bluescreens all the time, it is a pay to win game mostly (cars and weps). Except this its good
5446	0	a	This game has a great potential to be a fun little distraction, when having flashlights and lasers shone into your eyes is too 'realistic' for you, or when WoW is too 'click-to-win' for your taste.  Mixing MMO and TPS in a pretty strange mix, the action, customization, and open world feel you can find in this game have impressed me. For a free to play, pay to win game it turned out to be rather enjoyable even without transactions.  However, the only reason I can NOT recommend trying this game, is its match making system. You, as a new player, must not only understand your chosen role, criminal or enforcer, but also your role as fodder. The match maker feeds you to higher levels quite readily, and to make sure you, as the fodder, can't leave the trough it drops you into, you are not permitted to leave a mission once you've been pulled into it.  Feeding higher ranks isn't avoidable. You have cheap guns and no armor, they have very powerful guns and armor that grants them greater health than you. In a CQC fight between yourself, wielding an SMG made for CQC, and a high level enemy, wielding a high power rifle made for sniping, the higher level will win due to the fact their armor soaks your bullets, and your lack of armor doesn't soak their far stronger bullets.  Ultimately, the choice you must decide on before you pick up this game is this: Do you want to be a feeder, or do you want to be a competitor? If you chose the latter, hit the back button on the store browser and find another free game.
10028	1	a	epic game with huge open world worth playing
10054	1	a	Stumbled on this game and decided to try it out. It's a fairly outdated graphics system, understandably as it's an older game, but it's still very much intriguing from the start, if you can get past the graphics (some people demand more with our current tech these days, and nothing wrong with that.) Anyhow, the style of gameplay is fun and keeps you busy, while the maxed out players online I've often found to be quite helpful. The downfall to the community thing, is that there's hardly one left from what I've seen. I'm cool with that though. I have fun solo or with the occasional team mates. It's open world and fully explorable, with all kinds of weapon/armor upgrades and crafting involved. Basically like a dumbed down red dead redemption meets morrowind meets MMO. It's cool, worth the download, especially since it's f2p. 8/10
4627	0	a	This Game sux ... Bad Gta 5 MP simulator -  Not playable  Unbalanced fights  Random â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ts  Only 3-4 missions all time just random places...  Graphic lvl Mario (btw mario still best than this)  +   here? hmm wait... nope
2996	1	a	Very fun game so many gamemodes so you never really get bored :D
7806	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
605	1	a	Pros+++ +Character creation. +Customization. clothes,vechile,songs,etc. +Decent graphics. +Vehicles. +Lot of challenge. (Its not enough u know how to aim, u cant just run centre of street!) +Can find kind player too, true nerds, u can even buy zelda songs!  Cons--- -Matchmaking!! (U have to join bronze district if u silver or lower threat!) -Toxic/cheating community like most of competive games. -Devs dont to right thinks to improve game. -Some of guns are bit p2w. -Sometimes game lag when it get ddosed. -Car spawnz are op! -Fog of war. -No headshots. -Mission reward low without premium.  Still better game than cs go.
8652	0	a	This game was fun for a while, but quickly got boring. Along with that you've got the most cringe-worthy and toxic of communities, and you just end up with a hot mess that likes to charge you 40-bucks for Pay to Win guns, and overall it's just not worth the effort.  This was a game we all looked forward to and drooled over... but in the end it didn't live up to what it could have potentially offered. And honestly I think a lot of that had to do with gamersfirst being in charge of it. Quit a slimey company, especially if you read any of their official responses on their forums.
3592	1	a	You either like it or hate it... Try it for yourself and youll get what i mean
5887	0	a	EVERY FRIKIN TIME I TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME I JOIN A SERVER AND I LEAVE IN 1 MINUTE AND A PUNKBUSTER ERROR COMES UP. F**K PUNKBUSTER
7169	0	a	This game has been completely ruined by the devs.   Instead of it being Free, they should actually pay us to play this thing.  Seriously, buy GTA V if you wanna play a game like this, spare yourself the suffering.
5276	0	a	Joined a place called fightclub and this guy named MrEpicGoat kept killing me, I think he's a hacker, or just really good, since the game is pay to win I bet he bought the ability to run really fast.
474	1	a	Welcome to APB Reloaded also got Hacker obv and no car when you need one &gt;_&lt;
6726	0	a	from the 'less than an hour' i played of this game, it has way too many problems for me. first off, in installing the game, it takes forever to download on even my connection, and i have 35mb/s up AND down. once it finally downloads, and is playable, i get some sort of registry error.   at this point, i was able to get into the game, the login system is a little strange. after a few minutes playing the game i got kicked from the server by punkbuster after dying, and am unable to rejoin the game. message i got was 'restriction:service abnormality'  i was hoping to give this game a good review, lokked really cool, but cant do that if i cant even get into the damn game.
3780	0	a	Pros:  -Best character customization in any game -Many cars -100 people districts -Fight clubs for constant action  Cons:  -â¥â¥â¥â¥ load of hackers/Triggerbotters -Heavily pay-to-get worthy things but not necessarily pay to win because most ARMAS guns are reskins -Bad graphics -Bad optimization -Matchmaking is garbage -Big health pools that favor central europeans mostly when it comes to ping so they kill you fast even if you hit them first and with more bullets -Small development team and a very greedy one. They do not even have an animator even though they made millions through ARMAS -Not new content since 2011 -Not solo-friendly -Not really a way to make big profits other than being a talented designer. -Silvers must play with golds because of the ridiculously low population -Combat is â¥â¥â¥â¥, hit the head or the legs, same thing. -Not really any new content announced for the future 
8522	0	a	On the store page it says free to play. This is the worst free to play game that i have ever played you cant experience everithing without using money there are some game that you need to grind in but this game tops all of them.i havent played much but if i play a game and i get frustrated from it in 1 hour then its a bad game in my opinnion,but give it a try you might like it.
3901	0	a	Buggy mess that's seriously in need of VAC support.
1929	1	a	Not BAd
7366	0	a	so I'll play the game wtih no problems what so ever. then i'll try to play it again and it'll say that a file is missing and the game can't start. i fun when i can actually play it, but because of this problem, i do not recomend this game until there is a fix.
369	1	a	i really njoy playing this game, its so fun, good graphics, good gameplay, and its free...
8953	1	a	Still waiting for that Fallout Online pipedream?? While it may be on its way with a- and lets be honest, long overdue announcement. Fallen Earth is here to scratch away those Post-Apocolyptic itching blues.
4741	0	a	Close to being one of the best games ever thats why i play it but there is still so much wrong with it 2 traniees vs 2 max rank golds with a OSMAW and Atac
3208	1	a	Oh my god this is amazing! The action! The excitement! The love! The scenary! The time!                           I got from uninstalling this
1975	1	a	I love the game, the easy symbol creation, the cool cars, the guns, the cars... Im playing this game quite some time now and i must say that this game is a great game! When i checked it out the first time i was like lets see what the game can do. When i played some time i knew that this game is great made. So now by playing it some time i became a fan!  
7265	0	a	Honestly, this game has gotten pretty good on PC, they are really working to improve the community by banning hackers, and releasing frequent updates on how the game development is going.  However I'm not going to talk about the PC version, I'm going to talk about the Xbone version which seems to be doing terrible as of this moment. I mostly want to talk about false bans but there are other issues I will address here as well.  First the game was super laggy and broken when released, which is to be expected. However it still frequently crashes and lags up pretty hard despite the 'fixes' they have released.  The community is â¥â¥â¥â¥, but that comes with territory.  So I personally don't play the xbone version, I'm pretty loaded on PC and I'd rather not start over. My girlfriend however, plays the game almost religously. The clan she is in is pretty huge in the community, and is well known for elite players who have way too much time on their hands. Recently however a rival clan started PAYING people (he admitted to it, the owner has a recording of it) to mass report members of the clan my girlfriend is in. Pretty much half the clan has gotten false bans at this point, and G1's only response is 'we don't issue false bans' even after posting said proof of false mass reports, they just ignored it. The man in question paying his clannies to false report, is sitting back, laughing, and bragging in social about how he's gotten an entire clan banned, and G1 STILL refuses to do anything about it.  This is beyond pathetic, some of these players have already put quite a bit of money into the game. So why would it bennefit them to mod their xbone, and hack in APB? Also why haven't they been console locked for modding console and 'detected' hacks yet?   Exactly, because there was no wrong-doings on the part of said clan, except they were rivals with another huge clan that just wanted them out of the picture, and G1 doesn't give a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what goes on in the community, only what they feel is right and wrong will be addressed.  SOOOOO, until they decide to start giving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the xbone, which a lot of players have now moved to, or started playing. I'm not putting another â¥â¥â¥â¥ing penny into this game.

10718	1	a	gone before its time. :'^(
2240	1	a	Fun and addictive game, can be frustrating. Needs more content, the developers seem to only add variations of content already in the game.
1737	1	a	&lt;3 love this game! Customization is freaking amazing, but matchmaking is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and there are a lot of hackers... 
6840	0	a	either baltimore or detroit simulator 2015
88	1	a	Personally, I really like this game, and have devoted quite a while into it. The patches and all do move along at a somewhat slow rate, given the small dev team, but I think its actually a really good game. I read some of the other reviews and I will address some of the issues mentioned.  Pay2Win- Basically every gun in the ARMAS Marketplace is a reskin of a gun you get from in-game progression, and the few execeptions have lots of downsides to balance their upsides. Anyone who claims that guns are p2w most likely hasn't gone to the cash shop and trialed the guns, which by the way, you can do, trialing all of the guns for 30minutes/3hours depending if you have premium membership. Really though, the in-game progression weapons are on par, or even better than their cash shop counterparts.  Hackers-  This community is so paranoid of hackers, its pretty much a given that either one person might seem like they are hacking, or you will get hackusated. Just realize that its possible that people are better than you, because some people have been around 4-5 years, since the start in RTW times.  Lag- At the time of this post, one of the districts, Waterfront, has been rather laggy, but they have been working on a fix for it, and the lag only occurs when there are more than 60 people per instance (excess people can move to a different instance to fight the lag, but sometimes they just don't)  Okay, and one more thing, its not as if you are paying $60 + DLC galore, its a free game. I understand this game might not be for everyone, mainly people that can't accept that people are better than them, and resort to calling people hackers or calling weapons p2w. Give it a shot, though, because it truly is pretty good quality for a f2p game.  
2868	1	a	Honestly the ONLY reason i gave this 'Do you recommmend this game?' a *Yes* is because it is good for someone who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row, *!WARNING!* If you own ANY Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row game's this is a 1 out of 5 compared to those game's which have a 4 out of 5. also all that is different between the good cop like people and the bad thief's are that they have different vehichle's and clothing. as both the cop and the thief you can steal from place's and even rob people really bad design on their part.   Okay now for the good part of this review.  This game is a extremely good game for the first few day's / hour's if you are a person like me you play it for 30 minutes see you can't actually go in any building and can't really be happy with the story, Anyways, this game has some nice vehichle's *saddly if you want something better then the starting one you have to pay real cash for the awesome one's*  This is honestly just a rip off version of GTA and Saint's Row.

4530	0	a	APB: All Points Bulletin, was my first encounter with this game back in 2010. I first heard about it in 2009 on a podcast I used to listen to weekly and they talked about this game for a little while, what I got out of it was that it was nothing more than a GTA clone with bad car mechanics and ok'ish graphics. So naturarly I didn't give it a second thought until one of my friends who had just gone trough GTA4 and its DLCs on PC started to talk about it just weeks before release and wanted me to join in and get it, I thought why not as the idea behind the game was cool... Well, the idea was cool but the execution was horrible, poorly optimized, lag spikes and a bunch of glitches. I lived trough this mess for around 56 hours of gametime before I quit, then just a couple months later it was announced that the developer and the game itself would close down. Wow, it had not been out for a year even, and they where already closing it down. Though as I can remember so had it cost a stupid amount of money to develop, so I kinda see why. Then a little while later somebody bought the IP and announced that it was going f2p.  Anyways, fast forward to summer of 2011 when the open beta for APB: Reloaded started and I tested it again, this time the game actually played nice, though still not the best when it comes to optimization and server stability but I cranked out around 100 hours before I quit again. Then I tested it again just a few months ago and it was still the same, nothing had changed. Nothing.   Pros
3278	1	a	Its a pretty awesome game! It's a lot like GTA. Only issue is the steering on the cars... its hard to steer.
6324	0	a	.
2901	1	a	Its a great action filled MMORPG. You can customize nearly everything in your Playermodel and your vehicles, as well as your loadout and weapons. Big fun with some friends. You'll love to run over the enemies with your cars or blow sh*t up, or just simply hunt the opposition down with all the gunpower you can get. Best thing: Its totally free ! Absolutely worth the try !
7188	0	a	why play a game that doesnt work?
9806	0	a	only play this game if you hate yourself!
5889	0	a	very bad game very stupid car handling i dont want to see it again on my pc
908	1	a	  It's really the little things that ruin this game, it's so good but so bad. Every time I play this game I can't help but think that maybe, just maybe g1 and reloaded would care enough to make this game what it was supposed to be. I recommend this game to anyone who loves customization. The gameplay is nice too and the community is split between real nice people and the ones who are salty as hell. In the end, just give it a try it's free after all. ^u^
820	1	a	cooool game Action
3230	1	a	Started the game up, then got chased by a group of yellow cars and a yellow van.  10/10
7108	0	a	Don't even try this sh*t. I gave this game a lot of chances, but doesn't worth a second lossed on this game. Don't loss your time for this kind of sh*t. Belive me, you will regret it for a lifetime.   I will share few things I saw in this game, that will brings your so much nervous and also will 'push you away' from this game: â¢ The 'anti-cheat' system it's crap. Doesn't do anything at all.  â¢ Matchmaking balance in this game it's 'amazing' too. Or, I better said, there is no balance in the game. â¢ This game should be renamed to: Pay 2 Win: Reloaded. (simple as that) â¢ Engine of this game it's crap. Full of bugs. Everything looks stupid on this game, even you are playing on high perf PC, you will have lag, frozing, dropping fps, etc. The buildings looks like cardboard box from some low-budget cartoon. â¢ Lot of unnecessary and unclear informations on the screen and everywhere in the APB World. â¢ The red-cross hit symbol means that you hit the target...NOPE, that means you hit everything in front of your target, but not him.  Recommendation: Don't try this game ever! That's why they made this game free. Better collect money and buy GTA V. It worth buying and playing that game online.
10373	0	a	Client/Downloader is janky as balls.  2 hours restarting, re-cleaning, verifying, starting again just to try and get the install working... Nope.  Stuck at 18% everytime.  140MB to go... Dies.  If you're going to insist on taking the game away from Steam and have you're own Client to handle updates/updating/installs, then I suggest you fix it quick.  Featured on Steam... Game is broke.
2110	1	a	6/10 Good Graphics *10/10 Customization -Weapons, Outfits, CARS 5/10 PvP -Takes getting use to  
2460	1	a	Very Good Game. Kindam pay to win, but still you ca have lots of fun when you are skilled to use the starter weapon.a
8184	0	a	If you value a game with a matchmaking system dependant on your skill and how well you play based on teamwork criteria, you literally chose the opposite game for those. The game is 1005% pay to win, prove me other wise. Connection issues are almost 100% constant. Developers have no clue what they're doing with matchmaking, I'm using a level 3 gun getting matched with level 5000's with fully body armor and maxed out stats.   Overall uninstalling the game was much more relaxing and rewarding than the actual game, I'd go so far as to say reading the Terms of Service for this game is more rewarding than the actual gameplay itself.

7134	0	a	LOTS OF SCAMMERS. 0/10 would never play APB again
3037	1	a	Regardless of the amount of people shouting pay to win, the game is somewhat enjoyable. The only downside for me is living in South Africa and not getting a good latency. If you looking for some gang related time to waste this is your game
3591	1	a	if this p2w crap â¥â¥â¥ game isn't enough, how about you join a real gang you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2553	1	a	This game has an awesome grindy mmo feel with a GTA-like theme. The only problem is that it's very pay to win but you can EASILY avoid it by going into servers for lower ranks so you dont run into high level pay to plays.
7759	0	a	I cant seem to get onto the game it says 'game already running' so i have nothing to say for this game.
2876	1	a	yes great game 
8624	0	a	So I decided to change my old review since its been some years and the game had updates. But sadly the only updates were box updates. Not really anything fun to do except have some awesome looking customizations to anything. You can get sniped by a pistol from miles away, unload a whole clip on someone do no damge. So many funny things that will make you question what is life. Just play the game and expect having cool customizations. Don't expect anything else.
5330	0	a	Could not load it...I do like it but just could not play it.
9635	1	a	its an awesome free survival game were you can craft stuff,fight zombies , and do missions but the only problem is the tutorial sucks so if there is an option to skip it that would be great :)  
2582	1	a	Great game. But at times it feels like pay to play as there are some OP players out there with payed equipment though with good enough skill you can win. And the game support is actually quite good.
2492	1	a	Cool game if you are playing with friends, but it has a lot of downfalls. Graphics, AI problems, Fps drops and hackers...
4504	0	a	Pay to Win, all the highest skilled players buy guns, gear, and cosmetics with real money to get an edge against F2P players. Spawnkilling and Camping is rampent, community chatbox is complete cancer, giving you an experience reminicient of Youtube Comments instead of a real multiplayer experience. Teamwork is required but doesn't exist with most players. Playing alone outside of missions actually gets you more money than in missions with less risk of meeting a P2W player.  Enforcers overpopulate most servers and have an edge on players.  Server-end Latency results in it feeling like it takes forever to kill players, shooting them dozens of times to kill them. But of course if you purchase a gun from the 'armas marketplace' you instantly play better at the game.  While the characters are interesting and fun looking, the ultimate result in this game is disappointing, and the combination of cancerous P2W methods, spawncamping, hackers, outdated graphics, and repetitive gameplay make this ultimately an old attempt at making a free to play GTA game, and you will have better luck just going and playing GTA5.  For Character customization, go to any current-era MMO game and you will be able to find similar if not better.  This game isn't worth the time nor the effort.
9560	1	a	Its not best game and not the worst. I really enjoy playing this. If someone tells me its a P2W game, im not listening him. Yes, you have boosters to harvesting, but you can get them for RP (Reward Points). You can buy premium in-game on auctions (of course, you must have some money).
3738	1	a	Basically the entirety of this game:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  nwa â¥â¥â¥â¥ the police hq&nbsp;
10190	1	a	this is and outstanding game to play its like fallout and dayz mixed together you can get vehicals to drive horses to ride go on adventures kill monsters other people on the server get guns such as ak-47s but in the game they are diffrent names rifles shot guns pilstols and alot more
2391	1	a	APB Reloaded was honestly one of the best worst games I've ever played, i mean its so good. if you like good games, then you can start by not playing APB reloaded, its the worst game. but you should give it a try.

3907	0	a	Don't get me wrong, i love this game but...  Anti Cheat is crap, mostly Pay 2 Win and the servers are crap. AND dont forget about the Engine! :D  Just PLEASE, don't waste your money on this game until they fixed all those issues.
9842	1	a	Like Fallout but multiplayer :D
9021	1	a	One of the best F2P MMOs i've ever played, i reccomend it. Pros: +Fun to play with friends. +Better PvP because you need to actually aim. +Not P2W Cons: -Not frequently updated -Bugs/ Animations not Completed. 
4278	0	a	There wasn't a game my old computer couldn't run. There wasn't a game it could run well, either. I could have bought the highest end graphic intensive game that existed, and it would still atleast /run/ at the minimum, sure, I wouldn't probably see a frame past the first, but it wouldn't crash and it most definitely would run everything. This, however, is an exception. This said that 'This computer couldn't run this' which was a first for me. It should atleast let you play the game even if you aren't optimized to.
6273	0	a	Quite literally the worst game ive played. The best part was when i uninstalled it. If you want pay2win simulator here you go. If you dont, then dont touch this thing they call a game.
1776	1	a	He was a cop, and good at his job. But then he committed the ultimate sin and testified against other cops - gone bad. Cops who tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead. Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands. An outlaw hunting outlaws, a bounty hunter - an Enforcer! \nn/
989	1	a	I Seriously Don't Understand Why People Hate This Game. I See This Game Is Really Good! I Spent So Much Hours On This Game Its So Much Entertainment. I Highly Recommend Downloading It. But There Is Only One Problem. its The Hackers [Speed Hackers,Wall Hackers,Cracked Visa Hackers] - For People Who Hate This Game Cause Most Of The Permanent Weapons Costs Some Cash. Gotta Deal With Life Bros. - -Recommendations Add A Swear Censoring System - At The End All I Wanna Say Is No Offense To Anybody Who Doesn't Like The Game And Have A Nice Day! 
5136	0	a	its exactly like minecraft
3306	1	a	Ambitious, that's for sure, with plenty of insane customizability, but overly-high system requirements and unsatisfying gunplay will undoubtedly see this game die. Again.

5934	0	a	NO!...just don`t touch the button PLAY GAME!If you do that,hell awaits you!
5115	0	a	This game isn't dead yet?  Is it completely funded by hackers now?
7298	0	a	This game has a great idea, but just wrong developement of said idea. There are too many cheaters, and it is so pay to win.
1181	1	a	preety cool game 
10571	1	a	I'm seriously addicted.
2630	1	a	Really needs controller support.. But for a F2P game, it's ruddy impressive!  I'm normally pretty harsh when assessing F2Ps but with this, I'm officially hooked :D
9980	1	a	(:
6144	0	a	Do not install this geam. save your time. its a huge pay to win only . you cannot shoot anyone with ingame currency bought weapons.it hasnt changed in 5 years since the first company went bankrupt. piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8940	0	a	I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone, even people I hate.  Pros: Optomised pretty well for low end machines like my laptop that I play on usually.  Cons: Atmosphere is terrible.  Gameplay is terrible  Has microtransactions  A community with the combined IQ of 70  You get muted without warning for saying 'â¥â¥â¥â¥'  Combat is worse than anything I've seen   This game is the worse game I've ever played on steam, It's optomised pretty well, but that's because it's a money making micro transaction F2P game, go figure.  Don't download this game if you're looking for something fun, or good to play. I tried giving it a chance, and it was terrible.

10085	1	a	A really fun post-apocolyptic mmorpg that involves quite the amount of mechanics, however this game is not very fun solo, well neither is any mmo. I would recommend this f2p mmo for just how fun it is in the first place even in solo, I would of course enjoy to have more friends play the game and making it easier to find them (you'll be surprised how hard it is to find your friend). I also enjoy the fact that it has a night and day cycle, but too many microtransactions (of course) makes the gameplay less apealing to those who doesn't want to 'waste' money on a f2p game, but at the end of the day, it still remains to be a fun game to play.
7450	0	a	WOW, You name the hack, here it is.. shocking amount of cheating, And high lvl VIP coming into servers just to blow you away Most likley because they are bored!! I gave it every chance and tried to ignore the warning`s posted by other`s and give this a go..OMFG!! be warned DO NOT DO THE SAME.. I promise you, I deplore you not to download this game.. Unless you have every intent on hacking like most in this game.. then join with your hacking brothers!! Such a shame has great potential, But clearly made to make a few quid and close this one down like they did the first!! Cant give this a lower thumbs down if i tried 100% thumbs down!!
6887	0	a	The free version is very hard to play. You are dead, dead, dead and dead. Running through the city with simple SMG, then someone with RPG blast you from behind. And again and again.
7361	0	a	This game has the potential to be awesome but it sucks on so many levels. First off it is a massive grind, you have to invest a substantial amount of time into it to be able to unlock anything at all, even if you pay the monthly fee to increase your rates. On top of that you have a broken weapon system that leaves every weapon with an unrealistic niche forcing you to buy a ton of weapons to be able to fight in different areas of the map otherwise the guy with the weapon better tailored for that alleyway or that elevated highway is going to win regardless of how good he/you are.   The biggest flaw however is the ranking system in this game. It is absolutly impossible to play this game as a new player and have a decent time learning the game because the tiered ranking system apparently plays no role whatsoever in matchmaking. There are servers tiered for each rank on the list, but they are not locked for that rank so someone well beyond your skill level as judged by the game can join your server and will get matched against you in the matchmaking system every... single... game. It just isn't fun getting destroyed mission after mission by female avatars in knee stockings and miniskirts, or flat naked who have hours upon hours more invested in the game to unlock all of the guns and perks and cars and whatever else.   Game sucks, do yourself a favor and go get just cause 2 if you want a freeform driving multiplayer game, or world of warcraft if you want to spend hours of your life doing the same repetative â¥â¥â¥â¥ for hours on end to raise up in level.
4940	0	a	its a gta ripoff and like most free to play games you have to create a second acount somewhere else to play it 
1468	1	a	Cool
6861	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. The shooting mechanics are horrible, and the objective fighting is bland. For something that shouts out MMO GTA it just feels empty as hell, with the largest battle I had being two versus two. SHIITTTTT
5828	0	a	The game was extremely fun but it ruined my computer and caused it to freeze a lot. im pretty sure it gave it a bug but if you dont have this problem then yeah get it but i had to delete it and it took several weeks for it to get back to normal
455	1	a	Nice game , Nice dynamics , But the servers are crappy X_X
7632	0	a	Realy bad for new players as people have 2 many op weapons and you cant catch up
2656	1	a	It's the multiplayer version of cops and robbers you've always wanted. It almost feels like it's pay to win, but it totally isn't.
3720	1	a	Ok so I have been kind of addicted to this game for over a year now. Its my first venture into a true PVP game. The community is ok once you find other players willing to help teach you the game and play along your side until you get the mechanics figured out. The match making is pretty bad and there are alot of people who play in zones where they don't belong (you will have issues with getting killed alot and not getting many kills when you start) out once you figure it out and you keep in the back of your mind that this is only a game and you don't rage quit it turns out to be pretty good.
334	1	a	this game rocks
7206	0	a	This game has fun gameplay but the pay 2 win ruins it, if this game wouldn't be pay 2 win it would be pretty decent/semi-bad but it's not. are you skillful? this is not the game for you, are you good at spending TONS of mommys money to become an in-game stripper with rocket lauchers? download now for 'free'!
6347	0	a	Pay to win   not a really good tutorial
1634	1	a	Very cool game :)
3647	1	a	It's pretty much the biggest Pay to Win game out there. Is it fun? With friends, Hell yeah!
3790	0	a	APB: Reloaded has gone downhill significantly since it's Free-to-Play release. While it still retains a good feeling for the gunplay mechanics, the prevelance and overzealous pushing of the cash shop along with annoying players with 'subscribe now!' advertisements tends to get in the way.  Over time weapons have been tuned in such a way that significant advantages (especially in lower threat levels and ranks) are outright purchasable with real cash, and these aren't cheap. Permanent weapons can cost upwards of a full $40 if not more, but at least now they're able to be applied to all characters on an account for a premium.  Cheating is a very common problem these days, be it via hacks or gaming the threat/matchmaking system. With no real appropriate ladder, and the overwhelming amount of people who feel that if they aren't winning they aren't having fun; we find that more and more players will use every and any trick in the book and out of the book to win with illegitimate results.  If you can get over those issues though, and play APB:R without too much invested in it with a few friends, you can have an absolute blast be it chasing down criminal players or resisting arrest from enforcers.  The question here is whether or not APB:R is good enough to warrant still being alive, and that's a debatable answer.
7600	0	a	If you have money you can enjoy this game, if you don't... well good luck.
3949	0	a	As you can see, I've spent TONS of hours on this game. I loved it and I think it's an AWESOME concept for a game, but sadly, as time went by, the game turned more and more into a toxic waste. The community is cancer, the P2W is unbearable, and the devs are the biggest ***holes in the gaming industry. I have to say though, if you have a good group of friends or even if you can find a cool clan to join up with in game, the game is an ABSOLUTE blast. Again, you'd need to be able to stand hackers and p2w features out the Wahoo but it's an enjoyable ride once you get the hang of it and accept the fact you're gonna get pummeled as a noob.
9787	1	a	If you are one of those 100% completion types, this will keep you occupied for a very very long time. i have over 200 hours in this game, and i still haven't even left the first major area. and i still have quite a bit more to do yet before i will move on.    also good if you are a cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like me. all that time in, and i've spent no real money. i may not ever(sorry devs) because i can gather and craft anything i might need.   not for the impatient. some things can take a very long time(days) to craft, and only one at a time.
6054	0	a	This game is good apart from it takes ages to load and i cant even play it at the moment cos it keeps having to download directx
68	1	a	This is a fun game it is easy but sometimes hard. You can customize ur person and unlock and buy the weapons. As a COP and BAD MAN you can do mission. There is cars you can get and you can buy cars and customize them. LOVE GAME A LOT C:

6160	0	a	just buy GTA V  seriously
2836	1	a	Rating 5~~~ Would love to give this game like a 7-8 but due to Aimbots and hackers this game can give you a hard time. So when play'n you might have to pick this game up and drop it for a bit to cool off if you get mad at games. Yest its a Free to Pay game i.e. youll be just fine with out getting out your wallet but be prepared when you face a subscriber or someone who just felt like sinking some money into the game. Very Cops &amp; Robbers/GTA/MMO style game. I say make sure you try it out but relize you have been warned.
5515	0	a	GTA 4 wannabe game without the polish- effectively just a turd. There litterally is no purpose in the game, microtransactions. Not worth the 10$ in bandwidth to download it!
103	1	a	lol i dont even need to talk about this aids
4734	0	a	Honestly it's the best bad game I ever played. But in the end I'm sad I spent nearly 4 years playing it and almost 6 months of actual play time invested (that's 4k and a few hours) ( and no I don't login with steam often so it's less here.) that I will never get back, don't be fooled by the new paintjob it got with FF, FF is a s-hit anticheat and does nothing to save this game just move right along and play another game. Trust me it's not worth the time get good at a better or more important game.
4349	0	a	If you play this game without pay RIP or rather Rest In Grinding. Unless you pay for this game, you will find yourself grinding hour after hour. The customization is horrible if you are not a premium player. You should probably not play this game if your going to not play as a premium player. It was fun while it lasted. RIP APB and RIG all non prem players.
6331	0	a	F2P, Free to dont pay but suck it should be called. This game is 100% Pay to Win. Good guns? Buy them for 10$ :( . Well this game could have had great potential, but the greed for money destroyed that. Thumb down
80	1	a	Now I know my hours of gameplay for this game doesn't say much, but hear me out anyways.  APB:R is an open world MMO where the players could either be the criminals or the enforcers. The roles are quite self-explainatory   The gameplay itself is quite what you would expect from any other third-person game, run to cover, peep out, unload your guns, that or you could just jump out and spray your munition and pray that it lands on the target. The gameplay however isn't what fascinates me, it is the customization option that you apply to your ride or your player model. You can create your very own designs from scratch, whether or not it ends up as tattoo or a car decal, the endless possiblity of creation is simply just mind blowing (Provided that you unlock all the customization option). As someone who studies graphic designs, this is my nice cup of tea.   Note: Premium players can put in more customization items on their clothings/car/tattoos compared to f2p players.  Of course, since this is a free to play game there are in-game items that you can buy to give you an edge against your opposition. Personally however, I think this game is still reasonable even if you are a f2p player.  The only downside for me is probaly the community inside the game. I'm not sure about the other servers, but the server I'm currently residing in is just..just.... full of twelve years old who are uncapable of listening to reason and logic. Oh yeah. Also expect â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Lots and lots of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
5564	0	a	Every time I play this game, I feel a tickle in my taint. So I guess this game is comparable to gonorrhea.
1351	1	a	This is ma Game
876	1	a	Overall its a pretty epic and unique Pvp open world game. Dont listen to all people that try to make it look bad just because they dont know how to be good at the game.  Its not pay2win! U can beat armas weapons very good with non cash weapons. The best weapons like Ntec, PMG, OCA and HVR are all FREE FOR IN GAME MONEY at contacts.  It just takes much time to learn the game (map knowledge, tactics, weapon control and more).   And its also NOT full of cheaters. Of course there are cheaters but its not even half that worse like in many other f2p games. This Game uses Fairfight Anti Cheat. Fairfight monitores how someone is playing (Check  FFBANS.ORG  to see most banned players from APB).  The customization possibilities of APB are just unique. U can almost make every design you want on your cars and clothing :) (Thats why it needs this high amount of RAM) Well about performance its not very optimized because its a old unreal engine version very heavy modified.  Engine upgrade for PC should come after they released the Ps4 version on which they currently working on. But it can run well at 40-60fps when u own a good 4 core Cpu, 8 GB of Ram (its waaay more CPU and RAM intense than GPU intense) and a Gpu with 1 - 1,5Gb of Vram. Of course it depends on your Graphic settings. You can make more detailed graphics Settings with Advanced APB Launcher (search APB forums to find the download for it)..   So give it a try and start learning and u will see its just great.
3671	1	a	This game has lots of issues, like cheaters, buy to win, timed weapons ( huge BS but it's true), limited world, boring as hell missions (they seem to be different, but they are all the same, just team deathmatch) maps are also boring as hell, those towns are boring as hell, ..... there are some many disadvantages .... , but there are few things that makes this game interesting .... for a while, character creator, clothes creator (not pure, but you can make realy good costume for your character) and that would be all. It's not that bad for a free game, but definitely not worth spending any money for premium or for (give me a break) timed weapons.
133	1	a	Woah gta 5 is pretty fun.
7563	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
5213	0	a	The Game ruined by hackers!
7633	0	a	This game is lame. You can try it, but it'll gona be a dissapointment.
5343	0	a	It's bad.  Thats all i have to say.  The only thiing that is good is the art but besides that everything else is bad.
8464	0	a	I cant eaven start the game with these all errors game 0/11 go nahui game
1992	1	a	Its a good game and it has high graphics so i reccmoned this
2004	1	a	Not bad at all.... Kinda boring at beginning, but Nice Game, thats all ; )
468	1	a	Very nice game! Sometimes i imagine its like my second life :D However, sometimes it might get boring, but ill recommend it, cause its free 2 play :)
4834	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.
5402	0	a	I desperately wanted to like this...and then couldn't.
809	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
5088	0	a	Game is an overall mess, developers are super indecisive and destroy the fast pace shooter I used to love... Oh and the cash shop is still overpriced.  Edit in Sept 2016 - The game is still just as bad, no engine upgrade still and cash shop is their priority
7627	0	a	Banned by punkbuser for 'cheating' when I certainly did not. Poor custom support, NOT RECOMMENDED.
3620	1	a	Hell of a game. mugging, robbing, and missions. Own this now.
9755	1	a	This game has pretty much everything, except the usual dragons and things like that and thats the main part of the reason i like the game, im so fed up with RPGs always being some kind of D&amp;D spinoff.  I joined FE when it was still rather new and the seamless huge world in which it takes place, really appealed to me.  At some point though, this game went F2P instead of subscription based as it used to be and thats about when i stopped playing, because it became much like the channel packages u get u choose from at ur cable provider, where the basic setting contains all the crappy channels and the channels u really want, only comes in a bundle where u pay for 5 channels to get that single channel u actually do want.  I liked it better when FE was subsctription based, everyone contributed the same and everyone was equally set in the world of FE, no one had special advantages and the same amount of in-game effort, would earn anyone the same amount of gain.  Apart from that, the game has a ton of hrs of fun, especially if u team up with other players and maybe even join or found a clan.  The crafting system is brilliant, crafting takes quite some time (unless they changed it since i played that is), i recall it taking like 2 or 3 rl minutes to make a bandage and 10 mins to craft a small batch of ammo.  Crafting things like mounts, may take up to several days depending on the level of the mount and while that may seem like a lot, it soon becomes very natural in the game as u dont find urself waiting around for crafts to complete, because u actually learn to plan ur crafting and that becomes a part of the game that contributes to full experience in a very good way.  There are safe areas where other players wont be able to attack u and that makes it possible to settle as a crafter/merchant with little or no fighting skills and as u can have more chrs, u can do good by building a 'money farmer' to supply ur fighter chr with money.  Missions are good and works well and u are free to complete the missions over and over again to farm special drops, xp etc.   Beware that like i said, its been quite some time since i stopped playing and some things may have changed. The only change im pretty sure of that hasnt happend but has been awaited since the game came out, is player housing, that part unfortunately doesnt exist, so everything u gather in game will have to be stored in 'vaults'.  The vault system works well though, its put together of different vault types where some vaults appear more often than others, so the stuff u need the most, will have to go into the standard vault in order to be easily accessed from 'anywhere'.  The vaults has a fixed amount of slots and ofc u can buy more slots by paying money, but at least (afaik) its still a one time fee.  When u pay real money, u can get your xp gain furthered and basically it means, if u wanna level at a descent and not too boring speed, u will have to pay and so it goes for other things as well.  Id still vote that this game goes back to subscription based, so that a good handfull of the players wont have to pay for all of those who play for free.  The only good thing about F2P is that u get to try before u buy, but that couldve been achieved with a normal demo, i seem to recall that when i joined FE, it had a demo that allowed u to play until u reached level 15 or so, after that u couldnt level any further.  Playing until level 15 were more than enough to decide whether to buy the game or not.
8865	0	a	Not worth the install in my opinion. When you look at this you think 'COOL! AN MMORPG JUST LIKE FALLOUT!' What you get: Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.
1649	1	a	Kind of like GTA Online.
4227	0	a	I could not register an account because there was a add covering the create account button that i could not exit out of.
2036	1	a	its has a good driveing as well as real life and you can get cooler looking &gt;:D
2841	1	a	I like to describe this game as basically, 'Multiplayer Grand Theft Auto'. You're in a large scale city environment with traffic, NPCs, and other players and it's third person shooter style. The storyline behind the game makes it somewhat believable: the city has deteriorated and crime is rampant. In a last ditch effort to save the city the mayor deputizes anyone who wants to help enforce laws, thus the creation of the two major factions enforcers and criminals. Characters are grouped (typically groups of 2-4 or up to 8 if you call in backup) to help each other with missions that are assigned by a dispatcher depending on their faction. You can create your own groups with friends or be auto grouped. Firefights run rampant and most are really enjoyable to partake in. But it's the endless amount of customization you can do to your character, music, and vehicles, that makes this game shine. If you can dream it, then you pretty much can create it with all the different ingame editors.
36	1	a	No matter what team you choose, you will get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked unless you have a lot of luck.  This is one of those games where it's a LOT more fun with friends, without them all you have is trying to make friends, missions, etc etc.   Another thing you hear a lot about. Hackers. Lots of them. Or just really good players.  Overall:  Melon/10
7964	0	a	Pay to win! **** YOU!!!
9380	0	a	poor graphix would acceptable with a free game if the controls didnt suck especially hard.
5932	0	a	Best part is when you are going to click the uninstall button!
1582	1	a	Very fun to play, lot's of nice people and cool character customisations. Highly recommended!
9537	0	a	It's kinda... 'Eh'
5437	0	a	Unless you like people that are literal bullet sponges, don't play. Its 3rd person call of duty with a not so GTA twist. Save your hardrive space.
2106	1	a	i wish the game had less standards to be useable like it should have a lower video card option and graphics card but other wise i love it
10627	1	a	A graphically appealing sequel to the Tribes franchise. Gameplay is top notch but still not as great as Tribes 2. PLAY IT!
2646	1	a	This is a awsome game if u like being a cop or a robber because this games has what u need
6788	0	a	For some reason one day i joined and i kept disconnecting after 5 sec of the game,someone fix it cause i would really like to go back to the game with my teamates
4456	0	a	Got money? Play this 'Free' game. :D
3622	1	a	This game is so recommende if you wanna have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun 
6474	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
7844	0	a	I don't reccomend as it is right now. But for those of you who were with it when the beta began, it's hard to get away from. It's like watching the beautiful development of a piece of art, only for it to break down, get handed to someone else, and tarnished. People now look at it like, 'what is that', we look back and say 'something that used to be good.' Problems with the game- -EVERYTHING YOU MAKE WITH THEIR CUSTOMIZATION TOOLS BELONGS TO THE COMPANY-THIS INCLUDES ORIGINAL DECALS, SONGS, CARS AND CLOTHING DESIGNS-WATCH WHAT YOU CREATE. ONCE IT'S SAVED, IT'S LOST. YOU CANNOT USE SAID DESIGN, DECAL, SONG IN ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL USE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. -Overpriced clothing on the market-We asked for new clothes to wear, they gave us what we wanted-with a price of course(we've got 2 new contacts(what allows players to level up) that have yet to be released, and it was because they 'didn't have enough stuff made for them yet'.) -Graphics are CPU heavy, not GPU heavy. -RAM monster -Ingame matchmaking has yet to be fixed, higher skilled players stomping lower skilled players in the lower skilled players servers. -ARMAS(the commercial store for the game) prices are way too high and misaligned. -Old assets from the previous game before it was revived are refixed and brought back as products on armas for even higher prices. -Servers tend to blank out every now and then. -sub-par cheat detection services. Meaning you'll see cheaters a bit more than usual compared to other games.(its literally the standard punkbuster package. )  Pros- -Ridiculous replayability-Like I said, I've been around since the beta when the game relaunched. And it's got me hooked because I know how the game played before all this stuff started happening. Still trying to walk away from it, but it's a hard battle. -Full Customizaiton-Provided you pay the dough for about 180 dollars per year worth of 'Premium Membership'. Without it, you'll get a taste of said customization. -Unique gameplay-Yes, it's a shootemup, but it's different-The city is your waiting and matchmaking lobby, and your battlefield. -Everyone is different, and has their own unique identity, unlike other MMOs.  And that's about it. new guys, turn around and walk away, maybe come back at the end of the year, things might get fixed then. Old guys, lets try to get the hell outta here.  EDIT-I forgot one more con, the community can spew enough drama to run a spanish soap opera out of business at certain times. So If you do decide to play this game, walk in with a thick skull and be prepared to deflect some crap.
8376	0	a	I've put a few weeks into this game.  The missions are good and varied. The customization is pretty decent as well. Though, a LOT of customization options are behind a pay wall in the ARMAS marketplace, which is overpriced as â¥â¥â¥â¥. The combat comes down to gear. The Meta is spam and pray. SMGs, Assault Rifles, RPGs, and grenades. Being outgeared is a common issue. If one person has a better gun than the rest of your team your team is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Hit detection isn't pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, getting hit behind walls and cars is common.  I wouldn't recommend this game for anything but the customization. That's the best part of this game, and it's a grind to get anything worth customizing.
7001	0	a	It is a pain to download!
4330	0	a	a weird version of gta. not much fun. a lot of annoying pop ups saying: you need new jeans click here to buy new jeans for your character. to buy things you pay with your own money and everything you need to buy so not really good.
7484	0	a	This game is unique and addictive. It's like GTA, just that it has smaller maps. The gameplay is a lot batter and the customization is epic. Back when it came out i would recommend this game, but not anymore. I am not saying that all the things GamersFirst did were bad, but a lot of them were. Now let's go to the sad part. It has unbalanced missions and weapons, bad spawns, matchmaking, community and it contains lot's of bugs, that are not getting fixed. Marketplace is too expensive, the servers are unstable and are sometimes being ddosed. When that happens the ms jumps over 150, makes it unplayable. They are not adding any new stuff to the game that they promised long ago (like new contacts, free content) nor are they listening to community wishes. The engine upgrade has been in making for eva and they keep postponing the date of its release!  The game has been in a really bad shape for a long time and considering what have we the community seen so far, there is no chance it will get any better anytime soon, maybe never who knows....
6433	0	a	Bugs and crashes is what makes it the worst.
9321	0	a	It's exactly as if they took all the bad parts and mechanics of fallout and packed it into a game.
9606	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME CAUSE I WILL GUIDE YOU TO PLAY LIKE A PRO
3599	1	a	i only played this because of criken
4121	0	a	Played this game religiously when it was with RTW... played it religiously when it was Reloaded and in CB, all the way until last year.  PROS - #1 They have fixed the game balancing where you can get semi fair matches  #2 As long as you understand the range and effectiveness of your weapon and the enemies... you can get kills... wins however, is another animal  #3 even still to today's standards, graphics aren't bad, and it handles well CONS - #1 LAG SPIKES GALORE  #2 HACKERS GALORE  #3 NOT NOOBY FRIENDLY  #4 BANS ARE APLENTY EVEN TO LEGIT PLAYERS WITH GOD SKILLS... if you show that you are better than 60% of the community, they will ban you quick  #5: COMMUNITY ARE TROLLS!
3728	1	a	APB is a game that has been around for quite a while on steam, its kept standards but has dissapointed at certain times. However i was and am willing to overlook this because of the freedom i gain by playing APB and how it can be enjoyed not only by just playing the game, but researching into events and new fun things to try! :D  Defintley recommend this game. :)
10174	0	a	Since I have not played any of the Fallout games, I will not be making any comparisons to Fallen Earth. After playing this for a while, I thought this is a neat concept, but sadly fely this was a wasted opportunity to make a good mmo. First off, it runs like crap on low end computers and overall it felt really boing after a while. I'm pretty sure there are settings to boost performance, but either way, there really isn't all that much to do besides exploring the environment, which happens to be mostly flat desert until you are able to travel far away from the starting area and crafting weapons. Combat is dull as a sack of bricks so you can forget trying pvp since there is no cover and all I have seen is people dancing around in circles since the range on some of the guns are really short. That pretty much sums up on what I have to say about this game so if you like walikng around looking at terrain with occasional crafting then fine, but otherwise your time is better spent on something else.
606	1	a	Must playe de apebe

10604	1	a	One of the best FPS games out there. Plus it's free
5725	0	a	APB had me stoked when I first heard about it. Infinite customization and cops and robber gameplay with a little bit of GTA thrown in. The beta had me worried. Server lag, poor progression, broken weapons, unfinished districts and imbalanced and shallow gameplay and mission structure. But beta is for improvement right? Unfortunately the game did not get much better out of beta and it became one of the biggest disapointments in gaming. The developers went under shortly after and not much was heard about it. Until G1.  They decided to pick it up, dust off the ashes and try to improve things. And improve things they did. It's got more perks, more guns, better matchmaking, map improvements and even holiday events. Unfortunately the game is fundamentally broken. Server issues with the gunplay are still present, the cars drive a little better, but still very floaty and unresponsive. Gunplay itself is spotty. I have enough qualms about 3rd person shooters (seeing around a corner and waiting until someone is close or trapped somewhere to open up on them) before you start adding the multitude of imbalanced weapons, some of which require ridiculous time invenstments to earn, or of course cold hard cash. There are only 5 or so different mission types which you'll be going through over and over, all of which require camping.  And then there is the community. While it's difficult to look at any game and say that it has a wonderful community that will welcome you with open arms and give you advice and support and flowers etc, this game has one of the worst. Many if not most of the people in here are here to troll you. They will follow you with the biggest truck they can and ram you off the road during missions - they will ghost, telling their friends of all your movement or interfering from outside the mission with you unable to do a thing about it - and they will message you with some of the most hateful and insulting things you can imagine just for kicks.  This is still one of the best games out there when it comes to character customization and there is plenty of fun to be had with a few friends. But it has to be asked if it's worth putting up with everything else. I personally say no. This game is not enough fun, even free.
7599	0	a	Never even got it too load up
9341	0	a	The games web site Fails to allow the player to make the account in the first place rendering the game pointless

5018	0	a	If you read any review, you'll discover the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥. There are thousands of reviews that point out all the flaws, and you've probably already read them. So, for those of you thinking to play, here is a list of the different categories of a.sshat you will find in this game:  -Low level â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s: wear all stock clothing, but are suspiciously good, and proceed to teabag everyone they kill -High level â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s: wear 5 layers of neon clothing, steal their parent's credit card to buy 6000 dollars worth of in-game guns -Subhuman stoner culture: A group of jackas.ses who wear leather jackets with cannabis leaves printed on them. Are annoying and likely have never touched a joint in their life -Trolls: people who fu.ck around and try to offend people with swastika patterns on cars and clothes. Probably the friendliest group. -11 year old kids with Asperger's: usually have in-game girlfriends (who are secretly catfish) and blast shi.t.ty dubstep in the social district. -Chat spammers: Ra.pe chat with annoying and useless text to one another. Rudely ignore everyone else and type so much that global chat has basically become their own private chat -The Man: The one guy, wearing all stock clothing, with no customized cars or clothes, who mysteriously has a f.ucking OSMAW and rap.es the sh.it out of everyone on the server, even the untouchable high-level p2w nerds. -You: The one, single, normal person on the entire server. Caught in a clusterfu.ck of a feud between all of the aformentioned groups.  Sounds like fun? Of course it does!
10295	1	a	When starting the game: First impressions are this is a cheap game with no controlls, but after getting into the game after a good half hour and doing some major controll reconstuction in the settings this game is really fun! I just want to have waypoints for quests I havent put to much of my time into this game so far but is blowing me away.
6992	0	a	Tried jumping back into the game but got error after error after error trying to log in and play.  Don't know what you guys are doing but something this buggy should not be present in a 3-4 (?) year old game.
8167	0	a	Well i have waited for 18 minutes but nothing happen..
67	1	a	Three words... PAY TO WIN.
105	1	a	This Game isn't Bad,but to get Some Nice guns you're gonna Have to use the Money From your Pocket :/
7092	0	a	does not load not worth the download
2268	1	a	A game not without its flaws. However, when you have a good team together that is in communication, its a fun game, and now that its free to play well worth checking out.
3433	1	a	This is one of the most broken, poorly coded, bloated, neglected, newbie-unfriendly MMOs I have ever played, yet I can't seem to pull myself away. It's a mess that somehow still manages to provide hours and hours of ridiculous fun. I consistently neglect the mounting hoard of games in my library to play this game. I therefore do recommend it, although I would caution anyone that wants to get started that the game has a rather steep learning curve. The matchmaking is very hit and miss, which means you will likely get curbstomped for a long time before your feet find the bottom of the pool.  The plusses for this game are its impressive array of customizable options, and the intensity of its firefights, which can, at its best, feel relentless and fast-paced. The negatives are its bloated memory requirements, server lag, the toxicity of the player-base, the repetitiveness of missions. and the lack of administrative support.  In the end, however, if MMO GTA is what you're looking for... well, this isn't exactly up to that, but it's the closest you'll get, and for me, that was worth the time.
8144	0	a	Game is horrible, feels cheap and generic especially in the physics realm. Don't download this garbage.

1627	1	a	APB Reloaded is a free to play game that allows the player to either be a crimminal or enforcer, or both. With all the guns, cars, accesories, and missions, this game is something you should definetly play

7433	0	a	watch for tracking cookies on this download
5981	0	a	It doesn't worth even free..
386	1	a	Okay, so...I'll admit it right here and now: APB has it's perks. Customizable characters, cars, even creating your own theme song to play for the enemy when they get gunned down. You can steal cars from civilians whether you're a cop or a robber, and you're always wanting to get to the next place as fast as you can. This game does have it's problems, however: Shoddy hacking control means there is going to be a LOT of people using aimbots and 'legit' cheats, so expect to have several unfair matches, and even worse matches where you're against just really good people while your team sucks. There are some even worse balancing issues, with some guns being leagues better than others; but at least you will know which guns those are, since everyone will be using them. If you have patience, and can just look at the fun parts of this game...I heartily recommend you try it out for a little while; it takes some getting used to, but all in all, it's not all that bad of a game, since it's free...
5632	0	a	Game is awful. Driving I discovered is awful and I only played for 10 minutes before finding it awful.
9991	1	a	epic fallout like mmo
3625	1	a	An amazing game that that i wish i could play all the time but the lack of admins and increase of hackers kinda killed it for me. but other then that the game is amazing awsome costum every thing and tons of hrs of fun

6255	0	a	Wont even let me play,everytime I click 'play' it says APB:Reloaded (Not Responding)
8972	0	a	just downloaded this game today, and I can already say its not off to a good start...while it seems like a very fun game, and I couldnt wait to get into it myself..as soon as I started to updater, it prompted the login screen (as to be expected) and it gave me the wonderful option to validate it with my Steam account, just behind a tab that says 'No account data found..If you dont have an account, create one now. Would you like to create an account?' but behind it, you have the option to try and create an account just in case..seems pretty standard, and very easy...so I first tried my steam account, only to be told that the username and password didnt match/werent correct...so I tried my steam name in itsself, still nothing...then I decided to take a chance and go ahead and make an account for the games main website, again, a very standard procedure, enter your email and the password you want...type in the random captcha thing to prove your not a spam-bot, then opt in/out for getting emails and newsletters of the site itsself and the original 'by clicking (whatever it is) you agree to the privacy settings and rules' so I clicked it, and now to validate my email!....waiting...still..almost been an hour now and still havent gotten the validation email and I have already tried at least 5 times..if your looking for a good post-biochemical-apocalyptic survival game, from everything I have read and seen..this IS the game to get, especially if your into STALKER or FallOut, but so far..I can easily say, save yourself the hastle..its nearly impossible to get into the game for those who have not made an account or anything yet
5457	0	a	gta multiplayers worst copy :(
7653	0	a	0.01/10  This game is one of the worst 3rd person shooter ever made. The developers don't listen to the community and what the community wants in the game. The over-pricing of guns and clothes in the ARMAS market is rediculous (DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH REAL MONEY). The server lag is insane and sometimes hard to deal with. Also, the amount of hackers you see is stupid and made me want to hack sometimes. The only good thing about this game is the customisation feature, but you have to pay for a premium to add more than like 10 decals to your car. This game is extremely pay to win, if you want anything good you have to pay with real money to get it.  Looking back now, I don't see any reason of how i could have played it for as long as I did.  I will never play it again.  
10459	1	a	Post apocalyptic MMO. Great concept. Could use more work but the price is right. Crafting, lots to explore, lots of character progression options.
7683	0	a	So i hit play and all it does is takes me to their facebook page saying like me. HOW STUPID!
6328	0	a	Had high hopes for the game, and had anticipated it for some time, sadly the game wasnt what id hoped for, im sure some will like it, those who were leveled up certainly seemed to like it, but on my end it was kinda confusing whis is as deeply negative as i intend to go in my review
10527	1	a	how to be a tribes player on steam 1. disregard the fact that hi-rez is a seperate entity than valve and has its own community 2. take to the comments en masse and screech about how the game is dead  3. uninstall the game, furthering the imagined problem 4. bask in your self-righteous glory
3098	1	a	I'm going to try and get back into this with the new 'Revolutionary' anti-hack system, I can't say it'll be as good as it used to be. But..........I can hope. And it probably won't be &gt;:/. I recommend people to at least give it another go. I guess.

10587	1	a	This game looks cool!
7263	0	a	It was good,it's bad now.
346	1	a	Great Game!
2958	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
5894	0	a	Too many hackers and needs a performance/graphics update or something.
5669	0	a	Mediocre game. I don't realy like it. But it's free so go check it out i guess...
8531	0	a	I remember playing this like 3 years ago. And when i did, the game was plain up boring. The reason is that the game is way too pay to win - a cliche that most free games use to get atleast some profit... and that profit is way too off top and just unfair.  Terrible and boring - that's my experience.
1500	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a fun game, but not without its flaws. Its like GTA, but better, at least in terms of gameplay and customization.  Pros:   1. You can customize pretty much everything, you can take a duck symbol, put it on a wall, then your character, your clothes, and your car, and actaully be unique.  2. The game play is supurb, there's no BS like headshots or or having to worry about your teammate running you over because 'lag'. The games gunplay is also really good, it is RNG based so a few weapons dont like hitting things, but other wise really good.  3. The game caters to a lot of types of people, more so those who can design, It can bring out everys inner creativity if you let it.   Cons:  1. Performance is WAY down in the dumps, heavy stuttering, and highly populated zones can cause serious FPS drops.  2. Server performance is also poor, the RNG and hitbox systems seem to hate Shotguns the most. As well as random 'visual' oddities that can sometimes be manipulated at will.  3. The game has been suffering from hackers/cheaters but as of recent, that has died down a lot. But sometimes, due to lag, you may see people 'snap' or moonwalking, so its sometimes hard to tell.  4. The ARMAS market place can get pretty pricey, $60 for one account permanent gun is quite high.   All in all, its a fun game, but only if you can ignore the client and server performance issues. Keep an eye out for the Engine upgrade next year though, that should nullify a majority of performance issues that we are seeing.
7991	0	a	I am going to change my review now, from the old positive to a horrid negative..  What was I thinking, saying how it's good the game is free to play..  DEVS - (if there are even any) stick a price tag on this game and remove the stupid pay to win benefits, as a new character just on the streets of the multiple towns, I decided to do some missions against the other people in which I would be sharing the city with.  I had my trusty Sniper which I infered did quite a little damage, UNTIL I did this mission.. I decided to take some steps back from the battle and attempt to snipe, I hit multiple times but got destroyed by players equipped in pay to win gear and guns that probably costed more than a CSGO knife, I checked out the store just to see how pay to win it really was..  I would never play this game ever again, I depise this joke of a game. 'APB Reloaded'  They joke you with 'events', the easter event was running round mugging random people and getting eggs, what's fun in that?  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
2768	1	a	I can't say I played enough to give a proper review. 10/10
5539	0	a	It would be a good game if it wasn't pay to win
513	1	a	One of the best Free OpenWorld Multiplayer games :)) There must be more games like this one..!!
7179	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
6715	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
4641	0	a	stay away from this game it will slowly drive you insane reason why im hiding in this can till this day
2664	1	a	very good game but only enjoyable if you play with a group of friends
7186	0	a	never loads my people
6032	0	a	WHATEVER YOU DO. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME. FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.  Literally came back to check on the game and it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ED by hackers. LITERALLY BENT.
3413	1	a	Too Costly The Dlc's !!!!
912	1	a	I love this game but it's pay to win. I understand that the creators have to get an income sometime, but they could atleast in the future make it pay to play instead of pay to win or do a give away for the holaday's and give everyone who does some challanges a gun or a car kit or something like that.
9031	1	a	After playing this game for 1000+ hours I can finally make a statement.  Pros: - made lots of friends, - had fun for a few weeks,  Cons: - outdated graphics, - juvenile and trolling player base, - balanced PvP? BAH! Forget PvP if you use rifles or pistols. - late game is definietly a money sink. If you don't pay, forget about the Alpha zone or later areas.  Still recommend it as a friend finding application :).  Edit: You can craft grilled prairie chicken. 11/10
6346	0	a	Oh dear god... this game.  It's so bad I can barely keep looking at it for even 10 seconds.  It's gameplay is terrible, graphics don't even bloody stand out, and the economy is TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE.  I can buy a HAUNTED HAT FOR A SIMPLE 1 DAY T-SHIRT.  Come with me, Haunted Hat, this game is 2shiz4me
6940	0	a	Pay 2 win. Dont even play it. Its not 'Free To Play'  Not willing to spend? Dont install
7562	0	a	Confusing missions. Empty streets. Definite pay to win vibe: standard guns can't kill the enemy fast enough before they can kill you. Even from point blank range. Runs clunky on high graphic settings, even with a 2GB card
4951	0	a	Wow...Not only does this game have a horrible 'recommendation' quota...  It also didn't work on my newly bought and built-to-play-games Ibuypower pc...  What a beauty to behold. I can not play this game at all yet I can still rate it conveniently...
9880	1	a	play this awsome game 
174	1	a	I would recommend this game as a FREE Wonnabie GTA Cops vs Robbers.  I must warn you though, this game like most MMO's has a lot of bugs, the most common of these is the 'General Protection Fault.  Other than that it is a Decent FREE game and it does have access to Premium Content if you desire it, such as exclusive vehicles etc.
4999	0	a	Its lame,bad,pay 2 win,buggy and the car drives like there were on ice
991	1	a	if u play this game you have a fat forhead
2905	1	a	Really good game having fun with it so much i recommend to u ;) try it out.
6883	0	a	The Unbearable lag renders what should be an amazing game unplayable. Tragic.
7732	0	a	Complete pay-to-win. If you think this will be like GTA you will be sorely dissapointed. Save yourself the few gigabytes and don't bother with this game. 3/10
2002	1	a	Very fun game, lots of varied online play.  Reminds me of GTA, but with a multiplayer aspect. It does have a pay to win aspect, but to be honest the starting guns are great. The only thing worth buying is the premium pack, which gets you like double money from missions.  Really recommend this game if you're looking for some fun filed action!  
9486	0	a	it necer signs me in even if i use my steam
7126	0	a	Gameplay is not smooth at all, and it is unoriginal. Well, atleast I did not loose any money, time, or my soul to this game
1809	1	a	Awesome for a Free game but you do often get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by ads to upgrade... but here's a little known secret APB actually stand for Angry Pensioner â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es. Plus much arousal can be gained from breast modification.
1470	1	a	great game to play, tho you can very easily can get banned or kicked from joining online servers, for doing the petiest things wrong...
3061	1	a	i cant download the game 
434	1	a	this game is great but when i start it half of the buildings dont load so its like an invisible maze 
4972	0	a	horribly optomized, literally took 14 minutes and 34 seconds to launch. too much water ign.
8236	0	a	7 hours, a total of seven hours, and it crashed twice. Once when I was customizing my shoes, and a second time driving down the street. I also died about sixteen times due to lag, as well as flipped 3 cars due to lag. If the game was at ALL stable it would be amazing, the character, car, and tag customization is mind blowingly deep. Made me kind of wish I had any artistic talent what so ever. As it stands I cannot recommend it with how unstable it played, but I really wish I could. Good game, badly held together.
2449	1	a	Boss of a game!
1208	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
2034	1	a	good free play game
10539	1	a	As of 11-12-2015, HiRez released a patch that completely overhauled the game and fixed most of the p2w stuff people are complaining about in the more recent reviews. There's no guarantee it will stay that way, but I do recommend trying out the game.
1344	1	a	This is a good game for going around and doing all kinds of stuff killing people mugging civilians it is like a 13 year olds fantasy.
2043	1	a	i is a very good game indeed so but it must be PLAYED FOR ALL THE GAMERS 
10809	1	a	Most people consider this game to be dead but I think this game, eventhough it's not getting new content, is one of the greatest F2P Games i've ever played. I love the design and gameplay of this game and I look forward to unlocking everything and putting more plenty more hours into this game. 10/10  Incase anyone looks at my time played on steam I don't use the steam version.
9536	0	a	I mean, if you want to spend $100+ on a game instead of something useful in life; then SURE go ahead and play this game. I mean, who doesn't like shoddy grsphics, a horrible community, and horrible controls...then yes if you want to pay $100+ just to SURVIVE for a little while in this game...go right ahead...
5331	0	a	so I downloaded this game and it says it's running when I never even opened it. I even tried to uninstall and to get my task manager to stop it. Nothing helped. never even got to try out the game..
6629	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks u cant download it it is a gllitch 
2358	1	a	Great Game 
6044	0	a	would be good if it could start 10/10 
8467	0	a	Gets boring after a while... You have to work for a quite a long time to achive what you wanna have. The only thing I like is that you can really put a lot into making your characters. Kinda like The Sims 4 at that point, but poorer.
8387	0	a	It's a pay 2 win 0/10  good guns 7/10 nice cars 5/10 over all 0/10  Always get matchmake against a p2w and its not cool
10231	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
2215	1	a	Brilliant online MMO and completely free! Easy to lose hours at a time.
8801	0	a	idfk what is this game...... it seems prety stupid to me
10534	1	a	Shazbot!  This game is really great, really really great. Fast paced, multiplayer. Free to play? You have to try this, if you haven't. And if you have, give it second change. I haven't played it a lot through Steam, as it has its own launcher.  
1682	1	a	Is Good Game!!!!
10297	0	a	This game is NOT what the pictures look like. Sure it LOOKS fun but it really isnt. SO glad this game is free to play.
8038	0	a	This game is very very P2W.  and If you don't believe me, go ahead, and you will find out that its very p2w during your first mission, you will have someone with a gun that takes you down with 2 shots, because he/she bought this gun on market place, but you start with probably one of the best free machine guns in game, and you have to put half of the magazine to kill someone, so stupid!
128	1	a	Very addicting game once you get to know how to play it. Everyone may not like it, because its difficult at first. There are some bugs/crashes, apart from that, great game (especially with friends). 9/10.
10473	1	a	IGN gave it a 8.1/10  I give it a 666/10
3305	1	a	APB is what GTA should of been. Best of all, it's completely free.
9463	0	a	Just not my type of game. I dont like the way I have to switch between combat mode and having to switch back to do anything else with the mouse. Graphics could be better.
21	1	a	This game was amazing in its early stages. It still is a decent game but my opinion has changed because of the market abuse. The game has turned to a pay to win game. I would still recommend the game to anyone who wants to get in a car with some friends and shoot at some cops or the opposite.  Recommendation: Play with the expectation that if someone buys a market place gun you'll be at a disadvantage but on the good side the game has a great customization feature for vehicles and cloths.
4791	0	a	Short and simple, about nothing in the game actually works  Being said, the game has been out for years and still has server and possible optimization issues  Besides the technicals, driving is fairly dreadful and the gunplay for the most part isn't much better  Missions are fairly run of the mill and will expect a lot of camping or just annoyance that the enemy has a better gun for the situation  It is however an excellent fashion simulator if you have the time to put up with the rest of the game
9969	0	a	The controls are really wierd to use e.g: q and e are the rotation buttons.This could have been a really cool game if it just had a better control scheme.  
2847	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
1674	1	a	ight game. 8-10
958	1	a	Action packed and thrilling! This game will keep you on your toes.
574	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
10630	1	a	Quick paced, fun. Only drawback is the Microcosmic, miniscule, reticule circle you have to aim with. almost non existent.
6897	0	a	Sorry but this is a joke, after many hours of downloading, it installed and started updating which was fine by me, seemed normal, until the update got to 100% and nothing happened, it started saying 'installing Direct X' which i obviously already have. After maybe 20 minutes of confusion i looked around the steam forums, followed some advice, but this time when i clicked play, it bought up the same download window and just started downloading something different. After this it successfully ended, however the game STILL won't play. It either does nothing or says the application is already running (which it isn't.)  Pretty disgraceful, i downloaded Left 4 Dead 2 without a problem and it works fine. APB seems to be severely fukced. I know it's free to play but you still expect it to actually work after the installation progress.   EDIT: Just found out that on this game you have to pay REAL LIFE money for IN GAME guns, games like this should be ended. Money grabbing bull****.  ANOTHER EDIT: So yeah since this i've downoaded many games via Steam, none had any sort of problem what so ever, games i've downloaded and am able to run normally include Rust, Outlast, The Forest, Next Car Game, Battlefield 3, the list goes on, APB goes in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ list with gaming atrocities like Velvet Sundown who wouldn't even run.
4131	0	a	When I've heard about All Points Bulletin for the first time... God, I was excited. It was a fresh formula combining typical 'GTA sandbox' with MMO elements. I followed every pre-release video, trailer and so on. When It finally came out on the market (Funny thing, APB was meant to be free-to-play from the beginning. As we can see now - the chance for everyone to play was only for fabricating the hype) It wasn't really THAT bad... I think that creators of the game condemned their game for failure just from the beginning. They didn't mentioned anything about the REAL formula of APB - 'cause APB isn't a GTA MMO - it's an online shooter with a really big arena and cars. Media and gamers called this game a 'GTA Online'. Back then, the developers didn't deny it.  APB had mostly technical issues, bugs and strange gameplay solutions. But it still offered much fun through customizing your car, your own character and shooting other people with this char. The game was fun to play, but had some unforgivable issues. Now, about so called 'Reloaded' version. ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE. After so many years the new developers didn't removed 4 YEARS OLD bugs and technical issues. Seriously. What's more - practically, they have created more. The game may not even work on some PC configurations. I managed to launch original 2010 APB on Intel Core 2 Duo + GeForce 8600GTX, but for some reason, after many hours of fixing up the problem, APB:Reloaded won't last played for 0,5h on Intel i5 + Radeon HD7870. Because f*ck the player.  The game is fun to play itself, but after slow progress it can get bored for a while. Especially when you fight those Premium players. The disbalance of Premium and non-Premium characters is very big - in cash, in weapons, in experience and so on. There is even a limit on a graphics that you can put on clothes or cars. Seriously. Because f*ck the player. Customization is still good, even after 4 years. What a shame, that it's so limited for a regular player. But you can still create something similar to your character of a dreams. You can slowly earn up for a car and car's modifications, but it is much longer process.  Driving a car is not very good because of server's delay. When you turn left, you send a signal to the servers of APB to make you drive left, and that causes some lags if you don't have a really good internet connection. This delay may be a bit similar to 'Hollywood car chase', but it's still a technical issue. Still not removed. Because f*ck the player. Shooting is k, most of the time, sometimes your character will not shoot to your crosshair location, because s*it happens. It still fun, and that's an advantage of APB:R's gameplay.  There is a good variety of missions, as well as arenas, so you won't get bored in ~15 hours, at least I was still interested to play even, when I get to know all the game's missions.  If you get APB:Reloaded to work properly - it may be a fun and interesting experience, depends on your liking of 'GTA like' games. Otherwise, you will get upset many times, for sure.  tl;dr Still fun to play, but with tons of technical issues and bugs, much disproportions between premium players and non premium players, try it out, 'cause it's free, darling, my final rating is 3-/6.
8920	1	a	althought it may not have good graphics this game can get pretty fun once u get into it :3  10/10 -  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.com 
9579	0	a	this game sucks â¥â¥â¥
5070	0	a	I tried loving it, gave it so many chances but in the end I just cant bring myself to play it anymore
5476	0	a	I don't know why I am reviewing this to be honest I didn't play 26 hours of this game. It kept coming up and when I closed it then it came up again. So this game is alright, I guess you could call it a cheap rip off of GTA. This game really isn't to my interest I do not recommend this game. I would rate it a 4/10
10145	0	a	i think there are some other best games that you can play without feel that you are wasting your time. The graphics are a little poor. The game remmember me like 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of chernobyl' making reference to the 'point menu'.  It will be a better game if the graphics could be better
216	1	a	Trueley the Best game I ever played. It is not pay to win because you can play with the preset guns and kick â¥â¥â¥. I have over 2500 hours because it so good
4448	0	a	Customisation is awesome! although the gameplay is slow and boring.      4/10
9043	1	a	If you like crafting then this game has it! Very indepth with a variety of crafting paths to choose from. The game itself maybe alittle dated but a fun time will be had by all.
10575	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews! The complaint in pretty much all of them is that the game was abandoned by Hi-Rez, but they're back! TRIBES IS BACK!  I'm just now getting into the game for the first time, hence my relatively low number of hours in it, but god damn if I'm not having the best time in an FPS I've had in years. Sliding and jetpacking around is amazingly fun, I can't recommend downloading this game enough. Seriously, it's free, you've got nothing to lose!
3636	1	a	It is a nice game overall and a really good replacement for gta. The games graphic is preety simple, nothing extraordinary. the story is not very complex but satisfying. The gameplay mechanics are simple, just point and shoot kinda thing. For me it got really boring really fast because the missions are preety much the same and the gameplay mechanics are not interesting to me. All and all i think that people that like the gridning kinda games will like it.
2583	1	a	VERY FUN GAME and now with steam the player base has increased by 3 million get this game its is very beastly
7447	0	a	Terrible. Game won't start 75% of the time. Errors...  Other then all that its goofy, Full of hackers, and everything cool or useful cost USD.
5501	0	a	Unfortunately an excellent idea for a multiplayer open world 3rd person shooter is handicapped by inherent game features that frustrate and annoy me beyond what I'm willing to tolerate. Not recommended.
1978	1	a	apb is a good game fun but awesome 
8895	1	a	  It's been 7 years or so, since I first started to play this game. For almost 2 years, I was barely surviving around Midway, trying to search for resources, never heard of Crafting recipes. Might sound like a bad joke, but truth be told, I was making some chips through the scavanging and buying new weapons, killing NPCs, then scavanging again. I was in love with what I've been doing, although I did not know at all anything about how the game works or where I had to go. In time, I was gaining a lot more knowledge about the game while growing. Sadly, humans can't understand many things at such a young age. It is 2016, almost winter, almost turning 2017. One year ago, the game has lost a massive amount of players, yet, Veterans still have the Fallen Earth blood running through their veins, keeping the game alive. All respect. I also count myself.
3523	1	a	This is one of my best games i have ever played this is the best 3rd person game i have played Best game ever 10%10! :D
5429	0	a	There was a time when APB was good. Until they let cheaters to do their dirty work. now its APB-ReCheaterLoad
762	1	a	Great way to past time really with friends this denf a squad game. c;
9970	1	a	Awesome game! You should try it 
2633	1	a	APB: Reloaded was probally one of the best F2P games I have played, but like with every other game hackers found a way in for a long time now. Theres been a lot more recently too, but APB has given me one of the best expriences in gaming in a long time. People claim that this game is Pay To Win, when if you pay you just pay to get the item faster nothing more nothing less. APB is an amazingly fun game, if you get a match without hackers that is. Although there is an abnormal amount of bugs in it that NEED to be fixed. But, overall APB is really fun and I reccomend it.
10374	1	a	Fallen Earth is an entertaining MMORPG set in the apocolyptic future. You play as one of countless clones with an unknown past and future, searching for more than an identity. With countless factions to join, aid, and/or harm, you the player are able to advance and change the storyline of the world. With countless means of combat from guns, explosives, mutations, psionics, and even swords and axes, you can find all a manner of ways to customize your battle experience. With a crafting system that will let you make almost everything in the game as well you can be certain you will almost always be able to make and use anything you find and/or see. The use of third person view for exploration and interaction and first person view for combat may be of some concern for some players, along with the need to explore select areas in groups, but otherwise, the game is easy to get used to and play on your own.
28	1	a	The relaunch of APB was proper, given the potential of the game, and the new free-to-play format is well suited to the characteristics of this discrete action game-style sandbox. The addition of new locations and the optimization of certain mechanics have certainly had the merit of making the experience more pleasant and multifaceted, and we must add that the outlay of real cash is absolutely not a requirement, especially not at the beginning They have high expectations and want to evaluate the product well. However a number of shortcomings is not insignificant relative to the controls, the feeling of weapons and, not least, the quality of the matchmaking and connection in general. It will therefore be interesting to see how and what APB Reloaded will be improved between now and a few months. As new beginning however, it is moderately encouraging.
654	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES

1385	1	a	it is a good game
130	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. If you like Grand Theft Auto but want a straight PvP experience, this is for you. There are NPCs who give you missions, but the missions are all PvP. It's still fun to play alone when I have some time to kill, but it's a far better experience if you can partner up with at least one other person to help coordinate against your opposition.   A wide variety of mission objectives keeps things very interesting. It's rarely a situation of 'kill all the cops before they kill you.' Jacking cars, tagging walls, hacking satellite dishes, stealing people's organs for sale on the black market, bounties on high threat players, bombing buildings, mugging people, stealing and destroying evidence before it can get into a court, street racing, raiding electronics and jewelry stores, fencing the stolen goods, laundering money...it's crazy how much trouble you can cause!  Customization is awesome. You can apply custom graphics all over your car, your clothes, your body. People who don't like the in-game clothing options will often tattoo their own clothing designs right onto their characters' bodies. It makes for a really deep customization experience, and you'll regularly be turning your head to get a closer look at what cool customization someone else has come up with. It is amazing.  I have one complaint. This game is most definitely 'pay-to-win.' $40 of G1C (cash shop currency) gets you an amazing gun with amazing mods that eats through all other players easily. So if you usually spend $40 on a game you'll play for a couple hundred hours, go for that since you otherwise don't need to spend any money to play this game. People who spend money will often beat you no matter how skilled you become.   The cash shop has cheaper pay-to-win guns, but they expire after X number of days. The guns you buy with in-game money all expire after 10 days. Fortunately there's not much else to do with all the in-game money you accumulate so it doesn't really hurt.

8529	0	a	I dont like this game
2944	1	a	This game makes me happy when i kill the crims and â¥â¥â¥â¥ u should play it now   pick a enforcer or crim enforcers make more money on missions crims can make money buy ram raiding and doing missions
9803	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
3895	0	a	This game is extremely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I regret wasting almost 500 hours playing this piece of crap.
8826	0	a	inb4 engine update was a lie
7	1	a	  So, after ~3300 hours i can definetly say that i am loving this game.  Shortly:  +Awesome designing possibilities! +Alot of people to meet +Ingame Market -&gt; Share of Designs, weapons etc.  -Servers are often laggy -Pretty toxic Community -Difficult for new players  Overall it's worth to give a try.  Recommended! :)
4806	0	a	Before I abandon this game for good let me say it's been quite ride and this is my final no holds barred honest review of this game. Make what you will of this review I am going to try and cover everything I saw good and bad, so you can make up your mind about it yourself but go in informed.   Pro's 1) Customization is great and you can do anything you really like, that to me is the hallmark of this game and it's greatest area it excels in, I myself did design and sell some great Bishada Rapiers when I played but it alone is not enough to keep me playing. But I reccomend it for customization options, and for that I give a 10/10 on the ability to do so.  2) Driving physcis is also nice, you have a variety of cars and how they handle varies by car and how you kit the body. However as someone who appreciates and enjoys racing in games this game has some really good driving physics, they did pretty good so even if they fail elsewhere this does help make up foe something.  3) Fight club is a great addition if your looking for pure action, however this comes with one of the cons that will be made apparent later, so please read further for the con of hackers/cheaters. Thr fight club is fun and challenging and you can getsomething you can use in game out of it if you do the objectives. Joker Tickets are something you can get some good stuff with but you need a lot of them. So for this feature yes I would say it's worth it if you just like combat or need to blow off some setam.  4) The car selection is great and you have a wide variety with many body kits, but these kits are ARMAS only and thus you have to pay in to get them. However there is enough of a variety of makes and models to satisfy anyone, though one shortcoming is a lack of motorcycles which would make for a more interesting experience.  5) The social district makes dealing with everything like customizing, selling, and hanging out with friends easy to do in a nice safe environment. Honestly it's a good idea to have, that way your not getting shot at while checking the market or ARMAS store. It is also the only area where you can go AFK and not time out from the game, so if you gotta go for an hour or two pop yourself there and go afk.  6) Weapon selection (non-ARMAS) is also expansive and covers a variety of weapons, however most of them are 10 day rentals for what you pay but it's worth it at times especially if they have slots you can fill your self with modifications. However there are also some real duds for weapons, and each weapon often is good at one thing but not good at another. However some advice, never discount your normal starter STAR 556 assault rifle. It is one of the best guns even if others would disagree, shiny new gun failing ya use your STAR. So IMO the weapon selection is nice compared to other games, as you can get a variety even if their temporary.  7) Modification system is also a plus, the various modifications allow for your own style of character, so to keep it simple this is a great feature.  Cons  1) The community is one of the most toxic communities in an MMO, when I did missions in bronze dsitricts you'd have silvers and golds playing there stomping everyone below their rank. Then they might say 'Get Rekt Noob' or something nasty and vile for kicks. This game has numerous trolls and A-holes who get their kicks in your misery, bronze districts are where most of the action are at but should be for bronze or lower only. Golds should stay in gold districts, and silvers should stay in silver districts. Also in social district you see a lot of sexual or perverse chat that is just distasteful, so often I ignored chat there. But as for more about this toxic community, I have been insulted and sneered at for even someof my hobbies if they came up in a conversation. A majority of the golds and silvers are elitist A-holes who like to wreck your day for easy wins.  2) Matchmaking/threat system is garbage, and as such makes for some very imbalanced matches that end up with one side having all of the advantages.  3) Small dev team means little gets done or it takes too long to do, therefore things they promised that should be out by now seem a long ways away from ever happening if they happen at all. The two biggest failed promises are the following. - Graphics engine upgrade - Matchmaking/Threat system overhaul  3) Hackers/cheaters are everywhere even with fairfight which JUST flags them and someone at G1 must ban them which happens more with the european servers than north american. If you want to play the frustrating fights against wall hackers, aim botters, trigger botters, and other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ go ahead. Cheaters are why I mostly stuck to ram raiding and mugging, to be perfectly honest.  4) F2P limitations are horrendous, for example as F2P you can only do like 7 decals on a car compared to 50 for premium players. You can do like 12 or so to clothing comparedto 50 for premium players, and so on and so forth. They really limit one of my pro's with these paywalls on how many decals you can use. This is a great sign of a Freemium game which EA has pulled off with SWTOR, don't get me started on that pile of garbage.  5) ARMAS guns are great if you can afford them, not so great if your facing them and cannot match them. Those pieces of crap can do much more than anything you can get normally in game, unless your skilled with your weapon type anyone using an ARMAS gun will likely wreck your day. So prepare to pay an armand a leg to get oneof these permanently, as inless your paying 2000 to 3000 G1C your just renting them for a limited time.  6) Map layout is a hot mess and each map plays itself to a certain style of play that really limits options, so if you would rather more rooftop battles use Waterfront, run and gun battles use Financial. However the maps are limited in size and some areas that look accessible are invisiwalled off.  7) GamersFirst themselves are a greedy company who only cares about your money, they do not enforce the terms of service so if that enforcer is camping the criminal money laundry and busting and defeating everyone who comes to cash out. Tough luck pal, they can camp the laundry and contacts with no consequences. Players can grief you, harass you, basically be abusive A-holes and they will not discipline players even if reported properly.  8) Graphics are quite dated and we have not recieved the promised graphics engine update yet, so if you prefer better graphics then this game is not for you. In fact they out a buffer memory limit on customization because of how much memory ittakes from the game to show every detail you put into something.  Overall I would not reccomend this game, it is clearly being kept on life support by G1 via ARMAS and the elitist A-holes who keep playing and paying into it. You'd think they would put more money into it, but they do not. I would rather play Defiance than this for an MMO shooter, or for another game check out Triad Wars as it may be more to your style. So goodbye APB, I will not miss you and I have given as blunt a review as I can.
5289	0	a	Pay to get better weapons  Pay to customize more on your car  Pay to Win  And lag as f*ck while doing that
3570	1	a	alright cops and robbers game, dont expect much, not p2w though, star 556 is more than enough
10217	1	a	Its Moreso fun if you have a Clan or a group of friends to play with. Alone it can be quite boring.
3583	1	a	its ok i guess... 
7805	0	a	UPDATE, yeah well it's good game in a way if there not was so much PAY TO WIN over it + ever high is most time always a camping noob or a run away or just dont know how to attack or always wait on you to attack so more or less, most golds dont have any balls at all or just only sniper wtih a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing noob nano or some other armas noob weapons and yeah i have been really good to play this game a time but now i only play wtih friends more or less for after 2 years this game is all about PAY to WIN now and no longer about skills X( it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sad and yes as you can see i have played close to 2000hours and it's more for i played befor it was on Steam so i say give one try and if it sucks than just â¥â¥â¥â¥ it side ways ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if you like GTA 4 you need to play this for it like GTA 4 in MMO just of cause you can lvl up and unlock things but you can close to customization all the way you want! :D for me it's one of the best game ever!
6755	0	a	I was driving my car and a left turn was coming up. I pressed and held A to turn left, and my car continued to drive straight for another 200m and then turned into a pedestrian and crushed them against the wall.  Uninstall simulator 2015 has never been this great!
8847	0	a	Just buy gta 5 you cheap â¥â¥â¥ son of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2749	1	a	Good and fun game just one problem, too many overpowered weapons and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, take that out and the game is great.
7256	0	a	I have about 500 hours on this game and I can say at the start it is really pay 2 win but later on the Weapons you are able to modify can be WAY better than the Premium Weapons.If you dont have money for GTA 5 and look for an alternative....Dont get this game it will cost more than GTA 5 later on but if you have friend definitly play this Game! Anyway a Dislike because of the Prices!!!
3719	1	a	I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years. There's something about it that's so addicting. Sure I have GTA and all that, but it's just not the same. It's a gem amidst all the other free to play games. Really it is...  There is a big emphasis on teamwork so grouping with a friend is recommended. Best character customization I have seen to date. It has its flaws and is highly pay to win. The matches are competitive but when you do kick a person's â¥â¥â¥ that has spent a ton of money on the game from outsmarting them and knowing the tips and tricks well damn that makes you feel like a god.
10262	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
8890	0	a	I truly want to like this game. It is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG, reminiscent of Mad Max but with a much greater technological and traditional science fiction slant. It is an FPS, with a proper akimbo system and a good variety of firearms. It has delightful melee weaponry in all the flavors one would expect and desire from such a game. The landmarks of classic MMORPG gameplay are all there: mobs, crafting, looting, harvesting, and all the economic factors that come with them. On paper, it is the MMORPG of my dreams, and years ago it was probably up to the task of meeting my dreams fabulously.  Unfortunately, it seems someone forgot about it. Development has stagnated almost completely, its team brutally eviscerated and scattered in the desert. It has aged as well as tropical fruit on the windowsill, no longer pleasing to the senses. The combat is flat, awkward, and crippled by latency issues. Performance is what you would typically expect from an MMORPG, but with some inexplicable stutters and framerate drops that you would not (given the level of visual flair and fidelity). There is an option for Advanced Post FX which is apparently vaseline on the viewport that destroys what little definition and detail the game actually has.  In essence, it has all the ingredients of a fantastic MMORPG and may very well have been one at some point in time, full of promise and ambition. It's such a shame that it has aged so poorly, received little in the way of meaningful updates in the past few years, and seems to embrace a trend of short-lived fascination for new players and long-term disappointment for veterans. It achieves the goal of feeling desolate and abandoned - as all wastelands should - but not in the way that makes a game something one looks forward to jumping into; instead, it feels like one that everyone is quite eager to jump out of, and justifiably so.
3178	1	a	Played...  Died...  Spent Money...  Couldn't stop even when things got bad...  Things got better...  Became a 'somebody as one of the trailers suggests...  Spent more money...  Satisifed with the 600 dollars spent on this game and the endless customisation.
507	1	a	Very cool game :D
864	1	a	The game is pretty fun to play with your friends but boring to play alone. It doesn't matter if your F2P or P2P you still have chance and the game is pretty balanced. Overall a very great game.
6821	0	a	it would be nice if i could actually play the game, when i try to start it, all it says is that the game wasnt properly installed.
4810	0	a	Where to start? Hackers, Team killers, Unknown lags (graphics), Money hunters, Bad support, Balance,
76	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
4775	0	a	normal agains cheaters game, best vs cheater game you can find.
8743	0	a	Such a horrible game, Match making is terrible. People with with speed buffs, Regen buffs, Health buffs, get put against new players and people without said buffs and totally wreck them. Gameplay as a whole is unbalanced, seems like almost all FtP games are Pay to win, and that the Devs don't give 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥s about hackers and security even though they say they do, they actually do not.  You might get lucky and win a game or two, then not win one for like 20 in a row. Or just get players who do nothing, or get put agianst players who purposely go down in rank so they can wreck noobs and lower ranks and get wins easily.  On another note, seems this game has a file integrity problem, and if your unlucky after a while you will never be able to load into the game again. No matter how many times you uninstall and reinstall the game, or repair the game as I've done. I am not even going to bother sending a letter to the Devs as I am sure they will not give a flying â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9907	1	a	Though it felt a bit dated even when it was released, Fallen earth is still a interesting and fun game. Can be a bit complicated but still fun.
3983	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
9128	0	a	Lets see, Corrupt Developers/Game Masters, 90% cheaters, this game is high NOT recommended!
3945	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs bettr then this game
6468	0	a	Do not play this game. It is riddled with hacker and the devs have no vested interest in preventing it on any level. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥in pathetic and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who developed this WILL NOT ban, prevent, or fix any issues.
2885	1	a	Truly a good game worth trying.  Pros: Customization on almost everything, Clothes, Cars, Your Personal Avatar Cons: It is somewhat pay to win, premium gives advantage over poorer players.
5760	0	a	It wont load up when I click the game to play. It just stops at the loading screen please help!
6804	0	a	have a lot of drive lag !
8169	0	a	How this game still has ''so many'' people playing it ?
4722	0	a	worst game ever remove this steam you only get wepons for 10 days free the rest you have to use real money with you lag like never before u cant play... so yea get it gone
4942	0	a	Its a good game but its a pay2win game :/
9802	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who.

1853	1	a	apb reloaded part 1 
10098	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
9136	0	a	Isnt as good as it looks.
7494	0	a	I wouldnt recommend this game, it has way too many 'griever' players who enjoy ruining the game experience for you, blocking your escape with their van or trapping your car so that you can't use it, ramming you with their cars when you are in middle of your mission while they are not part of it, 'ghosts' who reveal your position to to hostile players while being invunerable to any damage due to fact not being part of the 'fight'.  But if you enjoy being harashed by those who are bored or just seek to troll you, then be my guest and have fun at the game,I've played it, I've enjoyed it, but I have better things to do than vent my frustration to occasional cheaters with unlimited car carry capacity, one shot five kills weapons, servers being full all the time, and more over being teamed with low tier people who has no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to do and refuse to show or participate on teamplay and seek to solo it making it harder for the rest of the team.
2930	1	a	APB Reloaded is free to play, free roam game.  (i have played roughly 8 hours, so this one may be lacking)  To begin, this game is deffinatly a game you should try, it's a fantastic alternatative to the famous 'Saints Row' or GTA that everyone seems to love.   The game has 2 factions that you choose at the begining of the game  Criminal or Enforcer.  These 2 factions fight eachother to either destroy the city or rebuild and defend it.  The free roam aspect is done well, gameplay is smooth and there's always somthing to do. Gunplay is a bit laggy but manageable   Like all F2P games, there is a Pay sectrion where you use real money to get exclusive items, this may potientally abe a game breaker, as alot of the items are pretty overpowered.   There are also a heap of customisation options avalible to make your character look uniqe.    APB is a fun game with stuff to do in it, Deffinatly give it a try. 
10724	1	a	The game is very fast pace and requires a lot of skill and focus to play but rewards the effort with a lot of satisfaction. the game has a unique fighting system and is realy fun to play especaly if you like fast pace pvp shooters.
3330	1	a	Yea i REALLY like this great game
3457	1	a	Very fun game. I personally enjoy it, just being a cop is a bit harder of a job. I don't like the long loading screens, but of course, that depends on your PC.  Over all, very fun and good. Definetly check it out!
9034	1	a	This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.
2644	1	a	My game is broken but i have played it before and its realy good. 
6549	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor with outstanding lag, and a wide open map for you to get gunned downed in by ppl who put considerable amount of money into. If you want a pay to win game this is it, if not then dont bother.
8556	0	a	Take a good idea, make the game.  Then add pay to win. And then add hackers. And then add toxic community. And then add annoying devs.  There you go, a pile of s***.  But really, this game had lots of potential, fun gameplay, character/vehicle customization, unique gamestyle, unique lore etc.  But G1, just wow, how did you ruin this game at all?  Pay to win : YES! Game is P2W. Compairing the best weapon bought with ingame cash with the one you pay for it. Result? The one you pay for it wrecks everything. Weapons are not cheap, both ingame and G1 store. You won't have a chance (maybe a little) against a guy with a paid weapon.  Hackers : They updated their anti-cheat program. Did it do any good? NO! Still fighting against â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hackers.  Toxic community : So, you killed someone? Get insulted. You got killed? Get insulted. Left the mission? Get insulted. Was driving around but someone crashed into you? Get insulted. You did nothing? Get insulted. Well, if you want to stay away from rich kids, do not, DO NOT play this game at all.  Annoying devs : Sent few tickets, never got a response or got a trolling one. They see themselves as gods, if you say anything that bothers them, BAM, you get banned.
8293	0	a	The worst tutorial
5474	0	a	Lied about the new engine. Games run by cheaters and GM's who ban without evidence.
8852	0	a	well one i wanna play but a whol bunch of new players allways team kill of dont click ready so i never play   
272	1	a	Prety good game desipite some major flaws, like balancing, lag, and servers. Other than that very fun game and highly recomend!
4838	0	a	What I like about this game:  - Awesome Character Customization - Good Car Mechanics - Great Art style - Amazing Party System - Music is awesome to (I like how you can import your own music) - Okay Graphics (Not complaing)  What I hate about this game:  - Match making sucks BOOTY - Laggy servers, and website - Sometimes I'd be the one shooting at someone first and they just be like *Cracks neck* BANG BANG, Two shot me. -_- - It seems like the Devs don't care about user imput :I - Hackers - SUPER UNBALANCE (Although I think I just said that) - Takes forever for new players to get to max rank on a pledge because, they loose every single round. - Join last 17 seconds of mission and then loose (come on, are you kidding me?) - Trial on weapons. It feels like they are depriving users of ownership of a weapon because they don't have real money to buy the actual thing to keep it. I don't like that crap, and it needs to go. - Enforcers seems to be a little OP, especially with their pepper inlaced bullets. - No cap on what rank goes to what server. Like seirously, GOLD should only go to GOLD servers, and SILVER should only go to SILVER servers, and BRONZE should only got to BRONZE servers. I freaking at it when Gold be sniffin' up on the Bronze Servers. It's kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ move on the Gold people's part.... - Other players can't listen to imported music. There is no point of importing music if others can't hear it as well....
8762	0	a	50% trying to make the game launch, 50% loading screen...Only good part was the uninstalling.
1999	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at start and that is where many people quit.Later on the game gets amazing.
7888	0	a	the game wont start!
2904	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO AWSOME 
1861	1	a	really good for customizing but badly needs a ranking system and a better ant-cheat softwave
100	1	a	Hi,  Well it's been a while i've been playing this game as you can see..  In a resume.  A quick word about the community : You'll venture into different personnality  Some that you will have never thought to be friend with or that you would have never thought they would led you a chance to be friend with them ;  Others that you will regret having known;  Some that you will love with the deepest of your heart;  Be pleasant to others and they'll be pleasant to you otherwise if you're an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it will just ends up in like any other online videogames and you'll be ignored like a ghost.  -Gameplay-  A gameplay that you will never be able to experience anywhere else. Why?   Well there's a maximum of possibility to be done within this game. The possibilities of what you are capable of are the limits of your consciousness.  The character customization : you can make your own tattoos apply them where ever you want. You can decide to look like a brocoli with a green afro and a green skin tone by example.  Vehicle customization : Apply decals where ever it's possible in your field of view. Make it unique differ from the default style that you'll see in game. Make yourself noticeable while driving in the most well made customization. It takes patience but afterward you'll be rewarded for your efforts with positive comments in team chat while in a mission or group chat with your new friends you'll have created.  Clothing customization : Same as the others above..i've seen and met a lot of great artists in this game. Be kind with them they are argued and rushed by others to make requests and they'll get tired overall if you're abusing of them but other then that many of them are the most greatest persons i've ever seen in this game. Pleasant to talk with them.  Many variant driving style : Most of all the vehicles you'll drive in this game as a unique handling with time you'll get to know every of them and be drifting around with style dodging rockets of your enemies perfectly etc etc.  Combats: I've learned over time that you need to act wisely as you move towards your enemies. Detect their positions move with awarness of where they could possibly come from. Be prepared paranoy if you have to but not too much. Call their positions to your team it helps a lot.  Every players as a different style to attack their ennemies i'm the kinda guy to be sneaky.  You have an enormous amount of weapon possibilities in this game. You'll have to learn the time to kill of each of them. The time it takes to recuperate your bloom and so on you know where i'm going with that..  Overall with the game my experience :  I've appreciated every minutes that i've passed in this game i will never regret and will never be losing any of the good memories i had with any of you that might be reading this. No one will be forgotten for those that i loved and shared the most grateful gaming session of my first Online gaming experience. So many good memories..so many laughs..   This game is printed as a good souvenir in my memory for the rest of my life sadly haha.. ;)  Oh btw every games can get through issues but i'm glad of the efforts that the staff did to resolve them in an order of priorities because they have a list of priorities that can be more important to respect in order to stabilize the game to make it suitable.   I was glad to be a volunteer for this game as a Open Beta Tester for APB:Reloaded; APB:R Forum moderator &amp; San Paro City Tester. For the time it lasted.  I recommend this game.  Have fun and hold on might be rough as you start but with time you'll eventually get better unless it's not your priority and you're just looking for a good time.  iHope you enjoy this game as i did.   &lt;3

10196	0	a	This game had some high potentail, and it started out good too. Once I progressesed through the game, I realized, the mechanics sucked, and overall it just gets worse and worse the longer you play.
2245	1	a	microtransaction simulator  10/10 would go bankrupt again
2576	1	a	Great game. If you like Grand Theft Auto, you'll love this. Very great character customization, car customization, and it's just an all-around fun game.
8737	0	a	Bad controller mapping  Glitch and Laggy  Crashed for me a lot
5956	0	a	Complete Pay to win game. dont even bother
7343	0	a	Now I can see that this game definitely had a lot of potential in the beginning, but the end product is a broken mess that is confusing, tedious, and repetitive. The major upside of this game is that the character customization is far superior to many other games. Other than that, there's hardly anything worth mentioning about this game. My advice: Don't waste your time, and certainly DON'T waste your money on this game.

5882	0	a	I actually really wanted to play this game when i figured out what it was kinda like gta the mmo till a downloaded it was so hard to set it up and when i did, it didn't even load then i started to find this game a peice of cow â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't get this game
10096	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE BOMB! I love it soo much. It's a hardcore MMORPG! Its a good RPG because it takes along time to beat it. Ive been playing for a month and im only a level 8. Might seem like it sucks, but it doesnt. Its not like COD or fallout where you pick your stats when you level up. You earn AP for doing stuff. AP can be used to select your stats if you just have leveled up, or when ever! Also the game has alot of missions. It keeps you strapped to your seat. I love the crafting system. Its just so cool and keeps you looking for bits and doodads. You can also get cars, atv, dune buggies, and horses. You can get pets also! So far I have a Axe, Golfclub, air rifle, dual .357 magnums, dual crude shivs, and dual metal plumbing pipes. Those are my weapons. I also have a old nag as a horse. 1/10 scale i would rate it 9/10. Has good everything except that it takes forever to get a veichle. Also the servers can lag and some missions aren't playable unless you restart. I RECOMMEND THIS!!!!
7400	0	a	This game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people 50 times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. This game is not for new players or people who HATE grinding.   -50/10
8713	0	a	GTA but online. Super fun. Download it!  Edit:  I used to love this game, but it has been ruined by G1. The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.
9851	1	a	i can't login,so i can't get on to atually play someone please help. t
4917	0	a	I'm still curious about hackers/ it is a good game but there are too man hackers and they ruin it. How can I say it's Free to Play and Hack to Win, example Wall hack, aim bot, speed hack, etc.
6900	0	a	Bad Community, Bad Servers, Good Game. Don't play without doing so with someone expirienced.
804	1	a	Countless hours of entertainment, very good game, and it's free... what more is there to ask?
2965	1	a	This game includes a dynamic custom content editior in which you use too create all your own content; For example you can make a Hello Kitty symbol and place it anywhere on your Character, Vehicle, or Gun.   You have two factions, Enforcer or Criminal, these two factions battle it out in mini-games known as 'Missions'.This is a very team orierented game. I highly recomend getting a group together before jumping in.   Understand that this is an M Rated game and as such there is content inappropriate for children under the age of 18.   This so called 'PAY 2 WIN' doesn't really exist in this game despite what people will try to tell you. Most of the guns are balenced and can kill any purchased gun, given proper weapon skill, e.g. knowing where to move and how to fire.  There seems to be a minor hacking problem amoug users but, nothing too serious, The Company that runs this game(GamersFirst) does a good job at banning the big hackers. The Servers can be quite laggy at times and this is partly due to the old Unreal Tournament III Engine not being able to handle the game in the first place. They've added a lot of modications to the engine in order to do what it does today. As time progresses we should see an upgrade to the engine, so that is soon to come.  Overall this game gets a 8/10 for replayability and overall tactical battle sense.  Download and try it today!
8810	0	a	the leaning system is crap beacuse you have to aim in order to lean and it goes into a over the shoulder POV witch is crap i feel like what would make this game better is if it was both 1st and 3rd POV
3137	1	a	Prefect game, Just needs a touch up with Gun combat then it will be prefect!!
6748	0	a	I got to say that this game has became a really bigger garbage of game since i stopped playing it for like almost a year and when got back into it the hackers known as some of my friends were and are still on and hacking. This fairfight piece of garbage only do 40% of it's job and what else the premium weapons now come with a aimboot mod in it, G1 really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed this game up all they want is money from you but can't spend it on fixing this bugs and the game physics i been playing this game since 2011 a year after it came out and i gotta say it was the best PVP, MMO game i ever played i used to have no life and play it all â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day till it became a complete piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ 2 years later. Hackers started to hack just because of the Pay to Win situation but all though i have to thank G1 a lot for â¥â¥â¥â¥ing this game up thanks a lot G1.

725	1	a	Very good game. Really fun in groups and just do missions or mess around just ram raiding shops or causing complete mayhem on the streets of San Paro. Shame thing is there is a free to play type account, and a premium, which is better than free to play cos there are more features. But other than that, really good game, well, a good free game at least, worth the m....erm, i mean, free-ness?

10464	0	a	Super Lag, Not much point. Stick to Fallout.
8980	0	a	Let me start by saying the game was fun at 1st, but only 3 hours in i felt there was a lack of direction in the game. The missions of fun(for a little bit) but i never felt it was leading up to anything. +, there are so many controls you could just hit some random button and it would probably do something, which is so confusing i just gave up. 5/10
3577	1	a	Free and a worthwhile game for those that enjoy a good cops/robbers gta-esque experience.
4091	0	a	I originally played this game over two years ago on the Gamerfirst game client. I have to say that the game is full of potential and could be way better. Especially if there was more lore on the characters. Besides just being there some of the NPCs that you get missions from seem like a shell with no personlity. Like Double B or Seung Bloodrose.  The customization is very amazing and thats one of the key features that sells the game and that got me too play. Though I did hear about the game on a sims forum  After a while the missions get too repetitive.   ____________  tl:dr, I don't recommend playing the game unless you play it with friends otherwise you'll be amazed by the customization and then be bored to death because of the repetiveness. :D
8422	0	a	When i click play on steam it dosnt even turn on so i go on task manager to close it and it dose or at least it says it dose, and steam still says that its running so please dont bother with it.

3935	0	a	I love what this game could have been. Pros: - Fantastic customization  - Some fun concepts  Cons: - Repetitive and boring quests - Performance is poor - A 'Toxic' community - The definition of pay2win (Very strong weapons locked behind pay walls) - A good portion of players hacked the game when I was playing - Developers that just don't seem to care at all about any of the present issues  The reason I played such a long time was because I met a really good group of friends in game.We made our own fun and just screwed around most of the time. It's a shame that the game turned out the way it did.I know I would have loved it if it wasn't so incredibly broken and neglected.  Don't waste your time on this game ,because the devs sure haven't put any of theirs into it.
960	1	a	Fun game, although all servers are ghost towns. Nobody plays the game anymore which is sad.

6997	0	a	This game is full of ****. They rip you off of all of the money that you pore into this game. I spent some money on it and I never got my G1 credits.
7007	0	a	There is no learning curve, there is a level curve. The match making is non existent so you will constantly get people who are miles ahead of you equipment. The only way to catch up is lose enough missions to level up maybe after a month you can finally catch up and play with the good equipment. Highly recommend playing with freinds and not alone.
8701	0	a	WHY CANT I PLALY THIS GAME?? 
2628	1	a	Not bad for a free game however as soon as you start the game you instantly feel the pressure of microtransactions.
7254	0	a	I HOPE THIS GAME CRASHES all it is a pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥ and thats unfair to people that cant aford it why dont they make 2 servers one for paying people and one for non paying people
3653	1	a	5/10  Positives: Amazing character customization, great car customization, awesome music studio that allows other players to listen to the music that you create, ragdoll physics (hilarious), graphics and gameplay are decent  Negatives: A lot of cheaters and exploits, terrible customer support, terrible supporting company, cash shop, anti-hack is VERY outdated  Rant: GamersFirst is actually GamersLast. The negatives really outweigh the positives. I had alot of fun back in the closed beta, but G1 (GamersFirst) has allowed cheaters to stay in the game. This is due to the fact that GamersFirst makes tons of money from them. Smart on G1. Also, the players are constantly promised new content, but the new content never shows... unless it shows up on the ARMAS (cash shop).

118	1	a	If you ever want to play a game of 4 man squad base rolling out and hitting up on them fools. This will be the game for you. Also you get to create your own character and watch as it grow. But don't get too attach to the people who play in this game. There are alot of scammer and a lot of whom out to get what they want. Guns are buyable and also achieve through getting grind for ingame money and buy it on the ingame market. Its a fun 3rd person games to play for down time because its an open world. The method you use to win can be conventional/unconventional. You change guns and tactic accordingly to scenario.   This is a game for fast thinker and master mind tactician. Its like a chess. When all things come together.... its really is a games not to be missed.

556	1	a	In this review I will go over the basic gameplay and explain the Pro and Cons to this game. For a shorter review scroll to the bottom and read the summery.  APB is a MMO third person shooter based on the idea of Cops vs Criminals. Players queue for matches in district servers to do mini pvp matches against each other which take place in various parts of the map. There are 2 'PVE' maps and 2'PVP maps currently. The two PVE maps are the Finacial and Waterfront, each hold their own factions alliances in the district. Players either pledge to a specific contact to level up their standing with them or just play at random leveling up whoever is available.   Both Criminals and Enforcers (Cops) get their own specific gameplay that they can do while in the game. Criminals can operate burgleries by ramming into stores and storage units to steal the items inside,or robbing civilians on the street, then fence the items at their closest contact. Once the items are turned in the criminals are then required to go to the 'Money Launder' to collect the cash. Enforcers can participate in this as well, it is called 'Wittness Mode'. While a Enforcer is driving about he can patrol for Criminals commiting crimes and when he finds them he presses the Wittness Key, default Alt, and him and the criminal are now put into a mission where the Enforcer needs to get the evidence to the lock up while the Criminal needs to get it to the fence. This is a very unique system that is very entertaining and always present in the game. Enforcers also get a unique gameplay choice which is Less Than Lethal weapons. LTL weapons are the games way of making it more interesting and putting a twist on the game. When using LTL weapons, the Enforcer stuns the enemy and then arrests the Criminal. Criminals are able to free their team mates from handcuffs but only if they can make it there in time. The advantage to LTL is it makes the spawn timer longer, with the disadvantage that the LTL have a shorter range and require time to arrest Criminals putting the Enforcer in danger of enemy fire.  Being that the game is a third person shooter, the game is less about skill and more about placement. Covering corners and knowing the range of your weapons as well as how they fire can give you a large advantage over players who are simply pointing and shooting. The starting rifle both Crims and Enforcers start with is incredibly good, both in accuracy and power but it must be fired with control burst instead of full auto otherwise it loses it's strengths. That being said the game is incredibly unfriendly to new players, it has such a large learning curve that it causes most people to give up and stop playing. Because of that the playerbase is reletively smaller and all the players tend to merge into the 'Silver' districts which can cause unfair match making. New players should be recomended to play on the 'Bronze' servers until they learn the ropes better and are ready for the big servers.  One of the biggest gripes about the game is the cash shop, yes the cash shop sells weapons. Before you drop the game though you should know the weapons in the cash shop have very little difference compared to the 'free' weapons. Most CS weapons are infact reskins of the free ones, with the exception of the few that are special/unique weapons. One of the most powerful weapons in the game is also one of the first ones you unlock for free. Most of what comes out of the cash shop is cosmetic items that are for cars and clothes.  So now that we went over the basics and you have a little bit of an understanding of what you are getting into, lets get into the good things about this game. Number one of all time is, the customization. Free players are limited on how much customization they can do in the game, but even then I've seen amazing things come from free people. You can style everything from the clothes you wear to the logos on them, from the tattoos on your body to how fat you want to be. Customize your car, it's color, the model, the decals, the lisence plate, body kits, even interior design on some of them. Your weapons can be modifide depending if you unlocked guns with open mod slots. Do you like your gun shooting faster, more accurate, longer range, better zoom, better hipfire, bigger magazine, or maybe you like to carry more ammo. You can use mods to change that. Even with your car too, Nitro, Steel plating, mobile spawn, mobile ammo supply, or even have a brick that can be used when you jump out of your car to launch it at enemy players. Players can add mods to their character as well to carry ammo, be able to survive hits from vehicles, reduce fall damage, or even ride ontop of cars without falling off. The game has endless combinations and possiblities that you can take advantage of and have fun with.  The conclusion, if you can get around the very steep learning curve, get over the cash shop selling weapons and just have fun with the game, you will enjoy it. This game is one of the few games where customization is literally at your command. Dress as a business man, or run around half naked, it's your choice. Alter your weapons to your play style and make your dream car, it's all in your hands. The game is definately worth a try for people who like shooters, but remember that the game can put you in unfair match making at times. This is because of the size of the playerbase, the more people play the better match making gets. Those of you who just read the bottom and are thinking of trying the game, I suggest you give the whole review a once over to understand what I'm talking about completely and half some understanding of what you are going to be doing ingame.
3916	0	a	Awful game. This game was so poorly recieved on launch that the developers had to make it free to play to keep people interested. But that wasn't enough. They had to go a step further by making it so the only way to win was to buy weapons with real money. No matter how skilled you may be, if you try and play with the default weapons, you will be killed in .00001 seconds 90% of the time by a person who paid for theirs. That, and it lags more than GTA online, for God's sake.

2816	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very unique game in certain ways. Even though it may have low critic acclaim, it is very similiar to Grand Theft Auto, with fun car and gun play, infinite customization and tonnes of side-quests. This 3rd-person, sandbox, action multiplayer is a must get as it is free and quite simple to download. My Rating: 7.5/10
6343	0	a	Pay2win  dont play it pls
6685	0	a	Fun to play but the launcher crashes so much you will rarely get to play
8316	0	a	Low population. Like any games that are dying, only the pros @ hackers are left. Sad.
1721	1	a	A great Third-Person Shooter that allows for full character, car, symbol, and theme customization. That's basically the only positive aspect of APBR.  Negative aspects include a multitude of hackers and exploiters which cause for people to rage easily. The game also includes trolls which like to drive dump truck into your vehicles. Open world districts allow people not a part of your current mission to grief you with what's called 'Ghosting'.  The game is full of bannable offenses but the company, GamersFirst, does nothing about it since their ban policy is based on user input. Users need to record and report a user for a person to be banned.  If you have a weak control of emotions then I would suggest not playing this game.

7416	0	a	This is by far the worst community I've experienced in twenty years of gaming. This game attracts the lowest common denominator of every other game. Beyond the community, it's barely functional and runs horribly even on great machines. The engine update was promised for Q1 2014, yet it still hasn't happened. It can be fun at times, and it is a great idea for a game. However, the execution is extremely poor. I would not recommend this one.
4132	0	a	Everyone uses grenades , it has unfair matchmaking and you know when it has a pack for $100 it's Pay 2 Win  Update : So it's been a year since my review so I thought I'd come back and try the game and it was awful , nothing has changed and the game feels even MORE broken than when I last played it , when I was trying to join a mission I was put against 3 players who were VERY experienced , I've only leveled up twice or something but I was going against guys that were in the Gold levels and had awesome gear while I was their with a crappy AK and 0 teammates , yes , the game wasn't giving me teammates. I just could not continue playing , it was so bad so after a year I can say this , it's worse than it was a year ago.
9997	0	a	I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like 'Why is he even saying this?' Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it 
3872	0	a	Let me sum this game up for you in one (two?) word(s).  Aimbot.
2903	1	a	great art work, fun sound, well done customization
8596	0	a	One of the best games ever. Don't get swayed by the pictures though. Almost if not everything on them has to be paid with real money in order to be used, and nothing is actually that cheap. The game has serious flaws that need to be fixed ASAP, but are there for a long time now. The game has potential, but the company behind it is too slow to make it a game worth paying on the long run.

Pros - Variety of guns Variety of customisation of vehicles and character Fun in groups  Cons - Horrible customer service by APB Money hungry game No body cares about your opinion Hackers left and right Have your account hacked every few months and for APB customer service not to do anything about it.

2889	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME! this game is beautiful, you can create your own cars and characters, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT! APB Reloaded is one of those games where 80% of people have spent alot of money buying cars and weapons which are OP, this makes the game hard to play at times because you are put up against people who can kill you with one shot. it would be cool if you could choose to verse people that are your level and have the same guns as you, so you are not getting demolished by the people who pay to win. But if you dont mind getting killed with one shot well this is the game for you! It is fun to just get your car and Drag Race your friends or Random people, and cause Havoc on the streets with you Dump Truck, speeding along the roads blowing up everything in your path. I would rate this game a 8/10 because of its massive selection of cars and weapons, and the amount of fun you can have with it!
5605	0	a	WHATEVER YOU DO. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME. FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.  Literally came back to check on the game and it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ED by hackers. LITERALLY BENT.
343	1	a	Really good game, has a great engine and gameplay, by the way the customization is like any other simply perfect, i love it :D
4977	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.
10202	1	a	This game is all ive wanted in a open world game. its huge and stratigic and ive never had a game experiance like this. id get this game instead of fallout hands down. it blows all other games of its kind out of the water

8108	0	a	Cool Graphics but it's bad game and very laggy !
871	1	a	This game is not pay to win, people who suck at the game say those type of things. Also if you're even remotely good, be prepared to be hackusated. People just cant handle an â¥â¥â¥ kicking. I love the game. 10/10
7455	0	a	I can see why this game flopped. WAY WAY too much learning curve and some apallingly bad design decisions make this a tough game to get into. Not for the weak of heart or short of time. NOT a casual game by any stretch of the imagination. I'd suggest staying away unless you have tons of time to burn.
2378	1	a	it's free so dont complane if you dont like it.But i love this game free and it's really fun.The lag can be a problem sometimes but i can deal with that
10274	0	a	If you like fallout this game will be for you. A bad thing about it thougs is the crearing an account i have created an account and it wont let me log in after first time playing it. If the account creating was a bit better i would play more but untill this gets sorted i will not be playin this game again
4428	0	a	What is this? It's a sort of 'Cops and Robbers', where one team has to do an objective, the other has to prevent them (or they both compete to have control over the same objective).  On paper this seems great! You get to fully customize your character, your vehicle, even a special theme for when you are MvP or kill another player! A variety of weapons, equipment, and the open world style of the game allow for a lot of neat missions!  So why is this bad? Well for one, there seems to be little to no moderation involved. I've lost count how many times I saw somebody snap to everybody in sight, or shot through a wall, etc.  Another huge issue is the concept of 'Pay 2 win'. There are a lot of neat weapons, but the best ones are for sale with REAL MONEY. I could understand for reskins, but these are literally straight upgrades to normal in game weapons.  And in terms of the customizations? A lot of players tend to just make half-naked characters (no styling, just underwear), same copy-paste vans, and usually some kind of theme made to make your ears bleed, making it painful at best to play against other characters.  Loading is also a horror... If you go too fast (which, given the nature of CARS) you can actually out run render distance, and in turn you will be driving and suddenly cars and even possibly buildings can just appear out of thin-air.  Even looking past these, in terms of gameplay it's missions are fundamentally flawed. Forget that you did the first 4 parts of a mission flawlessly, they managed to win by just running away for 5 minutes straight after the fact. Instead of it being 'A does B, and C must stop them', it does that until the final stage, in which it generally seems to become whoever is best at running or knows the most ridiculous spots to put objects. This gives a team that should have lost a free win more often than not.   Overall, a great concept but a terrible game.
7857	0	a	Why cant i play it WHY!!!
1659	1	a	I don't know enough to talk about it.
2753	1	a	this is a great game,but i think u should have a X64 computer to run it well,because it needs 4GB RAM at least
2254	1	a	Personally, I really like this game. It is pretty much a free version of GTA online, but very fun.
4413	0	a	I Would Rather Take A â¥â¥â¥â¥, And Eat it Rather Than Play This God Awful Game That Really Sets The Line Between F2P And P2P
3002	1	a	Imagine GTA but free
1866	1	a	Nice Game , i play this , and is very awesome with friend , (coop) 
8302	0	a	This game was awesome back in the day. But now.. no I dont recommend it at all. +for customization - for everything else
5776	0	a	cant even play when its starting it just freezes and i have to restart my computer samething when i got it from the website if fixed i will try again for now dont download
9730	0	a	lot of problems with navigation, crafting etc. needs alot more polish to make worthwhile
6617	0	a	It looks like a real good game but the vehicle handling is very poor.   Also, it is hard to learn to play as a newbie. You won't know who's who and will keep running out of bullets. Other players who are a higher level will come in and blast you out of existance, because they have more powerful weapons. Most of the weapons seem to be overpowered, (only been on the wrong end of them of course).  The GPS is next to useless, so unless you know the map, you have a hard time finding your way around.  Other players won't let you play your own game, or won't leave you alone, killing you on sight for no other reason than you are on the side of the law / or the side of the criminals, (as soon as you've ready'd up).   My advice is to make friends with other more experienced players ASAP then you might stand a chance.   I did team up, but the players I teamed up with were also at the mercy of more experienced players. It makes this game a real pain in the â¥â¥â¥ and a waste of time to play.   Very little rewarding gameplay at the start, makes this an awful game to play as a newbie. You will get bored with being killed time and time again!  I spent two hours dying all the time and got so fed-up with the silly car handling that I am giving up on this game for now. 2014-08-17.   Sign-in - Sign up problems. (With GamersFirst). I also played this before when it first came out, I was annoyed that I had to go through the sign up process all over again, and even though I know my email and password, it refused them and I had to start again. When it came to my username, it won't let me have it, claiming it is already in use! (Well, yes it is - BY ME), but it won't let me sign in with the my original username anymore.  Overall:- a waste of time. I do not recommend it!
3406	1	a	nice game you can keep playing it you don't get bored
9061	1	a	Fallen Earth, in my opinion, is one the best MMOs I've played; the community is very helpful when needed and the GMs keep the help section of the chat regulated and reduce spam as much as possible. There are a total of 55 player levels as of now, im only level 30 so I havent really seen everything, but from what I have experienced, a very enjoyable game.    For me, the one biggest problem is definitely the client-to-client synchronization. Players may look as if they are in a position, but really they may not be there. You may also see NPCs glide across the screen due to the synchronization being terrible, but it has improved a bit. In the beginning, you start off with an axe, two knives, and three pellet guns (one being an air rifle and the other two being pistols). After about two or three of the beginning missions, you are awarded a horse for basic transportation, but as you progress further into the game, you get other mounts/vehicles. The basic vehicles are: ATVs, Motorcycles, Dune Buggies, and Interceptor Speedsters (basic cars). Each vehicle has many different variations that you can craft.    The crafting system isnt too complex, but it can be very slow; vehicles can take up to a few days to fully craft from raw materials, but smaller items, such as ammunition, can take a few minutes. If crafting isnt your thing, then there is also an auction house in almost every city; here you can buy player-listed items for how ever much the player lists the item for.    If youre someone who absolutely has to have good graphics, then you may not be too fond of this game; the graphics are pretty bad, but that shouldnt really be too big of a deal if you dont mind it. There are also limits to free to play players however, but they can easily be negated by purchasing any single item from the game's market place. The only limitations i am aware of are a limit to how many chips you can have (currency), a character limit of only one character and no access to the Global chats, but there may be more. In my opinion, its definitely worth it to go 'freemium' by just buying a really cheap item from the store, or by purchasing the Survivalist Package that is offered by Steam. I believe that the limit to the amount of chips you can have if you are free to play is about 100,000 chips. This would be 10 red chips and each red chip is 10,000 chips. Chips go by: Yellow&gt;Red&gt;Blue&gt;White. Blue is 100 white, Red is 100 Blue and Yellow is 100 Red.    There is a total of six different sectors in the game (The entire province is huge, roughly 83km by 83km, according to the Wiki) which all have different fast travel locations that you must first travel to via mount/vehicle. The game also encourages palyers to use roadways with vehicles as they provide a 'boost' and significantly increase your speed. There are also six major factions you can choose to be a part of once you reach Sector 2: The Techs, The Enforcers, Travelers, The Lighbearers, The Vistas, and The CHOTA. Each faction provides unique equipment that you cannot use unless you have a certain reputation with the appropriate faction.   All in all, a very enjoyable game that will last a while if you can dedicate yourself to playing.
1506	1	a	much graphics very music so pew pew pew wow
9945	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
3938	0	a	Doesn't feel finished, unfinished, pay to win, crap. Save yourself the disk space, unless you're really desparate.
3361	1	a	One word, ruthless. APB can be spectacular and awesome one moment, and frustrating as hell the next, amazing levels of customization in a game thats just like GTA, if you can get over the occasional hacker and the childish members of the community you are in for a treat, if not then dont play APB, go pet some kittens instead :p
5672	0	a	The graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥!!I Played it on ultra and it's â¥â¥â¥â¥!!Don't download the game!!It's a waste of time.The gameplay it's not so good,but it's not even that bad :)
3513	1	a	Wanna have ultimate character customization in a game in which no one gives a got damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it? Here ya go.  
322	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FAUHKOING AWESOME! TRY IT! LOVE IT!
6458	0	a	it has to meny hacker
8091	0	a	This game have a lot of cheaters now and is P2W. I'd rather to uninstall this for now untill they don't remove this options. But this is unbelievable. I had nice times with my friends and that's all. If you want to play just do it!
6879	0	a	Doesn't accept passwords, takes forever to load on SATA III SSD.
10186	1	a	Amazing game, I could play it forever. It's like a free Day Z, or kind of like a mix between Minecraft, Skyrim, and a modern/futuristic mmo. Just awesome. The best free game, or even overall, I have ever played
9416	0	a	This game completely sucks, I didnt like anything about it, and its missing sound....... Not recommend
9192	1	a	Hello, I am your average Fallen Earth player, with your average Fallen Earth player hours.
3227	1	a	Stands for Action Police Brain.
9117	1	a	This game is fun, especialy for those how like post apocalyptic survival kinda games. You basicly go around doing missions from npcs and craft weapons, armor, vichles, etc. Theres alot of wierd creatures in the world that you can kill and harvest after, moast of them are mutants or npc bandits.  Don't wory about getting killed and losing your stuff because moast of the map is pve, but you still have to whatch out for agressive npcs. The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go.  Over all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one. Because has we all know thats how games work.
7960	0	a	Love this game but can't play.. too much lag. not even in 4-5 years since game is running they didnt solve server lag 
7467	0	a	This game gave me cancer. It is simply awful. I do NOT recommend it.
4073	0	a	I tried it - and i really wanted to love it. But it sucks - hard :I Also: russian cheaters - russian cheaters everywhere
9085	1	a	They Basicly made this game for welfare bums that can't afford any FALLOUT GAMES.Fallout earth is a game about lag switching.And stealing from as many hardworking clans as you can...Gotta survive out in the wasteland.And pretend you're A girl so people give you free items and they can't kill you.
5034	0	a	i can play this game 
8874	0	a	I couldn't recommended this game to anyone. I've played it for years and now with the declining player base and lack of care from the company that owns it, the game has less than 200 players at peak times. This leads to an inbalanced system of older players having everything and newer players struggling to get what they need at lvl55.   There are no updates anymore. Events have become non existant and if you need GM help forget it. There is very little oversight from G1. The game is being left to decay. Lag has become a real issue and over the months it has not improved. If anything it has gotten worse.  When I first started playing FE it was great. Lots of players. events, GMs on daily. Any issues were sorted out in a timely manner. It was a very fun game to play. Now it is very different, which is a shame as there seems to be no other game like it.  If you are into PVP forget it. It is dead. Only PVE remains with the very occassional PVPer online.  In my opinion Fallen Earth isn't worth the download anymore.
9667	0	a	In tutorial the elevator is bugged graphic is a â¥â¥â¥â¥!!
3296	1	a	I Think Is A Bit Like GTA That Is Free To Play! But Remember That If Its Free To Play It Want Be That Good But I Still Have A Lot Fun Playing it Specialy With Someone :D Its Cool Get It If U Don't Belive ME!!!!

5931	0	a	good graphics not such a bad game  10/10 would recommend
77	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 
7775	0	a	APB is a great Free to Play game, the main problem is Free to play in this case, is free aslong as you don't mind being dominated constantly by Gold Ranked pay to win players, over half the content is inaccesible to players who wish to have a free game. This also means you and your group of 5 people can be dominated by about 2-3 pay to win players, with the best Kevlar addons and high rate of fire, aimbot like guns. This may sound like rage which a large amount of it is. However it is also the truth, if you wish to freeroam without missions with friends its a great game, but as soon as those Pay to win players arrive, just search for a new server, or leave the game. NOT WORTH THE STRESS!
7236	0	a	nothing but pay2win and hackers and trolls.
818	1	a	this is awesome
3069	1	a	it's awsome
8036	0	a	Its a free to play game, it's the same as all the others.
2631	1	a	FUN need fast internet to be able to play 
165	1	a	Since its been a while i played this game i decided to give it a look again when fairfight got released. I found the game more enjoyable since the amount of cheaters had been halved meaning less bs like that, sadly there was no real new things to the game except the R255 what i was done with quite quickly. So for a f2p its actually a good game where you can put plenty of time into and have fun in with friends but i would not recommend buying things like weapons on the armas marketplace since you are just wasting your money, altough premium is a good thing to buy.   I will give this game a 6,5/10 so Yes i would recommend it
2853	1	a	Pretty good game.
5467	0	a	Couldnt â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Launch the game cause of error      11/10 Ign
7174	0	a	game sucks. it doesnt even load up for me and for some reason everytime I wanna play the game it has to install everything again which takes about 2 minutes. Just play Killing Floor 2 instead people this game is horrible
9175	1	a	Sometimes I feel really sad and I just do not know what to do. I typically just go home and strip down to my socks and cradle back in forth in the fetal position. Playing this game has stopped me from doing this, and I am berry grateful. Thanks Shrek.
1928	1	a	i watch some videos about this and i thought it was really good but i will have to play it first
4005	0	a	The game in it's current state, I definitely cannot recommend. It has some pretty awesome customization, but thats honestly about all that keeps me coming back. The matchmaking is terrible, and there has only been cash shop item releases (no new real content) since G1 took over. They say proper new content will be possible once they finish the engine upgrade, but they've been promiseing the upgrade for 3+ years and it still seems it'll never be here. They also plan to overhaul the matchmaking system, which will definitely help keep new players around, as the system they have in place now is often exploited by veterans, and will end up matching them against newbies. With the fairly steep and long learning curve the game has, few will stick around to get the hang of it after getting steamrolled constantly.  tl;dr I would recommend this game once the matchmaking has been overhauled, and the engine upgraded, but in it's current state, it's skippable.
8858	1	a	For those of you looking for a fallout-ish experience, you wonât find it here For the very few people who actually read this review, Iâm going to start off with everything bad that it does. 1) The community feels as dead as all the enemies I had to kill to complete one objective 2) The game does nothing new, it is very generic and copy-paste of other games in the genre.  The purpose of a game like this is to do what similar games of its genre did and build on those ideas and make them better. Not fabricate what already exists and slap a âdoneâ sticker on the front. I want something new, with a quirk or unique feature, not a copy paste.  3) There is very little explanation about how skills, items and game mechanics work, only basic key mapping like moving, turning and combat. 4) The story is fairly mild at best 5) Melee combat is dull and unsatisfying 6) Quests have a tendency to âbug outâ or have confusing objectives, one situation was where I needed to go to a point on the map, let an NPC follow me and walk back to the start point. Apart from I failed the quest somehow on the first try, the game never explained how or why.  When I went back there the NPC that was meant to follow me no longer appears, and as such I have no idea how to complete the quest. Other situations like questing disappearing from my menu also happen frequently, meaning quests I was halfway through needed to be picked up again from a guy quite literally 3 miles away and completed in one go.  7) Menus are very clunky, from the start I was bombarded by a bunch of skills I didnât know (and still donât know) the effects or uses of. 8) The crafting system does nothing new, by which I mean it's all dull bashing objects togeather to make something out of thin air. It's also crafted in real time, which can sometimes be up to half an hour for some items. Maybe more. 9) How skills work is never explained, you have to figure it out via tooltips. 10) For me this game took over 50 minutes to download, unpack and patch before I could play. This was on a 100 mbp/s connection with no bottlenecks and commonly downloads big budget triple A games in under 30 mins. 11) I have no idea how they got the screenshots on the store page, I push everything to max and it still looks like something a commodore 64 would play. 12) Fallen Earth tries way to hard to be funny. Often forcing vulgar 12 year old humour at every turn.   So what is good about it?
6558	0	a	After playing 100 hours on it... I guess the game is okay, but the game really needs to be â¥â¥â¥â¥ing optimized, the more I play this game the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier my computer gets, it's like just playing this game pulls down my computer... I'll list some Pro's and Con's  Pros: -Unique character and car customizations -Nice custom creations(Music, cars, special logos etc...) -The gameplay is pretty basic and fun  Cons: -You'll get facerolled in 9/10 matches -Extremely harsh on newbies -Poor development... the glitches and bugs... I can't even... -Pay2win guns, if you want a better chance at winning matches... pay up. -PVP matchmaking is fked up, you'll be put against higher leveled players. -Horrible servers...  Honestly... if you can endure all those cons, then this game is really awesome, otherwise... yeah, that's it e.e if you can endure it, please tell me your secret... I know I listed more Cons then Pros but I can't really think of anything other good of the game other then the customizations.
4991	0	a	So I was eating this Chipotle burrito, and some of the meat fell out the back.  I really wanted to eat the meat with the tortilla, but I didnât want to get my hands all messy and I didnât have any utensils next to me, but I did have one certain disc next to me.  Thatâs about how much value this game is worth, the price of a plastic spoon.
1577	1	a	Allowed me to review the game before I downloaded it , so I say: -11.35853595837594/-10 because glitchin review. Trololololololololol
5690	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't play it. The matchmaking is broken the graphics have much to be desired. The weapons are unbalanced and the Bronze Silver Gold status is useless. The level up is unclear and pointless since you don't matter only the standing you have with contacts does. The servers are laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and there is absolutely no server moderation leaving hackers open chance to ruin your missions. And other players can ghost your team for the enemy side telling them where you are. Also, random players in the world can smash and destroy objectives and your vehicles and can possibly kill you setting your whole team back. The game is not pay to win nor skill based but just depends on what hacks you bought from  {LINK REMOVED}  systemcheats.net . Don't bother waste your time on it.
328	1	a	No engine updates and cheaters, game is quite great tho, shame see such potential go to waste. But still recommend it.
1284	1	a	This game is fun instead of getting GTA 5 just get this game and buy a membership this game is way better than GTA 5 this actually is optimized for PC and they care about there players!
10187	0	a	Game was extremely messy and buggy.
4865	0	a	They were kicking me from the server's for no reason
2347	1	a	Ã¿
275	1	a	Really Great Game because it has all things you need to do for example, Missions,Groups, etc
1139	1	a	I think that APB Reloaded is a good game and i think you should get it and make an account.
1847	1	a	love this game just wnat a pvp server so you can free roam and kill at same time
10365	1	a	I plan on playing Fallen Earth for a while to see how it goes, and as such, this review will see updates from time to time when I see big changes.  *REVIEW* As a player starting off in Fallen Earth, you're greeted by your Character Creation Screen. Everyone seems to have the same kind of build, with height being the main difference. Good choices for customisation and whatnot, but nothing ground breaking.  The Tutorial is straightforward and simple. There is no 'Hand-Holding' as such in it, just the basics of gameplay and combat. Here, you are introduced into what seems to be an OK story.  Why is the story OK? Well, it's corny ('You are special' is what you're told, but yet your just an ordinary guy by the looks of it) and a bit narrative. You don't need a Ph.D to figure out the story from what every NPC tells you, who seem to be devoid of opinions and just state facts.  Controls-wise, it seems ok. WASD, 1-0, Shift+1-0 etc. Pretty standerd stuff, but that's not a bad thing. The controls are quite nice to play with, and I haven't decided to re-bind any keys which is a boon.   Combat is simple enough from what I have seen, but has possabilities in the perks and skills you unlock. IMO, Ranged Weaponry seem to have the dominancy in this game. The rifle you find in the Tutorial is a staple weapon and really easy to use.   The voice actors seem to be good in this game, and they add an air of professionalism to the game.   *Verdict* All in all, a solid game that looks good from the get-go. The â¬0/$0/Â£0 price tag is nice, so I would recommend everyone try this game for at least 30 minutes, just to see how things pan out.
10342	0	a	In comparison to the other MMO's I've had the opportunity to play this one is not as engaging or appealing.  It lacks the visual draw, the voice over acting, the sound effects, the action, etc. after Â½ an hour I decided it wasnât worth the time to develop the toon.   Unlike SWTOR/ SWG/GW/GW2/DDO/NWN/WOT/RIFT this game does not have a draw factor for me and I was looking forward to it after reading the review stating that if you like melancholy open world no pressure to get mission done games this is for you.  Wishing them luck with a re-boot if it comes to that.  
8716	0	a	This is a great game, fun to play, and enjoyable as you progress through the ranks as either an Enforcer/Criminal.  Unfortunately I will not play this game again, due to the community. Not even 5 minutes will pass without there being some outburst of someone accusing someone else of hacking, or being a noob. Even though there is a solution to this, it will never change on APB's community.  Hackers - Can be resolved through tightening security protocols etc. I mean when someone openly admits they cheat and have spent huge amounts of game-time proving it, as well as accumulating a large amount of reports, they still not banned? This game is not administered. Not at all. And if someone just has to google 'Aimbot for APB' etc just to get a download link and start ruining the game... Then there must obviously be a lack in administration.  As for those who repeatedly call someone noob. Kill team-mates repeatedly. Go AFK or just idle-by. Well done, you have just turned this game against itself. Those high ranked players who wish to be kicked from the team so as to not lose with some new players, achieved by harrassing and killing team-mates. Do they realize that they making the game un-enjoyable for new players. Let me put this simply... NO NEW PLAYERS = EVENTUAL SERVER CLOSURE.  I swear the community is childish. Someone once argued with me because he called me a noob, yet I agreed saying I was new to the game and added that he shouldn't be too hard on new players. Be a little mature, I said. The next 30 minutes of me trying to find out his reason for team killing resulted in him finding out he is 5 years younger than me. After that it was a pure ignore.  So basically, admins must admin the game. Players must not deter new players.
1276	1	a	Very fun game but my only problem is all the micro transactions and lack of players on some servers.
751	1	a	Not exactly Grand Theft Auto, but if it was, I wouldn't need to play to find out where it goes. The freedom to roam the streets as either Criminal or Enforcer is enticing, like playing Cops and Robbers except I actually get to riddle them full of holes.  Criminals can keep busy doing all kinds of things, breaking into store fronts and stealing merchandise, mugging people on the street, stealing vehicles and turning them into chop shops for a finders fee, making that money.   Enforcers on the other hand kind of get the short end of the stick. With few opportunities to make money outside of missions, progression obtaining better gear is a good bit longer, but without Enforcers, Criminals would have no one to fight. I think that Enforcers could use a bit more of a pick-me-up.  Guns. Honestly, outside of vehicular manslaughter, this is your only kill option, and frankly, I get bored with just guns. I would love to sneak up behind those Crims and put a blade between their ribs. So many opportunities would have been mine if there were a melee option.  Third person point of view kind of hurts the excitement a little bit, it's difficult to really pinpoint the reason behind it but I always feel a good bit more control in first person perspective.  Driving is a challenge, but I actually like it that way, learning all of the nuances to different vehicles, knowing when to start turning, take your foot off the gas, and put it back on to make that absurd u-turn, all the while laughing because everyone else is smacking into the walls, trying to catch up. Learning curves are sick...  Movement and running are okay, no real complaints, but interacting with the world? Doors, ladders, fences etc. is very primitive. You can Only climb from the bottom of the ladder to the top or vice versa, instead of being able to sit on the ladder from the perfect vantage point and open fire, or waiting for the perfect moment to climb that last rung. The only barriers you can climb over are predesignated chainlink and wooden fences so entries and escapes can only get so creative. Doors, you can only kick, you can't open slowly and maintain anonimity. The worst thing about it all I think, is that your name is brightly displayed over your character, even if only a hair on the top of your head is visible. No sneaking up in this game.  Story? There's supposed to be one, but personally I think it along with the missions and gameplay lack any real depth and character growth. It's basically glorified Team Deathmatch.  Temporary guns. To get anything permanent, takes tons of grinding. I'm not even going to get into this.  Customization? I think that Second Life could have done a lot better if they followed this games rules on customization, giving you basic shapes to work into your own design. This allows for great degrees of creativity, matched with a lack of graphic-produced lag, making for a comparitively fluid, yet personal experience. Just be sure to go into the customization with patience and a solid plan, and it'll come out great.  Pros  Customization Driving challenge Freedom to roam  Cons  Primitive movement Glowing names No melee Lack of depth   I think I'll keep playing on and off because it is a fun game, but I am actively looking for a replacement on my list, so let me call this a tentative recommendation.
677	1	a	Take it from someone that has way more hours on this game then steam shows (as i played before the Steam release) This is a great game, yes it has its flaws and its dev team can be very untrustworthy for what they say. But all in all this game is awesome. The biggest cry you will see out there is 'P2W' and 'Hackers'. This game is far from P2W, one of the most powerful weapons in the game is the Starter gun known as the STAR-556 with its big brother the N-Tec, both f2p weapons that can beat ANY gun at ANY range with the proper amount of skill. In fact around 90% of the games Premium Weapons are Re-skinned versions of the f2p varient with a different look and sound (N-Tec=CR-5[AK-&gt;M16]) granted there are a few weapons that are unique in the premium (ARMAS) store but they are far from P2W, requireing a situational or unique playstle to use/master, the problem comes down to price with permanant premium guns costing $20-$60 each. The next cry comes from hackusations. Where as i found hackers are really far and few in between depending on your server (EU servers and Asian Servers have time and time again proven to have more hackers 10 fold) and when you do encounter a hacker they can be outplayed just like any other player. Wallhacks wont help you here, aimbots only aim they dont account for recoil or dispersion.  This game is great even at its current state, where most of its negitive reviews come from F2P warriors that cant even afford a summer sale game or a runescape membership and people that just cant cope with its learning curve (which is very steep). But once you learn the game and are able to stick with it, you will LOVE it. with endless customization and tons of laughs to be had ive found myself playing this game over Triple A games.  Give it a shot and dont give up too soon.  10/10 would spank walletless 12 year olds again.
1681	1	a	I put a yes as it isn't too bad a game anymore (used to be very buggy and had insane car lag; since for some reason they're server side). While there are still pay to win elements it doesnt seem as prevelant. If you have a decent computer and some friends it can be plenty of fun.
2828	1	a	Great character creation and artwork. Strangely addicting gameplay.
3415	1	a	This game is oodles of fun. But don't let that mask the greediness of the people of Gamers First. Yes this game does intail all that it says. But you have to 'pay' for more then half of them. Customization, Permement and Exclusive Guns, Cash and Progression (Exp) bonuses, Car Parts, Symbol creation, and I'm sure there is lots more you will find.   Premium (Which entails Bonus Cash and EXP, Symbol/Car Customisation and... I think that's it.) costs 799 G1 credits which ammounts to 10$ US total. But that I beleive is the beta price. Because the image has a 1199 (15$ US) crossed out in the back which makes the current price a special and assuming it doesn't last until it's fully released.  Permament/Premium guns. Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake. These guns are character bound. So if you want a gun on your Criminal and Enforcer then your lookin at 120
1629	1	a	Nice third person shooter game, i recommen this to everybody!
5095	0	a	The game would be fun if i didnt get destroyed everytime i joined a match/mission because everyone is decked out in strong gear and demolishes me as someone with almost no gear because i just started the game.
7820	0	a	You ever wonder what it's like when you mix elements such as Massive Multiplayer online capabilities and Great free-roaming environments together? Heh, me too... You might want to check any game other than this one. So, go on, get out of here before your elders see you desacrating your family honor...
5302	0	a	Its a swirling peak of awesome, heavily coated in a foul shell of excrement. I just got through playing wildstar, this game was a brutal reminder of the personal customizaition. You can have everything you want, with a huge investment of time; if you want to speed it up with money, you may. PVP takes up the other half of the game, I really think its never going to be what it should because people refuse to communicate, especially in such an open-world environment; however when they do, the pvp can be amazing. Matchmaking needs a lot of work. i'd give this game a 10, but it's still really rough around the edges, and tbh it probably just needs more funding, give it a C for good effort
7153	0	a	Game wouldnt even start up for me.  
1347	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
8622	0	a	IT IS CRAP 
2491	1	a	It is like GTA but online. I don't pay for money or do missions I just drive around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not bad for relieving stress.
10788	1	a	  I havent played alot but so far so good. Maps are big, guns are good i could really go on with this for a ong time. Just one con: When you take your eyes from the screen it hurts as f**k :D
2864	1	a	This game is like a Free GTA, plus more
3328	1	a	Rated A for AWESOME
7785	0	a	It took me almost an hour to get this game to even work. When I finnally did get it working the 'next' boton was behind my start bar and unclickable. the window unsizable. Im sure it would be a great game if it was possable to actully get past the 'choose your faction' screen. at the very least make the window sizable or make the game full screen.
7782	0	a	Ya know...  I've played this game for a while and I've been going through the motions of the missions. I liked the concept but the lagging, other rude players, and hacking (Which I was surprised that it wasn't addressed by the Devs) then suddenly had it when I got tired of getting knocked on how bad I played. I came knowing that it was 'Pay to win' and wondered if that difference would lead to a better game now I know.
8738	0	a	Cheaters everywhere.
1287	1	a	Its not such a bad game but if you feel like getting paired up with the highest ranks of them all Then play this
7591	0	a	BROKEN Hackers wont get banned. ppl casually hacking. only hax everyweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeererererererer â¥â¥â¥â¥ nowdays dews only sucks money out of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit â¥â¥â¥â¥ KAUHEETA â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ only pay to win dews dont deliver promised stuff
10502	1	a	Played over 1k h of this game just not on steam.  I met so many interesting people,basicaly knew how every guy plays.  BEWARE While playing this game you may get an adrenaline rush.  This was a fast paced,team oriented capture the flag game. It looked and sounded amazing for a f2p.  Yeah the game was a bit unbalaced but when you get better it really doesn't matter.  If the team doesn't cooperate you lost no matter how good the players are individually . It had 9 classes so you get the point,as long as at least 5-8/16 players play their roles team can work.  I won't even talk about the last ''patch''.  Some people say this copied Halo but Tribes series is older than Halo. Some people say that this game is full of hackers, in over 1k h i met maybe 5 hackers(if even that many). Some people complained that the game is too unbalanced when in reality its just a lil bit harder to get into it than some more casual shooters.  Oh yea btw the game is DEAD. Sadly the devs moved onto smite and abandoned one of the best (if not the best) f2p fps of alltime.  Will forever remember this game and the people i played with even tho i'll probably never hear from them again...VGB my friends.
6589	0	a	Too much to set up before playing, too much time for account creation and a million hours for the loading screens. Oh.. and let's not forget lag
3350	1	a	Fun Fun..... not a lot for me to do like drive around since my Fps skills suck but its a fun game.
8326	0	a	God, where to start....  First off, the idea of this game is beautiful, cops vs criminals in a sprawling city based area? Absolutely amazing. However, when I played this game, back maybe about a year ago, you'd see plenty of new players, you know bronze peeps. But now, it's like, everyone is paying to win very hard, and are either golds or silvers, and you very rearely see bronze peope anymore. If you wash away the p2w paint plastered over this game, and just think about it's concept, you can see that the game is well thought out, and even properly executed, but poorly maintained. I don't mean in the sense of bugs or glitches, but losing just about every single mission with matchmaking like, 2 silvers vs 2 golds. It's unbearable, but I keep coming back for the concept of this game, there is nothing quite like this game, I love rollin through town on my customized Dolton, with absolutely no upgrades, and I still enjoy the game from time to time. Honestly, the game is fine, but the devs can't stick this pay to win stuff on just about every single thing in this game.  No new player should have access to equipment vet players have. This game is fun, if you like CopsVsRobbers, then try it out. And appreciate the games concept, and not the playability.
3304	1	a	Go ahead punk, make my d- OH GOD HE'S PAYING TO WIN, HELP!
5487	0	a	Matchmaking is very frustrating. (Two Silvers v. Two golds) Weapons feel unbalanced, and paying members are definitely the winners in this (Pay-to-win) Freemium game.
603	1	a	1.Install 2.Make account 3.Start playing 4.Choose to be a cop 5.Get killed by a P2P criminal 6.Uninstall  10/10 Would arrest again
3654	1	a	very nice game +1000 hours (before steam) very stable and their servers are the greatest! Its not laggy at all..  The matchmaking is so fair and works just fine this game is so fair and good! 10/10 Rage Quit every goddam time!
1628	1	a	ON my last pc i could not play (windows 8) but so far from videos (not gameplay) it looks good!
6843	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
7475	0	a	awkward car controls, heavy system requirements, high ping.... seriously, stay away from this game unless you want to waste time ==
6906	0	a	Game won't load. But I wouldn't say its bad. Just putting thumbs down because it won't start up.
10127	1	a	alot of fun in both freemium and premium modes. Freebies are limited in crafting ques and exp. Freemiums get crafting skill que unlocked and around 100% exp, There are 3 premiums and the cheapest is survovor for $10 and is well worth it IMHO ;)  One of the few games in a post apocaplypse setting that have detailed char creation right down to tattoos and makeup, good and fun gameplay for both free and premium players. Also level cap is 55 regardless of your free or paid you are not limited like most mmo's to a lower level cap.   Crafting is fun and you can craft yourself a awesome set of gear that is better then anything you can buy unlike WOW or other mmo's where usually you will find better in quests then your crafting allows you to make...
10510	1	a	It's like a game of connect the dots - except the dots are usually moving at 300km/h.
3375	1	a	  Its good
382	1	a	very fun game, if you want somethingn like GTA this is the game for you.
6265	0	a	I CANT GET THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME TO START
3470	1	a	Trash.
5362	0	a	waaaaaaayyy to unbalenced if you're even a fairly new player you have no hope of living once an enforcer or a long time player sets their sights on you due to unbalenced everything and enforcers are just waaay to over powered i mean seriously? they can just handcuff you then you can't do ANYTHING????? this is the reason i have a different computer now cause i smashed my laptop after getting arrested for the 7th or 8th time for no legit reason :/.... 0.01 outta ten
3971	0	a	It's not a bad game, but it's anything but good. The driving is annoying, the gunplay is nothing spectacular, and the AI is crappy (this is the best word I can think to describe it as).  All this is a pay-to-win mediocre cop vs robber game that's not really all that fun and could really use some major fixes and fine-tuning to mechanics.  However, because it is free, give it a try and see for yourself - some people actually enjoy these kind of shooters, so you might as well. 5/10
6697	0	a	Pay to win. rofl
2007	1	a	Ya this is a kool experience in itself.
5100	0	a	I can't do much of a review game never truly launched. I use windows 7 professional 64x. Pro free Con wasted about 90 minutes trying to get to play it.
6179	0	a	if u r not from usa then this game is a Sh it for ur country... awful lag... u wanna shoot someone? GUESS WHAT? U r already dead! my internet speed its not bad... i have played plenty of other games... where the lag wasnt an issue...
10794	1	a	ive had a weird relationship with this game. over the years ive played it on and off all the time, and let me say this i liked it always, however i never really got good at playing it. so i never really was able to compete with the really good players on a skill based level, however what that ment for me was just that instead of outplaying them i had to outsmart them which was defenitly not impossible, so in the end do i recommend this game? even with all the long time players that will borderline murder you in the 10+ servers? yes. but only under one condition: You have to have a friend that plays this game and who is good at it, so you can play together. trust me this will make your expierience soooooo much better even when playing against long time players.
2711	1	a	I accidently left this running for like 2 days, but I played a good hour and made Paul Sr. from American Chopper. 10/10 IGN 
8866	0	a	Downloaded enormous game file. This took an entire day.  Created account.  Read EULA. Standard stuff.  Read SECOND EULA. Code of conduct and a few weird roleplay related rules. Mental note to stay away from those servers.  Downloaded five hundred updates. Another day is now nearly over.  Loading screen / ad.  Create character.  Loading screen / ad.  Finally get to make my first gameplay related keystrokes.  Game freezes after 4 seconds of play.  Wait.  Game resumes.  Punch small man.  Small man yells at me.  Game freezes.  Wait.  Game crashes.  Uninstall.  Moral: you get what you pay for.
4859	0	a	it's really pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
6927	0	a	Its a pay to win game!!  Was fun at first before they got greedy and now only cheaters and people with credit cards play. AVOID THIS GAME!!
9300	0	a	Well, i played this game about 1 year ago + and it was nice game i enjoyed it it was original something new for me like a apocalyptic games fan and MMORPG i was excited but now.... its trash all i can say.
1749	1	a	I honestly don't understand what people are complaining about- granted so far I've only clocked in 4 hours of gameplay in the two days that I've had it. Yeah, it's a bit glitchy, has a few hackers, and omg the car controls are so wonky I can hardly drive... but for what it is- it's a good game. You go around shooting people, making money, and unlocking content as you go to customize your character even more. Yeah, some things you have to pay for obviously the money is going into keeping the game up and running. And yes, it can get kind of boring after about 2-3 hours of consecutive gameplay without any friends.. but if you switch servers here and there (which can be tricky when the glitches decide to act up at this moment) and focus on getting your loot (so your character isn't boring as heck to look at).. you fill the time. If you actually talk to people you will see a lot of them are pretty decent and nice- not trolling asshats. With the reviews I've read around various sites, I was expecting everyone to be on my case because I'm new. I was expecting total disregard for teams. I was expecting huge trolls and hackers sitting around waiting for a guy like me to come around. Not the case. Besides, what are you expecting from a game that you play online, objective to kill, and it's free? I totally recommend the game to anyone looking to have some fun. It's pretty casual for the most part. You can even just stand around and talk if you feel like it. Rating: 7.5(almost an 8)/10.
1838	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
981	1	a	TLDR: There's only one or two real 'issues' with this game, and other than that it's pretty fun.  Before you play, just know that you will think this is GTA, you will pretend it's GTA, and once you actually get through about 20 levels worth of missions, you will realize how mistaken you were.  All points Bulletin: Reloaded (though I've never heard of the first APB unless my serial killer of an uncle is involved, shout out to you greg!) Is an 'action' shooter, semi RPG, MMO, racing, blah blah. It has little bits of everything except sci fi in it unless you consider the main item mall area where the weirdest â¥â¥â¥â¥s I've ever seen in my life casually parade themselves through the courtyard in a display of... just... I've never such creativity in a clothing editor since the sims 3, But anywho.  The game isn't bad, the community is decent though it'd literally kill them to add in a real 'Guild' system instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ attempt of a gang or police possie they've tried to immulate. But I digress! Here's the main gyst of the game for you all who are bothering to read past the terrible jokes.  The game takes place in New York, scratch that, Los Angeles, it could also be Chicago. So the game takes place in [insert crime filled city with people who give no â¥â¥â¥â¥s here] where you, either a startup policeman, or a just beginning gangster are fighting for the city. The game is not a sandbox like I was hoping, I was expecting to get my first gun, walk outside, and immediately be blown to swiss cheese by anybody from any side, fortunately they have a smart side of the system that takes out SOME of the fun, but not all of it.   You pick your side, you get your first mission and off you go to learn the ropes. Of course being the upstanding citizen I am, I had to pick being a gangster am I right? Because 'If the police won't clean up the streets, we will!' and all that jazz. After the tutorial missons finish you have a small wad of cash, and the game throws you to the wolves after that allowing you as a gangster to either steal and sell cars, rob jewelry or electronics stores by ramming your car into the window conveniently, or by doing missions. Or you can be a cop and pray that you're in the vicinity of someone breaking the law, obviously you can see the perks of each side. That is a joke, there's only one side you should be playing at this point, and it involves the scantilly clad punk asses of the gangster side, why else would you be playing the game if there's no 'breasts' in them (thank you Steam for free speech and blocking out words for female chest pieces)  As you continue through the game you buy new weapons as your loadout for missions. Here's where the cross rival faction actually has some sort of real role in the game now. While on a mission, if it lasts longer than 1-2 minutes and you're struggling to pass a certain point, cops can be sent to terminate you on your mission. No no, not permanently, however the game's been out so long and missions repeat so often that you'll either be paired against A. A player who has no idea he's even after you. B. A player who obviously doesn't care and is just waiting for someone else to break the law to steal stolen money (just play a criminal you â¥â¥â¥â¥.) or C. A cop who has done nothing but bust people since day 1, knows every glitched spot to stop you from being able to complete you mission at all, and is able to 720 no scope you with a rocket from 300m out with a flick of his wrist, all while stroking his... ego. You get the gyst.   Like any other game, this game involves some sort of skill with shooters, or you just have to get that handy rapid fire shotgun and some body armor and not give any further â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the game. It's simple though, criminals get money, cops get money somewhat, both side saves up for better weapons and cars and armor until they can 720 no scope with rockets all day and not care.   In the end, the game has maybe a 6/10, I've like a lot of hours into this game but most of it was spent customizing my gangs clothing.  All in all, the character editor is 10/10, absolutely gorgeous, nothing bad to say about that, even at lowest detail. The mechanics for the game such as DRIVING I'll give it a 4/dipstick because whoever though it was a good idea to have your driving controls on the serverside instead of the clientside needs to be beaten with 2 bricks, 1 that is perfect in every way labelled 'Serverside' and one that's got some rough edges named 'Clientside'. Just uncontrollably flail the Servisde brick around his face for a bit until it eventually makes contact, and for Clientside, just give him a good whack as soon as he reads the name. Maybe he'll think twice about pressing W to go forward and waiting a full second before controls decide they'd like to move the car.  Cars still look sexy though. 6/10, would drive car like a snake again for some laughs and stop and stare at female avatars that make even straight women drool.
10785	1	a	you earn very little for every match and if you are like me and likes to grind and get max equipment with effort, i think you will not like the game because the matches take a lot of time and at the end give very little points to unlock weapons and equipment. Otherwise you just like to play games just for playing them you might like this game if you are a fan of unreal tournament.
10640	1	a	This game looks cool!
1804	1	a	11/10-ign 2 little freddys 2 mennu hekers -spooderman   You should play this game. One of the best F2PTPS(Free2PlayThirdPersonShooter)

2798	1	a	I play this game when I want the flood of hackers to punish me.
7546	0	a	Terribly wasted potential. I was in the Beta for this game many years ago, and I even pre-ordered it when it came out. However, after Real Time World went under, and it was picked up again by Reloaded, everything went down the toilet. As said countless times before, the customization is amazing, and I really wish it could see it's full potential. However as we've seen, that's never going to happen.
6455	0	a	Here's my recommendation: that you AVOID this game, and REFUSE to pay any money towards the publishers: G1. The customization is great (well, what was left to GamersFirst by the original creators: Realtime Worlds, RIP), and the driving is funny in a Gmod-physics kind of way, but the combat is utterly deploreable. Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin. Marx isn't turning in his grave, he's weeping and saying 'I told you so!'

10410	1	a	Coolest Post-Apocalyptic Game,Even If The Only, Game I Have Ever Played. 9.7/10
7926	0	a	Played it for a while, it was ok and then realized players on your team will hinder you so you dont win (assuming to help level up their friends on the other side). Wasnt even worth the download!
3016	1	a	doesnt work well not the best havent even been able to play it
1988	1	a	Probally one of the worse games to play. Its full of try hards and the starting mission....you just get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless you get a massive group. Wouldn't bother downloading.
2579	1	a	'This is the best game'
1951	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
3686	1	a	I'm just gonna write basic Pros and Cons of the game, but in general I'm definitely a fan.  Pros: - Awesome customization, sliders to customize face and body in anyway you want, also available customization for clothes and cars. - Fast paced - Cops vs robbers / good vs bad theme - Easy lvl up as a Criminal - Great to play with a group of friends  Cons: - Devs abandoned the game for quite some time (originally APB), now we have APB: Reloaded (which is now slightly abandoned also) - Community usually quite arrogant to newcomers, and despite it being a 18+ game quite imature people. Dont expect immediate help being a newbie in this game, or at any point. - The side that has less players online is harder to play for - Harder to lvl up as enforcer (which is a bit unfair) - Hackers... (usually enforcers, but ocassionaly criminals).  (Not all pros and cons are listed (obviously), those are just the ones that I notice the most (and that I care more about))  But, you should try it, if you don't mind the cons.
6639	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
7213	0	a	APB Reloaded is personally one of my favourite game. You can customise your character and your car! The guns are quite well-balanced.  However, there are many issue that is a hinderance to the game. Such examples will be unstable latency where if you stay in a country far from the server, you will not be able to move your character and shoot smoothly as people who stay in the country that has the server. Another problem is the premium guns where some free-players and beginners will find themselves in a serious disadvantage compared to premium players who has wide range of guns suited to their situations.  APB is one of those games where it feels good to play at first, but as times goes on, you will find yourself in a battle of keeping your interest alive of playing the game.  I give this a 5/10.   -Kiro
10800	1	a	Amazing..........just incredible. Destiny + Halo + Advanced Warfare = A masterpiece on PC
1904	1	a	Ok its like GTA but mass multi with many customisation and a load of fun and gunfire. still a bit unfair because the Punkbuster seem to dont have any effect on cheaters and hackers, but i hope theyll fix it some time. i give it a 7.6 out of 10 Ragdolls.
3539	1	a	IT'S NOT AN ADDICTION MAN! I CAN STOP ANY TIME DON'T â¥â¥â¥â¥IN JUDGE ME!I JUST DO IT IT IN MY SPARE TIME DON'T THINK I HAVE A PROBLEM YOU HAVE A PROBLEM â¥â¥â¥â¥FACE!

1467	1	a	Great game, bad hosting company.
198	1	a	just a 5 star action packed thirdperson shooter 
8069	0	a	This game is deader than the zombie apocalypse, the nuclear fallout, or whatever disaster that decreases human population density up to 50 square miles per person per server region.   If you played the game right now, you will get to be a part of a special few that have spent too much money to let the game go. Also some people just can't play the game without 'trainers'.  You want to play with the same person every night? That have been playing years before you? Has tricks that you don't have? I guess this game is for you.   As a person that has been a commune to the game before, my warning of this game being a 'Gold' drainer has not been heeded 5 years ago. Buy permanent to win or pay premium to be financially stable to even participate in the whole item customization and selling experience.  Yes you will have to rent guns that expire weekly if you have not bought any. Expire weekly.  If not bought. Up to 20k gold for a gun. When a maximum amount possible weekly earned is a little 5k. Not counting the the little Cops and Robbers sideshow that earns more money than the actual missions, nobody does that anymore.   The new guns that came out on the market is to say 'Sorry but we are too lazy to fix the weapon balance, here buy these new ones instead'. Those guns are not 'rentable'. 
3036	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
1137	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.

1640	1	a	it sucks, constantly drains me, and screaming, and im not talking about my girlfriend
9900	1	a	I greatly reccommend this game to people who enjoy story, and crafting aspects, but perhaps not for the people who just want to shoot things. If you're into the latter, then it will also be good for you if you want to partake in pvp or wander and kill things. All around it's a solid game without any of the overly-intrusive money making opportunities that most F2P games take. If you have the money, then you should definitely support the creation of new content for a very solid game.
5216	0	a	11/10 after 900 Hours punkbuster decides to kick me out everytime when i try to login.  but seriously, they updated their punkbuster so less hackers, P2W ofc. and the game needs to be fixed, if you have 4Gb RAM you cannot play this game it will be laggy. no more F2P items coming, only P2W items example pants what costs 20â¬ irl money. cannot recommend.
6571	0	a	Cant even figure out how to beat the tutorial  -10/10
9798	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
1563	1	a	much die so law enforcement  very MMO wow.
7524	0	a	absolutly broken game. the customization if phenomenal the game is great. but the match making in the game completely ruins the game 100%. as a new player you WILL get paired up against people who are damn near max rank and have been playing for years. and the devs are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ heads who wont fix there game. if you havent been playing for a year youre going to lose. the game is also WAY to heavily reliant on getting mods for your character and weapons none of which come easy. untill they fix the match making i will always say no to this game.
5980	0	a	i can't play it it just loading at the desktop
175	1	a	very fun, its basically a f2p gta
501	1	a	APB Reloaded is a really great game, Soo many games out there yet all feel like we're all clones doing the samething over and over again. APB, doesn't have that feeling everyones different you'll never find someone that has the same look or style as you do. Imagine your favorite character from anything... well with APB being so free, you can make that said character in game. Don't let the reviews saying 'Oh its a Pay 2 Win game' change your mind about APB just about every game has in game purchases that's whats starting to happen everywhere(Lower dem Arma Prices Dow dat shiz cray).. It's the little things that make life even better with friends this game.. is one of those little things in a gamers life you won't RAGRET...Don't forget everyone gets a little upset when they die and may insult you after just make sure to WHISPER so you won't wake up the neighbors.. So download this game get in San Paro and kill some (Insert curse word here).. xP
6299	0	a	dont play this game
4361	0	a	game did NOT work I hate this
3365	1	a	Really well thought out game - a bit pricey if you're looking for items on the marketplace; but understandable due to how the game itself is free and doesn't require you to buy anything for it in order to play without any hassle - ignoring the people who complain about it being a Pay2Win scenario. Buying marketplace items is just for vanity mostly. :)
9472	0	a	Honestly I Probably might like this game if it wasn't for  A)The 3rd Party EULA/Login  and B) the fact i couldn't login even though i had signed up  Hopefully this will be fixed.
9200	1	a	Quite frankly, this game makes me want to sever an artery in my wrist, smear my body in â¥â¥â¥â¥ and feed myself to pigs. So deperessing and boring.
1815	1	a	Propanity. 10/10
4476	0	a	One word to describe my experience in this game : Hackers   Another player openly admitted he was running hacks during gameplay and then proceeded to highlight every other player in the server running them for me. I didn't believe them at first but then after seeing what they could do there was no doubt these players are running hacks.  I thought when I saw the huge green banner saying 'Fair Fight' that is what I would get... WRONG!!  It is a Pay 2 Win game loaded with Hackers and Whales. The lag is so bad that I thought my keyboard was messing up but nope-- turns out all driving input is tied in with your latency so if you get a bad ping spike (which hackers exploit to no end) your vehicle becomes 100% uncontrollable.  Avoid this game at all costs. I would say to buy GTA V instead but they have the same issues and others with a worthless customer support team who avoid responding to tickets via any loophole they can think of even when not based on factual information.  Great game concept APB has .. terrible delivery.
9090	0	a	Edit: I've got a decent computer so more thoughts on the game are at the very bottom  Similar to APB Reloaded, only that it crashes instead of giving me huge framerate issues, it has many graphical glitches which lead to framerate issues.  I found myself trying really hard to enjoy this game because it's basically a multiplayer version of Fallout, Match made in heaven, right? But it simply just doesn't work at all. All the times I tried to play it, it crashed my computer, even while I was playing on the lowest settings! and to top it all off: these weren't even regular crashes, these were BLUE SCREENS! on WINDOWS 7! I didn't even know these existed on modern systems!   Don't play this game, it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ compatibility.  So, I played the game for a while, it looks sloppy and ugly even on the highest settings, the animations and models look so old and dated. Also the aiming is weird in this game, I'm used to my aim not completely following my crosshair, and instead hitting where the animation plays, which is not how melee works in this game.  So, if you were to attack something with a melee weapon, it may look like you hit it but you haven't, and same thing in reverse. Speaking of combat, you cannot hit NPCs which are too far away (even though it looks like you do, blood and dust does show, but their health bars do not deplete) I can understand this was done to prevent people doing this to players, but come on. NPCs. Seriously.  It's also very boring, but I'll have to give credit for making the game semi-straight forward. Still not worth downloading.
6852	0	a	This game is just bad. First time I tried it, filled with adds promoting there FaceBook page so on. This game is full of rubbish like this. I wouldn't recommend, even if it is a F2P
5610	0	a	*** UPDATED ***  A game that shut down two weeks after its initial release because of Realtime Worlds closing their doors. GamersFirst took control of the game, and in short it is now a tower of duct tape.  The premise at first seems cool, gangs and vigilantes fighting in a modern urban environment, with 100 players in one map causnig chaos. The issue is Realtime Worlds nor GamersFirst even bothered to adapt their own servers or the netcode to handle that many people. While you won't experience unplayable lag, there will occassionally be spikes.  APB Reloaded's community is nothing but pure toxicity, consisting of adults and teenagers alike with the mentality of a child. Yelling/swearing in chat or voice is not uncommon, and their fuses are like that of a munitions warehouse. The worst part is this community thinks the game qualifies as an e-sport, if you can read that through all the vulgarity.  Old recylced humor, internet celebrity wanna be's, and sex jokes are all too common and this is one of the reasons I left. It annoyed me to no end.  Probably the most sinister of activities is the company running it. They made it Pay to Win locking all the cool stuff to paying, and is hellbent on taking advantage of the toxic community in order to squeeze every single penny out of them.  The only reason you should play this is for griefing purposes. Play as an offensive character and â¥â¥â¥â¥ someone off, that's all I ever did, and I will never forget the golden reactions.
6694	0	a	So the game is getting some serious age right now. Decided to take the game for a spin today, to check if network issues has been fixed. Again!  Took my car for a drive, going to check if I could get to the closest gas station without crashing.  Another player appeared in front of me, driving. None of us didn't even bother to touch the steering wheel, but went flat out crossing our fingers in a head to head collision. This is how bad the lag is.  Unplayable.
9877	1	a	A decent post-apocalyptic MMO with a deep crafting system and a lot of content. Not really pay-to-win either. Definitely worth a try if the genre appeals to you or you want an MMO with something a little different to offer.
7076	0	a	Pay to play! That's all I can say.....
2690	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
8310	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ED
1807	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
5584	0	a	this game ruined my sound.
5463	0	a	Unbalanced pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Until they actually decide to use the rank system to make the game FAIR, don't bother playing it.
10178	1	a	Probably one of the best F2P games out there , well worth it
5746	0	a	This game is just a Carbon-Copy of Crackdown for Xbox 360. Don't waste your time because it is mostly pay to win and you could use your hard-drive space for another bad f2p game.
4423	0	a	GTA ONLINE GTA ONLINE GTA ONLINE HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT GO â¥â¥â¥â¥IN PLAY GTA ONLINE
1671	1	a	APB is a large scale free-roam third person free to play shooter. Especially fun with friends. The Game takes place in San Paro, a city ravaged with crime. there are two sides enforcer and criminals. The customazation is deep on all levels. You are able to go on missions and battle against the enemy organization for a objective.
2639	1	a	really cool game  
1204	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
1077	1	a	Nice game...

478	1	a	A very good game, really fun if playied with your friends.  It's a bit complicated to understand when you're a newbie, just look for a veteran that will explain you ;)

6052	0	a	This game isnt bad but there are alot of hackers and not very fun when the game is free to play but its pay to win
6801	0	a	This is an OK game, not really worth my money (or my time), but to each his own.
10396	0	a	Horrible game. The interface is clumsy and unintuative, even with customization. The graphics are sub-par, and hardly anything in the game can be interacted with, even though there are what appear to be useful items strewn about. Don't waste your time with this one.
10423	1	a	Good apocalyptic feel hunter gatherer exploring crafting and stuff, good times. combat is easy and good. haha. Simple stories but nice. Relaxing rides on my hourse I call Tumble Weed. No presure to buy anything and no need for it. Only buy something like some extra goodies like an outfit etc... if you want to support the game. And it runs nice no problems here.
9777	0	a	Fastest uninstall ever! Looks like crap, plays like crap and froze both times i fired it up. Garbage.

10491	1	a	A great free to play MMO with an addictive chained quest progression through the first major areas (I've just reached the 'conflict towns' where factions can be chosen). Just riding a horse, or driving a buggy, through the post-apocalyptic wilderness is a strangely relaxing experience! At least until eaten by a sandworm!
3985	0	a	This game is utter garbage. Stay away.  The audio is annoying Graphics look like they belong on a PS2 era console Its pay to win The gameplay is rage inducing

3801	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. Horrible community rife with cheaters, bare bones, barely functional gameplay, and horrible business practices on part of the developer and publisher. This game makes me cry everytime I play it and yet I keep playing it - perhaps because I've invested so much money in it. The only fun I have anymore is with the music studio and recreating my favorite songs in it. This game has dried up and I strongly urge anyone who hasn't already tried it to avoid it. Just don't give yourself the headache that this game causes its players.
2737	1	a	This is a fun game if you get over the fact that high level players will pray on the low level players. I don't think that ruins the game though. I give this a 7/10.          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded - Reviews by Dr. Ubershadow&nbsp;
9949	1	a	Not a bad game by any means. It's fun, enjoyable, does get repetitive at times..but you spend no money on it out of the box, and there is no box.  Thing is, you can only craft one item at a time, before having to buy at least one thing, to get more slots. Can suck, as that's 'one item', not 'one stack of items'..
10669	1	a	got the game lost all matches  10/10
5079	0	a	This game sucks first of all i hate games where you have to log in its the gayest thing ever and it sucks. lots of problems when i finshed makeing my character it wounldnet let me join a game so this game sucks hate this waste of space do not download not worth it .
5163	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
5592	0	a	The launcher of this game was made by drunk two year olds.
5066	0	a	I CANT EVEN play please help me it keeps on telling me to restart the game or redownload it? i really would like to know how to play it wont let me even start it.
2709	1	a	An amazing game where a conflict cops/criminals is bloodly, there're a lot of action, in big districts, a lot of ingame hours !
10652	1	a	This game has been one of the best FPS games that I have ever played! It is free too, which is a great bonus. You could pay money if you want to get more classes or weapons faster, but when you start playing, it is really easy to get those! Highly recommend this game! 20/10
1725	1	a	this freaking game won`t work on my computer 
4185	0	a	I cannot remember EVER hating a game as much as this game. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had playing a video game. After reading the other bad reviews of the this worthless game, I don't feel it neccessary to go into details of why it's so bad, because the others did a good job of it. I just want to make sure that the idiots who made this game get another negative review. I only spent 5 dollars on this game and I have never wanted a refund for something this bad in my life. SKIP THIS GAME.
1762	1	a	Its a bigass download, but if its the same as it was a year ago imma play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game XD
59	1	a	i've played 'APB-RELOADED' for 3 and half years. Yet i still love this game. reasons i loving it: - Nice shooter game, graphics are cute but after new engine update it will be awesome game. - it's a very successful game for 6-GB little game :D - i can create what ever by the symbols for friends and customers and trade with g1c :D - All my Steam friends are from APB. i don't think u can find that awesome friends in different games :D - it's fun and funny at the same time. Pack of cheaDorrrs getting banned every day. Lucky ones will be punished too :P - Reffer friend stuffs are really saving free players but still free players can trade and be like a donator :3 - Lately they are making awesome g1c buyable packs, new items and getting well on it tho. so future items are brighter. - When you play for fun you enjoy the game. Play to win players never enjoys the game.  - Try to have fun no matter what happens in this virtual battlefield^^ &amp; you will love every thing in APB   (TO BE HONEST!)     Just reviewing this for Steam points.. TEHEhehe...   XD
6954	0	a	Don't touch this game unless you have friends (AND U GUYS PRBLY DONT LOL). It's completely and utterly garbage without it. No but seriously, this game is an utter mess, it's good fun with your friends but otherwise you deal with a toxic community, a questionable company and so many hackers that the braindead community can't distinguish between the real ones and players that just play a lot.
1405	1	a	i like the game but it just freezes for me when i play the game so yeah
3280	1	a	I recommend this game
10110	1	a	A lot to do for a new player. Very much like an online, not-so-gore-filled version of Fallout. As a F2P it is expected to be a heavy grinder or Pay for Premium deal. Where you can grind and spend more time to craft, level up abilities, and travel from place to place in game as opposed to a Premium member, but it makes up for it in pure in-game content and a fun post-apocalyptice free-to-play MMO-RPG. Bored often? Create a Fallen Earth account.

2829	1	a	This game is like gta 4 but online mmo. so you chose Criminal or Enforcer?
7478	0	a	Terrible game with terrible shooting mechanics.
6045	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.
5326	0	a	This is a purely pay to win game with an abundance of hackers and cheaters due to the ancient pre gears of war 1 engine its running on, the lack of xbox 360 controller support is sad. The engine is that porly optimised that many people complain of 'lag' due to the low en or mid range hardware that can handle other games but not this game. the game also lacks support for a modern directx or proper anti cheat, punk buster does not cut it people by pass it. in my opnion the 'engine upgrade they keep tossing around should remove the cheaters for a while untille the find new hacks and exploits. the main thing that kills the game for me is the lack of aussie servers and the extremly expensive guns on armas which are cheape for most people in europe and america who play. the thrill of kedding killed by some one with a permant op gun and premum membership + thier hacks is not a fun thing. plus the game gets repetative after a while the driving mechanics and the game physics are total rubbish. there is a desctingt lack of 3d postional audio, there are no 5.1 and 7.1 surrond sound options under audio settings this is terrible. my advice wait un till this so called engine update is relased before playing.
7053	0	a	i lunched iy 5 times and it did not lucnh and then i cant delete it so i dont like the game 
7427	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
1	1	a	I recommend this game for every masochist! APB:Reloaded features: - Crappy perfomance - Crappy servers - Crappy GMs - Idiots - Hackers - Pay to win After 2600 hours, I still can't stop! ( Help! )
646	1	a	gta multiplayer for people who like to be confused and die too much but it is free

151	1	a	Amazing game for a Free To Play
10713	1	a	Great game! Too bad the devs have decided not to support it. I fugure if I buy the game, the people who made it owe me a little consideration for the purchase.
6183	0	a	Once upon a time there were 2 boys named timmy and johnny. Timmy had found a awsome game he thought so he introduced that game to Johnny. Johnny was a bit skeptical at first but then he started to enjoy this game aswell. He had enjoyed the game so much he even put some money into the game. He thought wow this games character customization is so great but then he soon came to realize his stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing friend had made him oblivious to the fact that the game was such utter pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that he decided to uninstall and go back to CS:GO where the hackers were a dime a dozen but there was no pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t like APB had. People i am little Johnny, Dont make the same mistake i did. Dont waste your time or money thinking hey its gonna get better or hey this will be fun because not only is it pay to win there are lots of cheaters. Enjoy :)
853	1	a	Very fun game but needs some improvment
2891	1	a	Where do I even start with is game. you got guns. you got hip hop. and you got customization like you wouldnt even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing think possible. this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. you even wanna roll 4 deep with some homies and just shoot up â¥â¥â¥â¥? well in this game you can. need I say more?

4175	0	a	I would not recommend this game if you don't want cancer. I have 1500 + hours in this **** had to create new accounts to play, becaue after their launcher got destroyed, only steam was aviable, and you couldn't log into your account that was from the launcher. DON'T PLAY THIS PAY2WIN GAME. Pros : It was good in 2010-2012 no cheaters nothing, wasn't pay2win Cons: It began to be bad with lots of cheaters, micro transactions, bad engine, laggy servers, no updates just weapon and premium car skin ugrades, etc,,
5822	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.
7025	0	a	This game is broken, very little actual gameplay mostly just go from A to b to C and fight people with no clear objective. Cars feel like they are on ice. to get any acutal upgrades u need to pay. Most players cheat or are useing hacks. stay very far away from this game. 0/10
9612	1	a	This game is actually a very well-made game, The people who recently gave review to this game either has a horrible  PC or just can't stand a single second for minor bugs.  I've played this 2-3 years back and it was super fun. It may not have much players now, But its still the fun game i know and love,  I managed to make Soap Mactavish come to life in this game. Couldn't remember the username and password.. it was like 2-3 years ago, Can't blame me.  Either way, Its still a good game. It takes a special person to enjoy this wonderful piece of work. Everyone who disliked this most probably isn't a special kind and just throws in a bad review to make it look bad. Don't worry, This game will be revived sooner or later filled with players,   i'll come back here one day with a ton of players joining me. It only takes a few players to make this game big again, So i ask you.. are you up for the challenge?
7367	0	a	The loading takes so long and the updates are terrible. Control scheme is horrible and even on high graphics isn't the most good looking of games. Also Gameplay is not really that fun and the Character Creation is horrible and sometimes not fuctioning proberly. You might as well get money in your steam wallet and buy any of the GTA's out there.
5299	0	a	It is a pile of wank........ Stop buying in-game guns if you have already and use the money to buy a p*rnhub subscription, Becuase if you have wasted money on in-game guns those are probably the only t*ts you will see for a long while
1377	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!  Runs awesome  plays awesome

9608	1	a	Been a pleasent suprise been looking at it for ages and decided why not! It turns out its a very fun game! also the crafting and pvp is very good fun!
7329	0	a	I want to like this game. It has the potential to be fun. It's mechanics are great. The idea behind it amazing. But alas, it lacks the one thing any PVP game requires: Balance. It advertises a tutorial server that doesn't exist, so you're tossed into the thick of things to learn the game. It doesn't tell you controls, mission types, or anything of the sort, and the worst of it all is the utter lack of balance. A fresh off the boat character will be matched against gold level players wielding rocket launchers and LMG's that may as well be classified as ranged chainsaws. It's not newbie friendly at all, and it doesn't give you a chance to learn the game before putting you against people who live and breath the game. I can't recommend this, as much as I want to enjoy it.
6230	0	a	Bad game. Long Loading times.GTA clone
1924	1	a	Customizations are similar (in the aspect of making your character) if not better than the Saints Row series. You can create unlimited customizations when it comes to clothing, decals for your vehicles, how you dress, etc. This game really brings out the inner-self and really allows you to express yourself through a video game. You can create 8-bit songs that are used for your theme when you kill a player, thus they can hear that little song every time they die from you.  You can also add mods to your guns and to yourself. This helps you by killing the opposition that much quickly. The combat is fun and fluid â very fast, aggressive, and determined to finish off your opponent in a timely manner by any means necessary (e.g. sniper, grenades, rocket launcher, running them down via vehicle, etc.). The game is like GTA/SR having a child with a MMO. The game is rather big and has numerous districts all which have their own quests and purpose that pertains to each district.   There is a social district where you can go to buy stuff from the local auction house, customize your own gear, socialize with other members of APB, and chillax after a few rounds of fast, paced gameplay.
2929	1	a	One of the best MMO Third-Person FPSs that are out there! You are separated into criminals and enforcers, a.k.a. the police. It is basically GTA with all the epic car explosions, absolute chaos in the streets around every corner, and co-op mission style based to achieve all objectives before the other team. It is a must try game! :D
7606	0	a	This game is more then just pay to win, it's pay to play. Your cash rewards, experience, and so forth are all dramatically reduced if you don't buy their VIP. It's not just that though, they refuse to make any new guns that you can actually unlock in the game. Every new gun is one you have to pay for! Not a single new gun has been released to public aviablilty since the restart of the actual game from APB, All Points Bulletin. If that doesn't make it bad enough, to truely enjoy yourself in the game you need to be a VIP. Why? Better and longer trials for weapons and cars, not to mention the ability to customize yourself and vehicle, emblems, and more to higher extents. The only game worse then this with a worse pay to win system is WarZ now known as 'Infestation Stores.' It is though fun to play once you're a high enough level, hackers are dealt with much easier now because of the anti-hack system known as Fair Fight was installed. There's without a doubt of equalization in weapons, but that equalization is in the ones you pay for. The graphics aren't bad, controls, mechanics, and interest isn't bad at all actually. From climbing ladders to driving off ramps from unfinished highways, civilians actively moving about the map to simply running over criminals or enforcers to catching criminals in acts of crime. There's a lot of innovation, tons of little areas to be found even when you think you know all the maps and secret locations. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the pay to win system this would be without a doubt the greatest game ever made. It's like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (the original for Xbox 360.) You can steal a civilan car for the lulz of it, or make your own from a fairly wide range of choices and if you decide to dump cash into this game that customization can truely be starstriking. I've never seen a game with more customization options in my life. If this game allowed you to unlock everything over time it'd be an absolute reccommendation, but it not only doesn't try to do this but HEAVILY avoids it. Potential never met.  Did I mention they made it so you have to buy upgrades for your friend and ignore list, or that new content is never given to those who don't pay...?
6498	0	a	Fun game ruined by hackers
9480	1	a	Like on other guy said. Clans need to be able to build their own base as they want. Its an post apocaliptic game. Having the ability to build a home in a ruinned place would be awesome other than that its a bit boring
8318	0	a	3rd party â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2003	1	a	I think this is a sort of gta 5 style game thirdperson customise and much more you get missions guns and lots !!  I would rate this 10/10
8417	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
2262	1	a	great game this is i like better then gta
8295	0	a	only a few words to describe it   â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wasted my time and money shouldve played dota or  someshit than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game    KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK DEV
7456	0	a	Imbalanced Pay2Win game with a lot of potential, only pay when you have the cash to invest! If you really do it can be loads of fun, watch out for griefers though.
10182	0	a	overall boring and difficult to really get into, the FPS elements are there but just not nearly refined enough to really attract a serious fan base other than people who have awesome computers to run it at maximum..With the release of it on Steam the bugs and server issues have gotten much much worse, and lag and really low Frame rates is more than common. Generally i give this game a 4/10 good idea, good back ground, great presentation, but poor game play, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor mechanics
2039	1	a	great game
9062	0	a	it isnt really free. when i downloaded it it just made me make an account for some other game engine. it also dowloads other things that arent even associated to it. do not get this game!
2201	1	a	10/10 good for kids who arent old enough for gta yet i started playing this in 4th grade i played the crap out of it this game is technically almost like gta online but this came first some parts simular some parts not seriously try this game amazing best game of 2011-2014
6623	0	a	Laggy gameplay, car physics broken, seemingly bad input lag, under average shooting mechanics. There are better free games out there than this.
10632	1	a	Rip i guess. I didn't really play it that much.
7441	0	a	Laggy, kicks you off of your server up to 15 times an hour, waste of space unless you have a VERY fast computer.

10596	1	a	Fast, skillfull, easy to master. Awesome
8901	1	a	Post Appocalypt Earth caused by Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Zombies. being the first MMO I actually Liked, going into towns and helping peopled was a realy sattisfying experience. But then I ran into delema's with the main story where you are not a single man army. This game will probably be more fun if you work in packs or join a guild, Also, this game isn't free if you, it's just got a free mode that used to be sweet. It still is sweet, but a sometime after the release of the free edition, they removed the ability to have craft ques for free players.
3545	1	a	Would waste 3000 hours again, 1/10.
5447	0	a	The game started out fun, but getting deeper into it, you begin to see the inconsistencies of what it claims to be, and what it actually is. There's no denying how awesomely customizable everything is in the game, down to character creation, outfits, vehicles, what have you. The problem I ran into, is the overwhelming number of people hacking the game, prolonging their own lives and auto-aiming. Once you put two and two together, you realize you're only one of a handful of legitimate players, competing against a troupe of people who just wanna be successful in a video game, even if it means cheating. I'd check this off your list, because there's no rescue coming.
9746	0	a	this is by far the stupidest and biggest waste of time i have ever played. the original super mario has better graphics and physics than this game and its just so freakn complicated its ridiculous. dont waste ur time on this game

147	1	a	very good game and fun you can create your own man and disigne the car as you wish for amazing game
10116	1	a	This game as a single-player experience is rather bland and pointless, however, the exploration factor is cool.   PRO TIP: Play this game with friends. Call them on the phone and play it together from the start. The character build is pretty cool, but beware the fact that you can't change your character, so try not to have the same characters as each other.   Clans are completely pointless. Unless you have a friend-base of 10 people to make a clan with, there's no point.   Missions aren't so bad, but cooperative exploration is amazing in my opinion.  Other than that, it's not a bad game. I wish there were more games like this though

6615	0	a	played this game before it was on steam and left cameback after awhile and left for good this time. This game is   HEAVILY   p2w it seems like, you have your 3 districts 2 fighting disctricts and 1 social district and you have fight club maps, the 'rank' system is based off of losing and winning which is dumb because if you go against p2w players you will lose you won't even have a chance the servers are kindaorienated towards your 'rank' you have green servers bronze servers and so on the hackers ruined this game p2w really ruined it not to mention all the lag respawn sometimes seems like it takes forever and fight club matches are extremely hard because of the lag and p2w players all the guns you get with in-game currency go away after a few days so yeah don't waste your time with it. -100/10
4112	0	a	Best Idea: replace gamersfirst, call an actually good company like RockStar or Bioware. The game is truly amazing, 5 dollars in and It is so much fun. but gamersfirst has GOT to go, RockStar or Bioware would have the best time with this as it is a bootiful game but gamersfirst got high while driving it and crashed the train, leaving many people dead (banned), injured (dissapointed), and scarred emotionally (turned into the toxic community we all know and hate today).
6720	0	a	This is practically a sucky knockoff of Grand Theft Auto for free-to-plays. The graphics are bad, there is little to keep the player interested for long, customization is limited (unlike Saints Row), there are few game modes, and it feels repetetive. The only redeeming quality is that it is free. 12/100.
4895	0	a	If you like paying money to boost your ego then this is probably thÃ© best game for you.
234	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
7225	0	a	i dont like it, you shouldn't either          don't ask why
10336	1	a	Ok so many things wrong with this game even for early access, Graphics need's alot of work things look really bland to me, maybe look at borderlands concept art or fallout big thing these teams did was take pictures lots of pitures of real life places. Google is a good cheap alternative the horse was modeled really well, clearly had photo reference. Character movement is clunky and your always getting caught on stuff like stairs and doors, try using a low res UV Sphere the collision detection is well old and outdated for modern games. Another option is to put an invisible ramp on stair's and make the box smaller cuz right now it barely fits through the doors. This is my biggest complaint with the game and is something that should be fixible easily if the code is well written. I create a new method for all object in the game and it subsequent object's and states so they can easily be called and tracked. So a player chacter would be one class and everything it needs to make it work is in that class. each part of the character is then section out like arm bone move is in one method collision detection and its position is tracked by that method. Lessons learned from the masters john carmak's books as well Brenda Romaro A.K.A (Brenda Brathwaite) has alot of good books wolfgang engel would be another too look at, he is one of the top graphics programmers in the world. Other then those two massive issues it looking real good for early access and runs pretty well. I will be checking in for the movement fix;

10805	1	a	What if I told you there was a game that had a unique travel mechanic called skiing and team based battle matches? Well, this is it. Ascend is definitely for those who want to play Multiplayer. With it being free-to-play the microtransactions can cause pay to win problems. The game is definitly more fun with friends.   Pros:     Decient Multiplayer Experience     Decient number of Classes/Perks     Character/class EXP persistance between matches     Weapon Upgradability     FREE-ish (Ingame microtransactions)     Fast adrenaline pumping action via unique skiing-mechanic     Arena maps with different game modes (CTF, Team death match, etc)  Cons:     No SinglePlayer (No Offline, minimun free account required)     Pay to Win (Unless you're good enough)     Things bought with ingame currency is WAY to expensive vs the real money alternative  Final Suggestion:   Try it out!!

10072	1	a	there are zombies and the game is first person and third person u also start with some wepons like a sniper and axe download it
6747	0	a	haha...yes there are screenshots and videos, when it comes to the game, lets take a seat and discuss things...  first, you download the game from steam.  second you have to install the company's gaming site (their version of steam).  third you must download the game from their site.  fourth you must install another version of Gamers Live   fifth you realize you spent three days downloading two versions of a game that when started runs error codes which have no repairs except reinstall the game  sixth you spend a couple of hours searching through the programs to uninstall it after you uninstalled it  seventh you find that to this day it continues to run in your background ._.

8153	0	a	I would not recommend this game. If you're not willing to cough up the money, then the game isn't that fun. As either a Criminal or an Enforcer, you get mauled by others before you even get a chance to try to learn how to play. If you're new, then no one wants you. For me, probably because of my location from the server, it lags. This has a big impact. If it lags even a tiny bit, and makes it so you can't aim straight, or drive the car correctly, let's just say, 'It's not fun.' So, unless you don't have any lag at all, you can pick up how to play in the first few minutes, and you're willing to cough up the cash or barely get anywhere, then all the luck to you.
9138	1	a	its great guys
9786	0	a	This game is so bad. I know why its free. Its so slow, and the controls are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed that its hard to move around. Has on be one of the worst games that I have played.
8321	0	a	not worth 0$
10790	1	a	Pretty good game considering how old it is.
2591	1	a	Good game,but need a strong computer :) I hasn't it.. :( but I working for it :))
9122	0	a	I came, I saw, I uninstalled.  Though you CAN shoot from horseback, so there's that.
9135	0	a	The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics. At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this? But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥. The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me. The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ vampire love story for teens. Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission. I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.  Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.
4565	0	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this pay2win game!!!!!!!
7637	0	a	This game would be one of the best games out there and one of the most fun games you could possible play with friends. However. It is not. Simply because it is so much pay-to-win from the moment you enter that it becomes a matter of who has the more money. missions are fought against other players and since the game is so pay-to-win It is impossible to properly play for a person who can not buy weapons from the real-money stores. Weapons that includes a sniper which you can jump with and thus be rather agile. One shot to the head with that thing and you are pretty much dead.  It is a very fun game but Pay-to-Win kills it shortly after you start. Sure its possible that you come up against people who does not have these kinds of weapons. But most of the time you will have to deal with Pay-to-Win people as soon as you hit gold ranks  Unless you want to pay for weapons that are overpowered compared to what non-paying players can get. I'd suggest you pass on this game. That is my opinion.
8530	0	a	It's got no controller support, a bunch of high priced DLC, and is just a mess.  I know it's free, but when getting rated, free games don't get a pass just because they can installed, and uninstalled at will. They are games that need to be rated. They don't deserve a free pass.
10354	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
7385	0	a	GamersFirst is a terrible moneygrabbing company. Despite APB:Reloaded having fun gameplay and a good somewhat worthwhile (and repetetive) experience it is a 'Pay to Win' multiplayer game, where the more money you put into it the more you'll be favoured in-game. Be warned, if you do decide to pay to win, they can and most likely will take your privelages away with a delicious ban, it happened to the infamous me, twice.   Play this game at your own risk, feel free to play it even more when it's taken over by a different company that's somewhat more involved with their community.
758	1	a	a lot of bad reviews just get it i had an amazingly fun time just bring some friends ;)
10099	1	a	This game is awesome you get skills like in maplestory and you get to make your own guns and armor and vechiles 
2452	1	a	it is hoorrrible trash.it keeps saying i need the D3D9 device or something.and, i cant even play on ONE server because it says i need some device or whatever. so my rating is negative 1 out of ten.

10721	1	a	Tribe: Ascend is one of the best games I have every toucheD with my big intErnet hAnds, THis game is a masTer piece tO all of man kind, THE game play is very UNIque and I lOve how sniping is Nearly impossible, this game is a classic and everyone should own this in their library, mainly because it's free and ranks up your steam acount. This has been a review from your friendly neighborhood neckbeard.
6269	0	a	The game wouldnt get past the splash screen. Yeah I googled that you could run the exe by itself, but even then it took a very long time to actually load so I didnt bother...
3108	1	a	the best game but kicking me all time plz fix it

6978	0	a	Now, this game is really fun and has lots of stuff packed into the game and I can clearly see lots of work has been put into this game. However,   Pros: -Very costumizable cars -Lots of clothes and accessories -Really fun missions -Very fun gameplay  Cons: -Horrible lag -Missions are very repetitive and have little variety   Other than that, this game is really fun.  8/10 would lag again.

4686	0	a	- Pay to Win - Matchmaking Unfair - VAC Suck - A lot of hackers - Never Update - Old Events
2728	1	a	From a totally honest standpoint, I had my objections when I downloaded this game, I thought 'Will this be a pay2win?, Will there be uneven player matches, Will there be hard quests and laggy servers?' Well of course. being the APB is a one of a kind MMO, it's bound to have so many negative features, but what game out there doesn't?  APB Reloaded is an action packed third-person POV game that makes you really on strategy, teamwork, and gear, and although there is a pay2win aspect, you don't need to buy gear just to be a great player. The missions do get repetitive, and it seems like the characters all give you similar quests, which is a downside, but the multiplayer integration goes along well, and most matches have several parts facing you off with opposing forces.  The game is glitchy, to be expected, but it isn't terrible. There is not much lag, and the ragdoll physics are a personal favorite of mine. One thing I do have to say that bugs me is if your car is going about 70 mph or 5000 km/h and you eject, the game gives no â¥â¥â¥â¥s and you get out unphased. Please fix  Overall, it's a quite smooth, relaxing game, that's really good to play with friends. A big tip to getting famouse would be to make and sell whatever products you make. Always take requests and form alliences at the social districts, or in missions. And lastly, just have fun. Don't let what people tell you to persuade you to not pick up this game, it's a good waste of a few gigs. So see for yourself. If you found my review helpful, please thumbs it up and let others see how good this game is.

6199	0	a	When you first play this game your immediate idea is 'Aww yeah. I'm going to be a bad*** robber.' Sadly the curtain falls away to reveal the issues with the game. The fact you constantly have to buy guns or shell out a fair bit of cash to have a perm gun. The vechiles vary greatly which is awesome but again you often times have to shell out real money for the good things. The game play is sad. Basicly meaning anyone who pays the money for the best gear is probably going to win.   All in all it was fun for a short bit but after a while the zeal subsides.
7471	0	a	Game is okay.... And that's being generous. That being said, the worst part of APB Reloaded is that it's pretty much pay-to-win. That is, a supposedly free-to-play game having players pay real money to get the most out of the game.
9065	1	a	Really great game.I don't see why people are complaining about the graphics.I like them actually.Gameplay is a bit diffficult to get the hang up at first,but it catches.Still kind of strange how you need to hold right click to change your view while not in aiming mode.But,I digress.Still a really great game.9/10.Just wish that some of the missions were straightforward,telling you exactly what you have to do,and being a bit more simple,instead of multiple paragraph essays.Still,really fun game.
6239	0	a	Does it spread cancer? â Does it ruin your life? â Do you get called a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every time you kill someone? â Does it have 255 level players with grenade launchers? â Is that grenade launcher op as â¥â¥â¥â¥? â Does it give AIDS? â Do you still want to play even though this game is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥? â

10782	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is a lot of things: difficult, confusing, hard to get into, and overall dead. However, once you figure out the complexities of the movement system, the team play, the game itself, then it has to be the most rewarding video game I've ever had the joy of playing.  The simplest way to describe the movement is free form. There are the simple routes most people take, but once you know the ins and outs of your capabilities, its an endless sandbox of potential. The use of grenade and rocket boosts can change a player's trajectory and elevation, but usually is used for the speed to catch opposing enemies or to speed through their base, and by god, once you hit past 250, you will know what true happiness feels like. The exhilaration of gliding through the huge maps the game has to offer is incredible, using your time in the air to guide your character from slope to slope, bringing the flag home or taking down the opposing team's flag carrier.  I would have begged anybody give this truly free to play game (Oh yeah, that's another good point too) if I made this review two years ago, but now, the community is dead. There are usually one and a half to two servers that have activity in them, so people wont get the same satisfaction as before, which is the worst part of this masterpiece. This game shoud've never died, and I hope HiRez finds the time to make another installment.
6143	0	a	Most Pay2Win game I've played.
2416	1	a	Such a great game, play it, I recomend it!
7055	0	a	Gets boring after a while... You have to work for a quite a long time to achive what you wanna have. The only thing I like is that you can really put a lot into making your characters. Kinda like The Sims 4 at that point, but poorer.
3472	1	a	Ive played since it was first made by Realtime Worlds and its come a long way and its one of the best games ive played. The hackers are no longer an issue ever since they implemented fair fight. Makes a huge differance in gameplay now. I would highly recommend this game now.

8122	0	a	In this game you will only meet kids who spend their money for stupid things...  This game is full of guys with OP guns...You cant do nothing to them...You must atleast empty up to 3-4 magazines to kill them while they kill you in 2-3 hits...  Game was great at the beginning but later it really becomes unplayable.. The only good thing is Character/Symbol Creator and nothing else... I dont recommend this game cuz it sucks...  0/10 Not worth installing...

4087	0	a	Just changed my review from recommended to absolute piece of crap. They recently did a server merge that makes the game unplayable becasue of ms instability. Not sure if I should be delighted that I can't play this game anymore.
10693	1	a	got the game lost all matches  10/10
10774	1	a	I played as the standard soldier class for days worth of hours until I finally got tired. I then switched to another class and it was like I was playing a completely different game! Not to mention the fact that it's free-to-play.  A fresh take on first person shooters, Tribes is definitely worth it. I do wish there was some form of single-player, though
8750	0	a	I wouldn't force Hitler to play this game.
8922	0	a	game was awesome but the fact is, that today the game is dead and the fact that someone hacked into my clan, disbanded it and took all my stuff that was into the clan vault, i would get them off and put on my vault but my vaults were full, don't play this game because you'll find nothing but idiots and sometimes trolls, and if you go to PVP, you must be one of the 'terror raiders' otherwise you'll be overwhelmed, because almost every pvper in the game is in that damn clan today
7867	0	a	This game has a lot of potential when it leaves it's alpha state, but for now, it's clunky, confusing, and unforgiving. Dong not expanded.
4582	0	a	For the love of god, don't play this game..
5240	0	a	This is honestly my first serious review... I wrote a review awhile back, but I felt the need to write a serious one cause this game's gotten even worse than before. At the time of the review, I had 111.7 hrs. And I know it's still counting and all, but this game is actually a real piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.   Let's get down and dirty. Pros:  Gameplay is decent  Lots of customization (I spent around 60 hours just trying to customize my crap so I looked sugoi as f*ck),  Absolutely and ridiculously fun with friends. (Honestly, and thing is fun with friends... I have no friends. this is a lie.)  Cons: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Company â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ optimization â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hackers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ b*llshit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Anti-cheat (One review said False ban for hack? Like ffs) â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Service (Automated replies. No help at all.)  I'm for sure gonna keep playing this game, cause I freaking love the customizations in it, but I really recommend you stay as far away from this game as possible. You gotta work for the money, and working for the money is complete hell because of all those cons up there.  TL:DR This game should literally kill itself.
1806	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
1286	1	a	is good i met 2pac he wasnt very nice tho
9959	1	a	Not a bad game, it is free to play so of course the better items cost money to buy. Just like the turbine games such as Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons. Other than that fault, the game is just about like any other MMO. This one has a Fallout taste to it being set in a post apocalypse world. The main down side is the crafting can take a lot of time to do unless you pay to remove the limit.
464	1	a	Good Game 10/10  -Mugging People -Ram Shop -Good graphic -Cool Weapons -Cool Cars
8105	0	a	Bunch of greedy developers with no support for it's community.
1083	1	a	Amazing game with great development. Only issues are many hackers and a very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mathcmaking setup 
8426	0	a	Has the worst matchmaking i've ever seen
4836	0	a	I have spent countless hours on this game wasting a little over a thousand dollars on it (I'm crying) and everything was great until Fairfight was introduced now this isn't the same Fairfight from battlefield, this is the $5 version of Fairfight, basically what it does is it bans you from hack reports and your K/D ratio so if you do good your going to get reported for 'hacking' and you will get banned.. that's what happpened to me now for the sake of your life don't play this game!
3456	1	a	All time favorite game. Especially when my teamates are bronze new players, And the opposition is the highest ranked golds, and they have P2W weapons
8855	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥, i payed for this game, then it just removed online, couldnt play it, it came back as free and is slowly dying. Don't even deserve to be downlaoded
3315	1	a	A good GTA like game that has a lot of customizations but it is multiplayer. A lot of missions and contacts that are fun to play with. But there are many hackers in the game which sucks. But it is really an awesome game after all. I will recommend this game to open-world gaming fans. :)
10340	0	a	Character customization is decent. Concept is good. Default keybinds are not intuitive, and make switching weapons clunky - especially since there's no way to draw two one-handed weapons at once. Skill/AP system looks shiny enough, but there is no apparent in-game info on what's most beneficial/what should be focused on - ask on the help channel, and you get pointed to the wiki site. I'd rather be able to play the game than spend all day doing research on a wiki. Combat is awkward, with targeting being off to one side of the character rather than in front, and the hitboxes seem off sometimes. Running away/kiting doesn't seem to be a viable option, as melee enemies are able to hit you from several feet away - you'll just die tired.  Found the game on a top 20 MMO list, decided to give it a try. Was excited to find there might be an RP element, but never saw any of that in-game - might be difficult as a F2P player to RP anyway, since there's no access to public channels? Must be at least a 'Freemium' player for that.
2082	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. I need a life.
10674	1	a	Since HiRez *FINALLY* released a patch for this game, after two whole years, I figured it was time to patch my review. While everyone figured they abandoned the game (which, they pretty much did for a while there), they came out of no where with this new patch. And it puts the feel of the old school Tribes games back in. Gone are the individual classes, back with just the light/medium/heavy sets and customizable loadouts. There's been a slew of quality improvements as well as a couple new maps. I definitely feel like I'm playing a graphically and mechanically updated version of the beloved Starsiege Tribes from the late 90s, which is fantastic. A lot of F2P games get you with their IAPs and P2W, but even HiRez has admitted they're not going to make money off this patch. They've basically given the old players everything in the game completely unlocked. You shouldn't spend more than $10 on the game unless you're just impatient, as it appears everything (except armor skins and voice packs) are unlockable via XP. I can't not recommend this game to fans of the FPS genre, because the bottom line is it's just that good.
2230	1	a	nice game buy i dont know how to buy colision? ! â¢ 
774	1	a	Great game with a lot of potential. Great customisation of your character, cars, clothing etc. There are some hackers on the game but it is pretty rare. The game is very addicting and once you get into the game it is pretty hard to quit. There are only 2 maps and you pretty much do the same missions which can get a bit boring but pretty fun. The ARMAS marketplace is constantly releasing new micro transactions or in game items which is maybe good on the one hand but also pretty bad in the other. Although the main thing is APB's player base which is pretty low and maybe even considered as dying off. All in all i think the game is great with a lot of ptential although has some major cons.
4967	0	a	THSIO GA Eme is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ its so awful
999	1	a	Awesome game but if they could make the requirstemt little lower for lower pc or laptops.
8367	0	a	This game has good customization, and okay gameplay. it however has one of the worst communitys in gaming history, somewhere between ark and LoL. i tried one mission recently and it was easily greifed by a high level player that kept killing us. why can you even kill your own teammates during a mission vital for leveling up? thats just asking for trolls.  on top of that if you want anythign beyond the starter that isn't clothes, be prepared to dish out real money. and they're not cheap. and they're not permenent. so you pay $20 for a gun that only last 90 days at max, and the time costs extra. the guns you get from ingame currency are only 7 days max, so pretty much worthless.  the fact that a high and max level player can join a level 1 mission is also what ruins the game. imagine trying to win a mission thats supposed to be easy agenst a player with a rocketlauncher that one hits you. thats this game in a nutshell.
160	1	a	i absolutely love this game
8859	1	a	Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said 'screw you' to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE.  CATEGORY 1: Graphics Now the graphics AREN'T FALLOUT LEVEL. They're about average MMORPG...Like ArcheAge or TERA. Yes, you can set your graphics really high and I get about 50-60 frames on Highest, and when I lower about 110-120 FPS. They can use some work, but I noticed if you turn your graphics down even slightly, you loose A LOT of really nice detail that they put in there for fine polishing.  CATEGORY 2: Gameplay (Combat, Movement, PvP, PvE) Gameplay is...it's...it's alright. The combat is either 1st or 3rd person; and personally I would rather go 3rd. 1st person is extremely wierd and awkward, and rather dull as well. Now, as for movement- THE MAPS...IN THIS GAME...ARE SO FREAKING HUGE. I SWEAR. TO GOD. They split them up into 'Sectors,' and the last being 'Alpha County' which is basically the end game area. Now, that being said, you can ATTEMPT to run there. However, I tried to get from Sector 1 to Sector 2, and didn't pack enough feed for my horse. I was left STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE with a horse that eventually DIED on me (No it didn't literally, but it may as well have with the speed it was going). So, if you're going between Sectors, be sure to grab a mount. But what I would LOVE to commend G1 for doing here is I have never...NEVER...IN MY LIFE..EXPERIENCED A LOADING SCREEN TRAVELLING. Only will you ever for teleporting and loading INTO the game. Travelling is loading-screen free, along with dungeons as well.  -Mounts in the game are very nice to have and can be pricey at times, but they're well worth the buy. You have two types of mounts, machines and natural. Natural covers things like horses and some kick-â¥â¥â¥ massive wolves you can ride on. And no they aren't your stereotypical wimpy â¥â¥â¥ wolves. These things are H-U-G-E and well worth getting in the quest line that you complete to get them (yes, you can actually get mounts through questlines; GOOD ONES not just starter ones). Machines covers ATV's, Bikes, Buggies, and Cars. But, the higher tier you get on mounts, THEY ARE GOD-AWFUL TO TAKE CARE OF. Be ready to spend some in-game cash to take care of them, 'cause some use 'premium' fuel.  -PvP in the game is fairly decent, involving some ethics of 'skill' and dodging. However, if you want PvP, it is HORRIBLY balanced. Rifleman and snipers are left in the dark, along with some longer range classes while melee is the way to go. Oh, and you think carrying a massive club around is going to get you where you want? HELL NO. Yeah, you have the OCCASIONAL good heavy melee weapon that can get the job done; but no, you'll be faced with a load of VERY....VERY...VERY fast DPS melee weapons that literally shred you. So for PvP, get some very fast dual pistols or duel machetes/knives.  -PvE/Questing is nice in the game and is pretty alright. However, questing can get..repetitive. 'RUN HERE, SHOOT THIS, RUN BACK, TURN IT IN. DONE.' Now, there are the exceptional quests that do have you doing some pretty cool things such as setting explosives on a vehicle or hunting down massive bosses. And the bosses in this game are VERY...VERY hard to beat without a group. Other than that...Not really much else for questing. I commonly found myself GRINDING THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of high level enemies just to rank up. Took me HOURS and loads of cash for ammunition.   CATEGORY 3: Community The community is alright, but nothing different from any other MMO community out there. You're going to have those OBVIOUS dickwads and terrible people. Hell, you will even FIGHT...LITERALLY FIGHT over loot sometimes. Seriously...fk that. Even then, on GLOBAL channels people are being harassed. I had to step in once and tell someone to back off, which then lead to me reporting these asshats to the online GM (Game Moderator). Their accounts were issued a warning. Don't hope for the best from this community, 'cause you ain't gon'na receive â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Now....now comes the Pay-to-Play/Pay-to-Win. N-O. All things you will get to buff up your character is IN GAME. The only thing in this 'cash shop' is going to be cosmetics and SOME boosts such as EXP. Overall, a fun game, good setting, terribad community, decent cash shop. â¥â¥â¥â¥ TRAVELLING BY FOOT. IN. THE. â¥â¥â¥â¥.  EDIT: Funny Things in the game &gt;Running around in a speedo with a gasmask on. &gt;Crafting horses. With Kits. That's right. There's a kit to craft a horse. Oh and one more thing, this game, as it is made by Gamers First, MAY NOT WORK ON SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS. I don't know what is wrong with it but sometimes these games just don't want to work.

122	1	a	The game mechanics are good, but the best thing about it is how much idiotic fun it is with friends. A large part of the enjoyment comes from goofing off with friends and just not taking it seriously. I highly recommend this game if you want some good fun with your friends. And it's free, so you can't beat that.
3451	1	a	great game
8336	0	a	I played this game quite a bit a ways back, I think about 6 months ago. And then I stopped.. I don't remember what frustrated me so much that I stopped, so I decided to give it another go. 1. EXTREMELY long load times. 2. disconnection problems (VERY BAD). we're talking every 2 or 3 minutes getting disconnected and dealing with 4 minutes worth of loading to get fully connected again, just to be disconnected 2 or 3 minutes later once again. 10 disconnects in 1 hour, total play time 11 minutes maybe in 1 hour, 20 minutes in 2 hours?? SOOOOO BUGGY!!! I tried using steam to verify installation, and then I also did the repair option on the APB launcher.. 5 times. Have not found it to fix the problem of constantly disconnecting from the game every 2 or 3 minutes. Makes the game completely un-playable for me. What a complete waste of 2 hours for me trying to get any play time on this. Seriously BUGGED. They have had PLENTY of time to fix the problems with this game, but it's performance indicates that they have no intention to. Back months &amp; months ago it was LESS buggy than it is now. I actually have 240 hours logged on this game from back then. It was still buggy then, but less so. However, they must have screwed something else up since then. Others may not have the same problems as me, but is unplayable for me due to constant disconnects.... something I am not experiencing with other game titles.
9850	1	a	This is one of those mission type/salvaging MMO's. I really enjoy this one. If you donât have this game, get it. Though if you have a normal computer, I would recommend you change the game graphic settings to their absolute lowest. If you do that, should be fine, otherwise you will rage quit from lagging to the point where you die from it. Because it is a 100% online game (no single player mode), most of the high end graphics is not needed.  Over all I really like this game. The lay out is great, I can play for hours at a time, and there are hundreds of achievements to try and unlock.  (8.9 out of 10)
8822	0	a	It's a fun game however lacks updates and fixes. The map becomes boring after a few hours of playing, and is certainly pay to win.
7517	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
9653	1	a	
6229	0	a	ok first of all this game was intresting at first then there was lots of glitches with the missions because u only can play multiplayer y u no offline &gt;.&lt;
10165	1	a	A Cool F2P Apocalypse game!
6161	0	a	only P2W, unfair enemies and cheaters !!! this is what I think about this game 0/10 or -10/10 :(
401	1	a	I would really recommend this game because it is very fun and very addicting. The game does have a few bugs and gliches in which the game might start to lag out or freeze completely but over all it is a very good game. A addicting and challenging one with a comptetitive twist. Game on.
1823	1	a	its good
5807	0	a	trying ot get it to work the struggle is real
680	1	a	I've yet to spend a single cent of real monney in this game but I still have fun.
1059	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
4961	0	a	well having about 400 hours on the game and spending approx. $200 i get banend for 'cheating' and after that its just horrible, game is only focused on irl $ and without $ theres no fun to it
5954	0	a	Lagspikes even on Minimal settings (changing video settings hardly even matter) when I can run high quality games from 2014-2015.   - Bad engine. - Mostly p2w. - Boring missions. - Toxic community.  I regret spending 240+ hours on this game.
708	1	a	UPDATED REVIEW AGAIN: Once Again
6702	0	a	Haven't played APB for 2 years now. I didn't remember much, besides that my expreience with the game was positive. It was fun.  Now, two years later, I downloaded it and I was very disappointed. The game haven't changed much. Same old problems are still there. Some things became even worse. APB eats up all my RAM for breakfast and freezes after several minutes of gameplay.   It was such a promising project at first, now it's just another failed MMO. 
2598	1	a	This game is amazing, especially for a free to play game! I love knowing APB Reloaded is here waiting for me to return home from a long day of work. Whenever I turn on the game it whispers my name telling me to never leave again or it'll delete itself off of my pc :'(
9658	0	a	NEVER EVER PLAY THIS GAME  it sucks so much that every time u try to play it it always says : app already running. ive tried everything to exit it it i tried deleting it but it says its still running. ive tried exiting completly then going back on to delete it that didnt work either. plz friends dont get this game
2545	1	a	It's a bit frustrating at times, but over all alot of fun, and with a nice set of customizable options too! :D

5507	0	a	ughhh 
1267	1	a	I like APB:R because you could make your character as cute as possible or make it look ugly but anyway its a cops vs crims and APB:R have the best advanced customizing for characters but the only thing i dont like about it because their always have to be someone complaining or calling out hackers and stuff like that.    APB:R is a cool game for steam :D
8650	0	a	GTA but online. Super fun. Download it!  Edit:  I used to love this game, but it has been ruined by G1. The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.
9513	0	a	as much as i like this game it not the game i would play i could not even start the game i got to the char part and that was it no play
3051	1	a	Funny game. Get's boring after awhile since the missions are the same. Alot of hackers once you are gold threat.
1220	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥!
9488	0	a	Very difficult to get your bearings set from the beginning. There isn't much of an in-game tutorial to help you ease into it. Quests seemed standard 'kill X of Y in zone Z' or 'gather/craft X of Y'. The combat system is crazy weird to me, and I cant even begin to describe the crafting system... The fact that its Post-Apoc wasteland is about the only thing this game has in common with Fallout. I feel as though the game HAS potential, but that alone doesnt merit a good game. Implementation and execution on things seemed lacking. I uninstalled without a second thought.  I didn't play it for long, so I speak on a very limited experience, but I still wouldn't suggest this mess of a game on anyone.
8598	0	a	The best game ever, this game not only takes up room in your hard drive, it doesn't even start! Get your free trial today.
5057	0	a	I CANT EVEN play please help me it keeps on telling me to restart the game or redownload it? i really would like to know how to play it wont let me even start it.
5401	0	a	nice game but bad graphics...
7981	0	a	People with premium weapons usually win this game. noobs get matched against experienced players constantly. Overall, not a very good f2p game
9190	0	a	Its bad, confusing in start, playbase is â¥â¥â¥â¥
2826	1	a	Like GTA? Basically just like it but as an MMO. Really fun to troll as well lol
3345	1	a	Great game, ruined by hackers. Fairfight only gets a few. =\ I still think it's a great game for other features.
956	1	a	this game. it is great with some minor flaws the biggest flaw being that it is very brutal on new players if you havent played 100-200 hours do not expect to be any good what so ever. other than that the game is great runs well on a mid price pc, and has fair fight active most of the time. if you get this game just give it time keep playing and chat with people the community is quite nice and they do not mind helping people out! overall if you like a good shooter that is similar to GTA then try it out its wurff! :) 
6254	0	a	i'm ABSOLUTELY not recommend this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, cause: i was on lvl 20 and the game dropped me with much higher lvl players (over lvl. 150) . The players playing like 6 yrs old kids.. : shoots their teammate, can't play in a â¥â¥â¥â¥in' team..  WORTH MMO IN THE WORLD
172	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends. APB is quite a lot of fun with a lot of friends and you just mess around the entire time  -Gameplay. Even though many people find it repititive i still found it quite enjoyable to play and I think have logged something like 200/300 hours into this game.   Cons: -Terrible servers -Terrible developers  - Hackers. Hackers everywhere.
5767	0	a	Dont ever ever play this game it is made only for ppl who pay money,if u just want to get it for free and play it u will get dominated and killed then killed,killed.....
1481	1	a	Really fun game.

3643	1	a	this game is good and bad. pros- -okay gameplay -ultimate customization -feels immersive  cons- -throws curveballs -no story -rough tutorial -unbalanced -skill based
6127	0	a	from the moment you install this game , one thing becomes clear , you can pay to win , you have to pay to win , did i mention that winning is for sale ?  on paper the concept is solid , cops and robbers , sounds fun right ? well its not exactly cops and robbers , the police faction is exactly the same as the criminal faction functionally speaking. you can run over pedestrains as a cop and no one gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥. theres no stake here for fun , the combat is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and P2W , the cars arent fun to drive unless you grind like a korean , thats so will cave in, just say â¥â¥â¥â¥ it and pay them. look just do yourself a favor and stay away from this one, trust me , i know i wish i had.
4003	0	a	-Pay to win -Crappy vehicle controls -Physics suck  -Unclear for new players -Literally nothing to do  TLDR I want a refund and the game's free.
7719	0	a	I actually DO NOT recommend this game. It is terrible. Its glitchy as all hell. The game originally launched with a lot of problems. Not sure what the new development team was doing the year or so they were preparing to launch the game, but the result of their work doesn't make it look like they were working much.
3220	1	a	This game gets me rock hard.
7791	0	a	This game sucks balls. wont update
10363	1	a	awesome game u should try it 
1899	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
942	1	a	I havent played this on steam but i did on the original website and i â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ loved it you can get gangs have fun arrest people if you play this you will get good memories of this game

6412	0	a	best character/car customization simulator ever. you can even make your own themes/songs/symbols too! thats great! i changed my appearances many, many, many times to suit my mood/tastes.  what's bad about it? everything else.  summary: - i played for a good 2 years since its closed beta - many game mechanics changes (some good, some bad) - very good time-waster - the grind is crazy. good news is, you will hardly feel it - learning curve for newbies? HELL. you will think everyone is hacking. yes there were many hackers in its early stages. now? probably just a few. but you will still think holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ everyone is hacking but they're not. they just have superb situational awareness (like you would play a MOBA). fast reaction time, memorized map and routes, and understanding of the game's wonky mechanics. seriously, for real. i know i would accuse people were hacking if i didnt already have thousands of hours clocked on this game. - car handling is wacky. takes some getting used to. - game physics are many lol moments. - fun to play with friends (all experienced clan mates? good. time to faceroll. all newbie friends/pubs? in for major butthurt) - game not p2w. all you can unlock can match payer weapons. (i was high ranked pure F2P) - most important reason not to play this game: the publisher, g1, is a lying, corrupt crook who cheats their playerbase. you won some g1 credits? DENIED. they no give you cuz you exploit their event due to THEIR wonky game mechanics. won anything else? DENIED. last minute event rule changes. wtf? many empty promises. i swear, no lies. - dwindling population + broken matchmaking = enjoy getting banged from behind by the vets. if that's your thing, play this game. otherwise, avoid.  -there is no PvE.  signed, honest confessions of a vet
9982	1	a	Lot of fun.. Nice game.
9992	1	a	Good game, kinda like fallout, i can see myself getting into it.
6400	0	a	played it for 1.3 hours, worst game i've played in a long time. It's pointlessly restrictive and boring, no play.
6893	0	a	This game Is a peach of work.... You start out as bronze but you face gold players the matchmaking sucks...... And its full of hacker's
980	1	a	Really fun game Could improve the fps drops and stuttering 
8894	0	a	OMG This game had the potential to be great, not good but GREAT! As usual they are out for money, but they don't care about their customers. Features are there but due to the bugs are unusable and do not get fixed. The customer service either is incompetant or just unwilling to help with some issues and that makes the game not worth anyone's money let alone time. The crafting is good except for the time to craft gets very bad. Grouping and their maping system is terribly executed and still not fixed. MOBs are everywhere including areas that do not need it but in areas you would expect it, it is empty. it is a game that you can play and reach max level really quick if you want. No real story and some quests are terrible while others are set perfectly without any rhyme or reason. Tradeskills are about 90% to where they need to be but better than most other games out there. Storage is okay but needs more upgradablity.Help channel is okay but don't bother trying to talk to the GMs about anything because they really don't care and would rather help their friends not you.

Limited outfits only for faction armors, weapons and accessories; 90% of the items in the game can be obtained and worn. Huge array of cosmetics items for your toons.  Crafting-based game with about 90% of the items in-game are craftable.  Huge world using real topography of the great Grand Canyon.   Been playing online games since 1999 and by far this is one of the best in the apocalypse category.  Best game ever!
4094	0	a	&lt; Review by a highest rank/skill elite 'Gold' player with a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of hours wasted on it for the only satisfaction of kicking bully kid's butt. &gt;  WARNING: This game will make you want to see the real world burn and almost every human being die screaming in pain.  CONS: - Bad graphic (Screenshots look better than actual in-game graphic, and YEAH, I mean even with everything set on ULTRA)  - â¥â¥â¥â¥ty optimization: Intel i7 + GTX780 Strix 6GB + 24 fu*kin gigs RAM (pc used mainly as a Graphic WORKSTATION just to be clear) and this is the ONLY game so far that still shows stuttering, drops frames for no reason, etc. We are talking about 90-70 fps driving around and suddendly 30-40 fps with a single explosion on screen! The game graphic is from 2011... (for instance Battlefield 4 at ultra runs smooth lag-free at over 60fps costant framerate on my rig)  - Lag, server lag everywhere  - 99.9% of playerbase is made of bully â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dumb4ss kids with 'I-Am-God' syndrome  - Weapons are as realistic as toy water guns. But much less fun.   - Customization is useless and boring, after a while you will just forget about it and just play the same missions again and again  - No need to keep adding to this list, just figure out every possible question about things in this game and answer yourself with a convinced 'IT SUCKS'   PROS: - If you're skilled enough you can eventually kill those dumb4ss kids and enjoy their never-ending whining followed by how much they are stronger than you and hear details about how they will own you, your mother/sister and (i don't know who else cause at that point they're in my ignore list already).
2092	1	a	Interesting. Need to play more.
2811	1	a	Yes, definitely. It's free and it's fun. Cops and robbers, man.
7662	0	a	Aims to be like GTA, but the system doesn't allow for that much freedom, so in order or it to be like GTA, they need to overhaul the whole game, so no, I don't like it.
5139	0	a	This game nearly destroyed my computer! It is so buggy and so unorganized that I could not do anything, play with any of my friends, most of the time I couldnt play it at all. It takes half of your lifetime to get it downloaded and logging in takes up more time than me actually playing this piece of trash. I had to turn my computer off 4 times in 2 hours because it froze my computer or prevented me from playing anything else. I feel like an old person after how much time I've wasted trying to give my effort purpose. How could Steam even consider bringing this horrible mess into their beautiful community of great to way better than APB Reloaded games. Gaben hear my words you awesome god and burn this evil game of devil spawn at the stakes, please.
3676	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
6391	0	a	meh....GTA 5 rip-off, and btw 2005 called, they want their PS2 graphics back
152	1	a	good game- very fun game to play with friends and to meat new ones...
4647	0	a	Nice idea totally broken by a horrible matchmaking, which ends making matches between fresh new players that are learning how to play with endgame players (makes totally no sense). Also, as usual in every 'Free To Play Games' theres a 'Pay To Win Option' that makes you premium and get the good weapons to win all matches easily.  Most weapons AREN'T permanent, they last around 10 days max. The game constantly lag's out, and bugs are frequent. Specially when you're shooting.  The protection against hackers is horrible, as I have seen people using Pistols from long range like if they were using a sniper (reminding that theres not a zoom option, or a very very poor one), I've also seen people using Heavy Rifles with the accuracy of a sniper, which is highly improbable.  Do not recommend, waste your time elsewhere :)    
1258	1	a	Its APB enough said
7884	0	a	This game is a pay to play type of game, when it first came out before I had steam the game was fun. But now its disappointing to say the least. I am sure if you had plenty of spare money to just throw at the game then it would be fun again. Not to mention, that people are rude. Even people who are 'supposed to team with you' they will do whatever it takes just to mess up the game or mission' needless to say... I dislike it. It is free however. Definitely wouldnt waste hard earned cash on it though.
3726	1	a	It's Free, it's Fun, why wouldn't you play it?
8436	0	a	Edit: Basically take all my negative aspects of this review and amplify them and you have an up to date review...  APB: Reloaded is a online 'Cops-and-Robbers' third person shooter game. Gameplay revolves around joining one of two factions, the Criminals or the Enforcers, and then competing in open-world objective-driven missions throughout various districts in the fictional city of San Paro.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of APB is what drives it. It takes an old classic concept (Cops vs. bad guys) and puts a whole new spin on it. Customization of your character is incredibly vast. You can personalize your character's appearance, vehicle, 'theme song,' graffiti logo, and weapon (to an extent.) The physics in the game are a bit exaggerated which often lead to funny, if not frustrating moments. Combat can be fun if you know what you're doing or are playing with people at your skill level.   In that regard, APB does have a match-making system that's good at generally picking out who's a newbie (bronze level) and who's a pro (gold level), but once you get down into it the game just pushes silver players and gold players together which can be frustrating if the game misinterprets whether the player is actually ready to be in that bracket. FINALLY, and this is important. The game does have pretty shameless elements of P2W (Pay 2 Win.) There are weapons that can only be obtained through purchase with actual money and do provide a decent advantage over players who don't pay anything.  Visuals: Graphics hold up decently to more modern titles. While there's certainly no comparison to the next-gen iteration of Grand Theft Auto V, APB took a smart route by utilizing a more cartoon-y look. It's not a photo-copy of reality, but it's not trying to be. That said, it still looks quite good.  Community: This is something that needs to be said about this game. The community is, by-and-large, not the friendliest group of people on the planet. This is partly to be expected from the players of a game where crime, and stopping it by whatever means necessary, is the name of the game. However, I'm not sure I know of a game with more trash-talking and general inconsideration this side of Call of Duty. Asking for help will either get you scoffed at, or given just enough help to get by, and THEN scoffed at. If you want to play with a group of people who aren't ego-maniacs or raging craphats, disable District Chat and invite your friends to play the game with you.  Overall: Don't get me wrong, this game was a big part of my downtime during Spring Break. When trolls and tryhards aren't gunning you down continually with overpowered P2W weapons, this game is a ton of fun. Occasionally you'll find a match that actually accomodates your skill and everyone will be in the same boat as you, and you'll have a blast. Practice and you'll sometimes find yourself top of the scoreboard for a match or two. Just don't take it too seriously, it is afterall just a game. But if you're someone who prone to raging at video games to the point of breaking things, you might need to look elsewhere.
2804	1	a	Good graphics, big community, frequent updates, A HUGE CUSTOMIZATION, and it's free. What else could you ask for(besides for the cars to have better steering)?
8723	0	a	Worthless game with worthless developers. They ban innocent players rather than banning the actual hackers. I'll never recommend anyone to play this game even if it's free. You'll regret it whatsoever.
787	1	a	This game is sooo like gta 5 and the graphics are good and theres all different guns 2 choose :) 
10555	1	a	I went slow once. It was awful.
9505	0	a	It have got a lot of bags. And error in connecting 3/10 Screenshoots are good :3
4412	0	a	Great game, horrible company. Don't trust your wallet and time with these guys, they have banned a lot of good people for doing absolutely nothing. Also, there is only one dev assigned to working on the game, so nothing is getting updated, ever (except for those $50 re-skinned guns that seem to come out every week).
1233	1	a	Is a free game where.. well its basicly cops and robbers around a huge city. You can even free roam, steal cars,buy cars to customize from vendors and you can buy guns and more!really i give this game a 8/10 becuase of 1 second delay when driving.
663	1	a	Many lag, much anger, so mystery, wow!
6704	0	a	It looks like a real good game but the vehicle handling is very poor.   Also, it is hard to learn to play as a newbie. You won't know who's who and will keep running out of bullets. Other players who are a higher level will come in and blast you out of existance, because they have more powerful weapons. Most of the weapons seem to be overpowered, (only been on the wrong end of them of course).  The GPS is next to useless, so unless you know the map, you have a hard time finding your way around.  Other players won't let you play your own game, or won't leave you alone, killing you on sight for no other reason than you are on the side of the law / or the side of the criminals, (as soon as you've ready'd up).   My advice is to make friends with other more experienced players ASAP then you might stand a chance.   I did team up, but the players I teamed up with were also at the mercy of more experienced players. It makes this game a real pain in the â¥â¥â¥ and a waste of time to play.   Very little rewarding gameplay at the start, makes this an awful game to play as a newbie. You will get bored with being killed time and time again!  I spent two hours dying all the time and got so fed-up with the silly car handling that I am giving up on this game for now. 2014-08-17.   Sign-in - Sign up problems. (With GamersFirst). I also played this before when it first came out, I was annoyed that I had to go through the sign up process all over again, and even though I know my email and password, it refused them and I had to start again. When it came to my username, it won't let me have it, claiming it is already in use! (Well, yes it is - BY ME), but it won't let me sign in with the my original username anymore.  Overall:- a waste of time. I do not recommend it!

3354	1	a	i wanted to play this but it was rather glitchy and laggy and i couldnt auctually play it at all and i am sad about that. 
2310	1	a	This game is very great i love it.

3861	0	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's slowly dying..  Don't belive me? Here take a look:  http://steamcharts.com/app/113400   GamersFirst will try to drag as many money out of the players, before they go under..  Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time. Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.  So my Rating: 2/10 GamersFirst have ruined this game...  RIP APB 1987-2016

3678	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10

2917	1	a	Smallest Maps in the History of MMO gaming lol, Still, a funky â¥â¥â¥ game, glad it got brought back. Had a good fan base :)  Game has WAY too much customization, which in turn made the game extremely small in comparison to other MMO's.  If the maps were bigger, And didnt take 30 seconds to get from one end of town to the other, I'd consider giving this another go, But Beta was as far as I went :|  Maybe one day :P When I'm bored â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.

2772	1	a	this is a really good game if you want to play a game like gta 5 but dont have the cash to fork over. 8/10 overall
331	1	a	about the game: The good, the bad and the ugly  The good:  -there is no other game like it -its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free -awezome costumization of character, symbols and cars  The bad:  -HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review) -every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed. -a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)  The ugly:  -toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game) -its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.  Notes:  -it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.  -in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.  -the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.  -because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)  -you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it
4742	0	a	This game is completely dog â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't understand how people find enjoyment out of it.   
838	1	a	the best gamr ever 
8539	0	a	Most broken game i have played!  performance is â¥â¥â¥â¥, uses ages to load anything, have to use 48x AA to fully use the gpu, and you're stuck with 75 fps the pvp is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t as mission makes you face people with rpg's that instakill you or snipers while new players are stuck with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ assault rifles and a pistol with barely any damage.
6699	0	a	I have been playing this game for quite a while now, honestly had a whole bunch of fun when I first started, however the game is too pay to win and has honestly been ruined by people who are actually using cheats on the game. Now when I say 'Cheaters' I'm not talking about people who are actually genuinely good at the game, I am talking about the T rank players that join missions and get about 100 kills and 0 deaths. This honestly makes the game quite boring for others and can get annoying when you're doing the Criminal vs Cops districts.  The game can be the biggest pain in the â¥â¥â¥ when it comes to players too, unless you're willing to throw 10-20 bucks into the game to buy yourself your own vehicle, dont even think about trying to make money with other criminals or cops around as they WILL steal your vehicle and turn the â¥â¥â¥â¥ in for themselves. They can also take things from your car even if they're not in the same group as you. (Unless you own it)  I also honestly never really liked the Market system in this game, you could be really good at designing things but honestly, none of the prices were ever realistic.. people would just put stupid symbols and songs up for $999999999 or even $50000.  APB is a fun game and has some good potential, there is just a few things that need fixing before I'd give it a good rating.
4714	0	a	This is pretty much just a poor man's GTA Online.
8946	0	a	The year is 2156. The Apocalypse has had an Apocalypse. A mutant army is reshaping the world into mutant hell, and only one thing can stop them. From the toxic ashes of Occupy Wallstreet 2 a renegade soldier is born. part man, part hobo. Your character is leading the battle between good and evil, as it has never been faught before. You are on a mission to bring down a battalion of ruthless mutant soldiers, and save the world. ...is what I would like to say. Don't trust the screenshots that allude to gameplay. Herein lies a tragedy. You will spend the majority of your time in expansive untextured areas doing nothing more than shooting mutant dogs with your busted pipe rifle. Avoid, unless that sounds like a good time to you.
5967	0	a	this sucks, i can't even get on 
8782	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
8992	1	a	Do not play this game if : 1.You do not want to invest a lot of time 2.You do not want a crafters-dependent economy. 3.You can not stand exploring for many hours. 4.You are addicted to FPS. 5.''OMFG!! FALLOUT RIPOFF''  You will either like it or hate it.This game is not for the many.In any case give it a try..it is free. After 150 hours I am still playing..and haven't even scratched its surface. 
10367	1	a	this is a great game, if you like rpg and mmo this is for YOU! Of course they will always be the bad comments, but i recommend this game for all of u fans of rpg and mmo!
5925	0	a	Absolutely horrible introduction  Just the fact you dont know â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what youre doing makes this game a no go
753	1	a	I play this game to drive around in a car and listen to my music. Which I can not do in the real world.
9155	1	a	I only played this game briefly, but it was fun. It did, however, have a steep learnin curve, and not much was explained, so it left a beginning player a bit confused and wandering around a bit. I have not played it in many months, however, so patching and the like may have fixed many of those problems. If you like the post apoc or survival genres, it's definitely worth checking out, especially with its (free) pricetag.
10257	0	a	This game needs a lot of work before it can become even close to being good.
10209	0	a	dont play this  its okay but not as worth your time as some other similar games
8269	0	a	It is basically GTA's mentally handicapped cousin.
8228	0	a	Do not play, trying to open the game will literally open a tab in your browser asking for you to like their Facebook page and redeem a code
1578	1	a	it is gta but free very fun with friends
5484	0	a	Bad Graphics You Can't Even Drive A Car Normaly
9984	1	a	It's pretty good both gameplay wise and story wise. It only gets better with friends and even better the farther you get, and as you explore the world of Fallen Earth.
10538	1	a	Don't buy anything from their shop. They abandoned this game.
575	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome game that gives you the chance to play GTA free :D
8292	0	a	This game has good customization, and okay gameplay. it however has one of the worst communitys in gaming history, somewhere between ark and LoL. i tried one mission recently and it was easily greifed by a high level player that kept killing us. why can you even kill your own teammates during a mission vital for leveling up? thats just asking for trolls.  on top of that if you want anythign beyond the starter that isn't clothes, be prepared to dish out real money. and they're not cheap. and they're not permenent. so you pay $20 for a gun that only last 90 days at max, and the time costs extra. the guns you get from ingame currency are only 7 days max, so pretty much worthless.  the fact that a high and max level player can join a level 1 mission is also what ruins the game. imagine trying to win a mission thats supposed to be easy agenst a player with a rocketlauncher that one hits you. thats this game in a nutshell.
9462	1	a	9/10  I actually love this game, although there are frustrating things about it...
6520	0	a	Actually i thought that this game was nice  but in this game the ping is high and playing this game is waste of time Score:3.6/10
1219	1	a	lots of fun
1569	1	a	The game is fairly decent, but I think more can be done to make this game perfect. One of things I believe this game needs is some sort of Campaign or PvE mode. Why you may ask? Well, due to the fact that not everyone is professional at PvP battles. Something like that would defintiely make this FTP game a whole lot more fun. That, and it would probably bring in a lot more players into the game as well.  And with that being said, it's a decent game. Just not perfect...
3192	1	a	Good Game but has very poor matchmaking and slow game development, even still it's probably the best game of cops and robbers you will play and it's totally free.
872	1	a	I spent an entire summer building a character and leveling him; all while enjoying myself and not spending any money, only to find that I have a lifetime/non negotiable ban on my account. So as a sane person I decided my time with APB was done. Fun game, except for that.
5864	0	a	At the beginning it is fun but after a few hours you start to meet alot of people who have payed for better items and are beating you only because they have better stuff.
8221	0	a	IT'S A TRAP
4985	0	a	lot of bugs...
9841	1	a	Like an MMO Fallout game...hard to explain unless you try it yourself. I sorta enjoyed it for the hour or so I played it, so yeah.
3644	1	a	its ok i guess... 
9549	1	a	Never played it but Steam let me write a review.
3614	1	a	I really loved this game, unfortunately my computer wasn't good enough to handle any of it's AWESOMENESS...so I had to uninstall it...*sadface*
5634	0	a	The game would always launch but the game would never actually start up, yet Steam would say it was running.
9362	0	a	its...Ehh not realy worth it its just so...generic and it needs to load up for like 40 min every time you play it so just not worth it sorry.
8094	0	a	Might have been good when it first came out, but nobody plays it anymore so there are verry few servers. Also the controlls are terrible, it's extremely difficult just to drive down the street. Basically just convice yourself to drop $8 on gta sanandreas and you have a better game.
8003	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
9642	0	a	- It takes too much time to master the controls - The quests are boring - The controls are quite complex and should be simplified - Its difficult to navigate to the easier areas of the map - You'll probally never get a horse  - Its fun to play for the first 5 hours
7718	0	a	i hate this
47	1	a	How To Play: 1). Start Game  2). Spend 3-10 hours creating character 3). Try to play but gives error 4). Rate the game 10/10 GOTY IGN GAME JOLT 
8816	0	a	Honestly, this game has gotten pretty good on PC, they are really working to improve the community by banning hackers, and releasing frequent updates on how the game development is going.  However I'm not going to talk about the PC version, I'm going to talk about the Xbone version which seems to be doing terrible as of this moment. I mostly want to talk about false bans but there are other issues I will address here as well.  First the game was super laggy and broken when released, which is to be expected. However it still frequently crashes and lags up pretty hard despite the 'fixes' they have released.  The community is â¥â¥â¥â¥, but that comes with territory.  So I personally don't play the xbone version, I'm pretty loaded on PC and I'd rather not start over. My girlfriend however, plays the game almost religously. The clan she is in is pretty huge in the community, and is well known for elite players who have way too much time on their hands. Recently however a rival clan started PAYING people (he admitted to it, the owner has a recording of it) to mass report members of the clan my girlfriend is in. Pretty much half the clan has gotten false bans at this point, and G1's only response is 'we don't issue false bans' even after posting said proof of false mass reports, they just ignored it. The man in question paying his clannies to false report, is sitting back, laughing, and bragging in social about how he's gotten an entire clan banned, and G1 STILL refuses to do anything about it.  This is beyond pathetic, some of these players have already put quite a bit of money into the game. So why would it bennefit them to mod their xbone, and hack in APB? Also why haven't they been console locked for modding console and 'detected' hacks yet?   Exactly, because there was no wrong-doings on the part of said clan, except they were rivals with another huge clan that just wanted them out of the picture, and G1 doesn't give a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what goes on in the community, only what they feel is right and wrong will be addressed.  SOOOOO, until they decide to start giving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the xbone, which a lot of players have now moved to, or started playing. I'm not putting another â¥â¥â¥â¥ing penny into this game.
7938	0	a	very bad =C
4700	0	a	Anyone who pays is on top.
2114	1	a	I actually do recommend this. I really liked the online gameplay, graphics, weapons, and especially the cars. I had a lot stuff put into this game but I actually lost everything about 2 years back. I uninstalled this game because I kept getting an error on startup. So, I don't even remember my account anymore lol. But, I do remember the fun times I had in this game. Pretty fun! :)
10198	0	a	Have tried to start the game several times. In the beginning, it would not even let me log in with my Steam ID. Later on, and also now, it starts updating something and quickly gets into an infinite loop trying to update and check data. Still have yet to experience any of this game... (Uninstall works, at least I hope so...)
10303	1	a	This game has really great atmosphere. That is because most of the content is ripped straight from the Wasteland/Fallout universe. If you ever wanted to play a Fallout-ish MMO, this is the best choice. It's more focused on crafting and the whole 'carrot on the stick' gameplay, and of course you can just buy the carrot. I really enjoyed the short time I spent in game.  I'm torn about this game because, quite frankly, the community is just awful. Instead of Zone chat like in most mmo's, there's a Help chat. It's filled with players that have been there for a while, but most of them have that whole 'elite' attitude. Help chat is supposed to be used for people with questions, thus the name. These 'Elitists' will use Help chat for anything they want, berate and accuse new players of trolling, then turn around and lecture everyone on the 'proper way' to use Help chat. The GM's are even worse. They constantly hand out mutes/bans, but ignore any complaints towards the preffered players that have been there for a long time or spent probably $500 in the cash shop.   Also, the GM's are crazy about censoring peoples' screen names. I had a name that wasn't even offensive, I played for a bit and when I came back, my name was Cupcake1244. Yes, if they deem your name offensive, you get to roam the Wastelands as Cupcake____. And you only get 1 character slot as a F2P player. I contacted a GM about changing my name and guess what? Oh, you can BUY a name change in the cash shop. $10 because you got offended for no reason? Hah!  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that's going to argue right back with you when you're acting douchey. So I told everyone off in Help chat and am uninstalling :)   To sum it up, if you enjoy the crafting side of mmo's with a Fallout/Wasteland atmosphere, go for it. But if you're not going to spend money on it, I'd suggest that you keep the chat window closed and just chat with people locally. You're going to want to avoid these Basement-Dwellers.
10276	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;)

8607	0	a	This game sucks horsecock, DO NOT INSTALL THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥! even tho you aint doing mission and still are on tutorial u can get killed and has to waste another 3 hours on thes hitty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. I promise you that will will uninstall this asap. I got 1 day premium and it â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the game and my pc with 8gb ram ran this game smooth 3 hrs ago but after 3 hrs playhing this game it turned into complete â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5169	0	a	This is a bunch of P2W trash.  Pros : The concept. Wide variety of guns, Clothing, And accessories. Able to make your own gopnik, blin. Who doesn't want that?  Cons : Everything else.  All in all, This game is a piece of trash, That I had very high expectations for, From what one of my friends told me. Big mistake, My friend. Big mistake.
4360	0	a	After two days, I have found the community is small and very rude to new players. More of that venomous pvp game mentality and you'll find yourself outgunned almost instantly. If you aren't playing this with friends, don't play it. You simply aren't a match for the team-ups that will come at you. Matchmaking is terrible and you'll always end up fighting someone with hundreds more hours than you.   If you're an old player and you get it, great, have at it. If you didn't play this for a year or years ago, don't start now.  Also, the cash shop is one of the more predatory, taking your weapons away every 10 days and making you re-buy them...unless you want to pay for the gun with about 30+ real dollars....or a car for that much. The prices on items are astronomical.
5834	0	a	Bad controlls, physics are terrible, pace is sloooowwwwww and the game is a 'PAY TO WIN' game. I knew there would be a reason why it was free so I dont know what I was thinking....
3418	1	a	Very Good Game. Kindam pay to win, but still you ca have lots of fun when you are skilled to use the starter weapon.a
4723	0	a	garbage cant get passed terms and conditions
9510	1	a	I live my life by a moral code. I give games a chance to prove themselfs, but this game has broken my will to live. It looks like a child stuck in the 90s has mad this and is amazed by its visual aspects. The cancer in my eyes will forever burn. Thank you for this life lesson. I suggest everyone tries this game but have a friend presant so as to stop you from self harming.
5702	0	a	The game is always running and I can't even close â¥â¥â¥â¥ing close it!
7000	0	a	this game does not run its a ripoff

5264	0	a	Other than the crazy detailed charecter creation, this game doesnt have much. It feels like a generic third person shooter, with generic guns and generic cars. Also it is a sandbox but theres no real free roam just group missions making the game pretty boring.
2314	1	a	Good game not as good as a GTA but i still give it a thumbs up but the only problem is the 30 mins it takes to load it.
228	1	a	u â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s better play this cus its dope hell â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ weed watermelon whitewomen friedchicken!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3134	1	a	Awsome game!
1883	1	a	Love this game. It's a nice twist on cops and robbers. The addition to being able to arrest criminals is awesome IMHO. If you're looking for a good Cops vs Robers kidna game this is it.   The only con I have with this game is that at times it will freeze and force you to restart your computer unless you disable all but one audio device.
8513	0	a	One of the worst games ive ever played
7338	0	a	the only game i uninstalled within 1 day
5641	0	a	This game needs more requirements then it says it's all lies
443	1	a	seems like a good game, although I haven't played enough to say. would recommend. 
2508	1	a	it is awesome i mean you can be a cop or a bad guy you would never stop playing it because it has guns on each freaking side lke hloy hell. thank you for reading my review :D
3871	0	a	Like what Grand Theft Auto is, but boring. It does allow you to make your own music, so you'll have a thousand internet dorks having the game play Still Alive in your ears when they kill you.
35	1	a	This is the best worst game I've ever played. The highs are very high, and the lows are very frequent. This game is like heroin. Once you've played it for a while, it's very hard to quit.   Despire what some people are saying cheating isn't as common as they say. Having spent 3000-3500 hours playing this game, I can say that from experience. There have been more than a few closets and quite a few blatants, that's true. But it's not nearly as bad as it seems. Most of the 'cheaters' are people who've spent 1000+ hours and are in 3rd party VOIP (IE Mumble, TS, or Vent) communcating. I've been hackusated many times for things like that. As an experienced player you gain a sense of what your opponent is going to do, and if you react to what your instincs tell you, half the time you'll get a hackusation. The game also has more than a few bugs. Sometimes you'll literally see players names through a wall for no apparent reason, Or a wall will simply not load immediately letting you see through it.   While I'm not sure if I could recommend it to friends anymore, I definitely enjoy the game. The few friends I've tried to get into it have played about 20 missions and then quit because they ended up against premade teams that absolutely wreck them, over and over and over and over again.
1588	1	a	GREAT NOT PAY TO WIN YOU CAN BUY GREAT GUNZ INGAME 100% worth brathaz TRUST ME WHEN I FIRST PLAYED THIS I SAID OH â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS PAY TO WIN â¥â¥â¥â¥ BUT I GOT IN TO IT I HAVE EVERY THING AND NEVER PUT ANY REAL MONEY IN TO THIS GAME 
9939	1	a	This game offers lots to do for mmo gamers at every level. The maps are large and look the part. Enemies vary to keep things interesting and generally fit in their environment on the map. Crafting is a HUGE part of this game and can be time consuming but it is done in a way that players can queue up tasks for offline time. Character can be built with skills chosen by the player and customized to fit playstyle. Quests are available in the game but are optional.  Personally the crafting element of the game is my favorite. It brings together the need to scavenge and find the parts you need to craft to advane further into the game.  If you enjoy a sandbox mmo that doesn't marshal you through it's world from start to finish and you enjoy the genre, I would recommend trying this game.  (This review is based off playtime from before the game was offered on Steam, I just recently switched to the Steam version)
771	1	a	So, If you like getting frustrated or yelling at your computer who did nothing to you..this is ya game, dawg  There's a love-hate relationship with this game so if you..y'know what, I'm going to go get some taco bell. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this.
5839	0	a	its piece of crap on a stick
5601	0	a	Such an odd game... But almost like a sh*tty saints row
3285	1	a	Ebola Game :) been playing it for about 3 to 4 years...
2297	1	a	Big Guns, Large Scale Shootouts, Fast Cars, and Total Anarchy?   F*CK YEAH!!! This is a great game for the ones who like guns, Cars, And (Gang?) Warfare.   On my pc (i5), the game lacks a miniscule amount of frames.   It takes a it to run, but overall,    IT'S A DAMN GREAT GAME!     - 419NigerianPrinceEA  (Please don't send me your EA username &amp; Password It's just a joke)
6129	0	a	Unrealistic game. Don't even try it.
7271	0	a	Garbage, stay clear. 2/10 Great character creation and customization, nothing else worth mention.
8836	0	a	p2w, one of the worst communities ever. would not recommend.
1983	1	a	I thought it was fun. Not sure why so many negative reviews
7745	0	a	the game just goes off my screen but it says that i am still playing it even though i cany see it.
5355	0	a	Nope.THis game looks good but its not its only and only pay to win!
5821	0	a	This game is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  Took two hours to install, with another installation not mentioned in the description... And then it denied my video card. I'm so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off with this game. I used to have this game on another PC, but when I reinstalled it on here I can't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing believe what I saw. Uninstall while you still can.
7722	0	a	Here's my recommendation: that you AVOID this game, and REFUSE to pay any money towards the publishers: G1. The customization is great (well, what was left to GamersFirst by the original creators: Realtime Worlds, RIP), and the driving is funny in a Gmod-physics kind of way, but the combat is utterly deploreable. Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin. Marx isn't turning in his grave, he's weeping and saying 'I told you so!'
3962	0	a	A prime example of a great concept that is run into the ground by profiteering â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  The Pay-to-win aspect besides, the gameplay is extremely repetitve and is basicly a deathmatch third-person shooter with cops vs robbers theme. The only redeeming aspect about this game is it's customization, which is yet to be matched by any other game. Just pretend you're playing Playstation Home and you're all good to enjoy this game.

3145	1	a	Love the game! Just wished fairfight would do more work :D 
7697	0	a	Pay to win.... simple
3607	1	a	
850	1	a	Its a fun game to play with your friends or just solo.  But if you wanna get good...  be ready to get your mom's credit card.  
9014	1	a	I haven't played this game for ages, i've re - read the description to remind myself of what had happened, it's basically Fallout or DayZ. Imagine the way you do things. A massive roleplaying game awaits.
4709	0	a	An okay game, I wouldnt recommend though. Alot of the servers are laggy, the community isnt the best, and quite frankly its really a pay to win kinda game. there are alot of other free to play games out there, and quite frankly id rather pay money for GTA or gmod (gamemodes) to play something like this.
859	1	a	I have never spent a dime on this game and had an amazing time. I haven't played it via steam, but I love all the 2k+ hr guys saying it is not good. It is kind of like a simple version of GTA with awesome customization and PvP. Even just driving around the city is fun. Don't spend any money if you don't like it, you don't have to in order to play.
9825	0	a	Guns are underpowered nuff said. When I shoot someone in the head I expect them to die.
6919	0	a	Hacks and hacks and aimbots and punk buster hacks and more hacking and people who jump while aiming in air and kill you hacks all day everyday if you want to waste money on market place and get hacked with new best gear play APB reloaded and get hacked all day.
3349	1	a	Massive customization options overall, even if you don't have the prem account, you stil can do a lot of fun making your own character if you have imagination, of course. Good shoot arenas, pace gameplay, tons of fun shooting others up. Not perfect, but it's free and really playable .. reccomend this for a choise over buying a GTA series, still not so good as those, but surelly worth a try..
1810	1	a	Pretty fun game, slightly repetitive, very microtransaction-based... But still pretty good quality for a FTP game.
10616	1	a	One of the best fps games ever made. Support is lacking and the player base is small but it's still one of the best fps ever made.
3219	1	a	Makes me wanna flip off myself for installing it
6603	0	a	when I played APB before it became 'Reloaded': the shooting controls felt sloppy yet unforgiving; gunfights took place in poorly-designed spaces that were extremely difficult to traverse; the world felt empty most times and nonsensical at others. caveat emptor.
4959	0	a	A lot of people say this is a pay to win game.. It's not.. It's a pay to be slightly better than you were before but still getting destroyed...  1 SMG=27$? That's ridicoulous...  This game is UN-COMPLETABLE if you don't spend money.. Like.. a LOT of money...
7703	0	a	they NEED to â¥â¥â¥â¥in make this compatible with windows 8!!!!!!!!!!!     
8564	0	a	Sadly I got banned from this game but I would recommend for customizations but not recommend due to the in balance in game play when people buy from the micro transaction
6576	0	a	If you like repetitive gameplay or GTA-style PvP this is the game for you otherwise, run for your life!  It's fun Co-Op game to play with friends other than that it's pretty bad. 
4244	0	a	Well, as you can see i have played this for nearly 24 hours. Yet, i have no idea what is this game about, what is the objective of this game.
7680	0	a	I do not recommend this game. If you are beggner go do some misions some pro player will snipe you or kill u with rpg on sight. Best game i have ever uninstalled
7259	0	a	not worth playing in this current state.
5374	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ Gta Online with a touch more Pay to Win.
10691	1	a	I was a huge Tribes II fan and this game works for me! Long live Tribes! Few things in the world of gaming can be compared to the rush you get from making a really difficult shot. The game is easy and fun to get into, but the possibility of improving your skill seems to go on forever. I am very pleased that this game is being supported again and is now on steam.
7032	0	a	this is a good game  but have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad engine
370	1	a	it is a little bit underated the game is fun if following like to make music, playing the game or make kickass art

8234	0	a	I spent 30 minutes downloading the launcher, and 20 minutes downloading the game. Then, another 5 for DirectX. I click start, and a page pops up on Chrome, and the game isn't there.  10/10 would waste time again.  EDIT: I finally got the game up, and it wants me to make an account. Why? Why should I? I don't see why people make you sign up for a game you downloaded through Steam.
1369	1	a	better than GTA online 6/10.

2000	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
7549	0	a	Ive downloaded this on my laptop, 2 of my other desktops. Specs are beyond what is needed and it is up to date. The game doesnt run...
8880	1	a	Best post apocalyptic mmo I have ever played, but then again there are not many out there. I will admit as of this recommendation I am not that far in-game, but from what I have seen, it's definitely a keeper! You have got to try fallen earth.
5499	0	a	i will install this game back if the company stops focusing on the money and starts focusing on feedback  2/10  (i dont have 16.4 hrs on apb btw)

3773	0	a	As a high lvl Veterean (Rank 213), who played before it became APB Reloaded. I have had good and bad expereinces that you others players should know before you decide to try this shi tt yy game. I'm a vet who plays only with a few friends and we do not belong to any of those hacking â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ d i ck clans. Will, lets get to the point. My friends and me aren't your typical COD players, We actually use common sense, strategy, map awareness, gaming headsets for max sound of invironments (footsteps, cars...), steam or skype chat for fast comm, and along with our legal macros from our gaming mouse and keyboards. Will we pretty much dominated when we can most of the time, but when we versus other high lvl players and major clans and beat them in missions. They become crybabies and accuse us of hacking. Then their also friends with the ((( GM/DEV ))) so getting your legit account banned is %100 possible. I spent over $100 on this game and now its nothing because of the currupt game system and player hating h o e s.   Pros -  -great game concept that I have ever experienced -Great costumization -great fire fights in 3rd person -great realtime strategy game to play with friends/family  Cons -  -broken spawn points -unbalanced team match up (2 above avrg. stat. gold players can be matched against 3 golds or lower rank players becoming a 2 vs 3-5) one sided missions -can't even get a match going nowadays unless you wait 5min plus  -currupt DEV / GM who plays with high lvl players, and they troll or are d i c k s to other players  -Most high lvl players rank 190 and up are hackers and if not, they hack their way up with immunity from the currupt DEV/GM to get there  -if you are a decent or good player who expresses great game abilities like shooting, knowing your surroundings, common sense, and more. You will automatically be qualified as a hacker to be banned. Evidence is (heresay most of the time with rarely the anti cheat picking you up)  -BAD GAMING Community  By now you should figure that I was banned for no reason other than jealousy so I stop playing. RIP (2011-2013)   I also went back to try it out late 2014, and became a gold at rank 17. I was already accuse of hacking by my opposition. We still lost a mission due to spawn point/ one sided missions. Then my own team mate whisper to me and was cursing at me, because we lost and he thought that I was hacking so there should be no reason for us to lose.   If you want, go for it and try this game out. I told you so...
8528	0	a	WTF IS THIS GAME ITS PAY TO WIN HARD TO SHOOT HARD TO DRIVE LIKE OMG THIS GAMWE IS SDHITTY I SUGGEST YOU DONT EVEN MOVE YOUR MOUSE NEAR THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOWNLOAD BUTTON IF YOU CLICK IT IT WILL DOWNLOAD A CANCER GAME 
5797	0	a	I dont feel like this game should be on steam free2play list, it should be on pay2win. So the only thing good is the Character customization, I spent 1 hour because there are too many selections. The bad thing is the optimization and the players....they hack eyy.  Im giving this a 6/10 :(
2526	1	a	Not bad, but it still needs some improvment.The cars handling is not that good, it's like they are on ice.And then when you begin then all the 'pros' kill you beacuse they have better weapons than the beginners.   I would give it a 5/10
1256	1	a	i dont even know how to start up the game LOL!
8896	1	a	Really fun for a while. Environments are beautiful and the people are generally nice.  The Role-playing Community is one of the best I've encountered however, most have left (with myself) due to the fact it gets very repetitive and boring after a few hundred hours.  Good time killer.
140	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game, but is extremely hard at the begining. It take quite some time to get used to game mechanics, teamplay, map and so on but once you are done with it, you will never stop playing. The game has huge potencial, limitless customizaton and tons of content. Thou some of it is buyable with real money only. But fortunatly the game is SKILL BASED. What means good teamplay or good skills can beat any gun, and you have plenty of good option to utilize your gameplay as you please.
2410	1	a	ITS SWEET BETTER THEN ALL THE GTAs.
2640	1	a	Its only good to hack in, dont waste your G1C because they will ban you for no reason anyways. infact dont waste your time and internet downloading this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8567	0	a	If this game wasnt P2W it would be so unbelievable GREAT. The coustomisation is unlike any other game. The idea is really something else aswell as captivating and competitive. If you only had to use real money to look cool or have a cool car it would be amasing. But this game is too unbalanced by the obtainable weapons with microtransactions that its hard to actually engoy it.
7978	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
7684	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
10765	1	a	Think of Battlefield on every Drug you can think of. With a Cheaper price tag.

6133	0	a	This game sucks. I can only describe it as being the largest waste of time that you can ever experience in a concentrated amount of time. That being said, I had a lot of fun playing it. And I don't know why.
10620	1	a	Great game! Too bad the devs have decided not to support it. I fugure if I buy the game, the people who made it owe me a little consideration for the purchase.
10767	1	a	One of the few true good games in recent years. Skill based, as all great games are, and a lot of fun.
8454	0	a	this game went â¥â¥â¥â¥, seriously.. the community sucks so hard, it could easily suck you through a garden hose. besides that, the publishers tend to scam us by any means necessary. i'm not even gonna talk about the massively increasing amount of cheaters wandering about, ruining your day.
280	1	a	APB Reloaded IS A GRAET GAME
7848	0	a	it is a Pay To Win game
8661	0	a	UPDATE--9_7_2016 If you guys know by now the game now simply a PayToWin! I sorry G1, after i see what marketplace sale with useless and dumb equipment and other stuff, i have no choice to set this not recommend. You guys(G1) said going to update the engine, but for me, i suggestion move on! Meaning make new game,new APB, advance than GTA5 and MGS5, combine 2 into 1...  I hope one day someone made that happen!  --This is the preview review below when the game was great before, feel free to read what i felt if you willing to!--  For those who wanna step up into hardcore battle similar like COD and GTA stlye, here want you looking for!  Honestly i have few word of reason that recommend and not recommend for you guyz..So here me out then! Why i'm recommend?  This game have customize character, art design for clothing and cars and make cool music that the game provide the tool they have~  It was amazing how you can choose you own way depending what you like it.Well you can't make any art design and music of your own, why not buy other creativity stuff then. The gameplay was awesome just like gta but it most liking of COD battle stlye when health can regen itself if you take cover! And now, why i do not recommend?  1st, the game is hard.Few players that you will might encounter was a pro or averge that think themself they are the best but not and among of them might mock you or takedown many times when you about to learn how the game work.After that you might give up by the stress from them and play other game~  2nd, Some newbies give up this game easy,right?...Well some newbie might not giveup but will break the rule of the game.Yup! that right, other you will encounter is cheater and hacker that might ruining the game and your's fun times.  Lastly, well everyone already know that some server you enter is lagging. No matter where you choose, it will still lag.  Lagging might come if your internet slow, sometime is your grapfic card or memory ram not enough for the game to run it. But this year lagging alway be there wheather your pc low or high that another topic that ruining the game else well...but hopefully, next year i think, G1 try to fix the problem of lagging so hope is work.But if the next year didnt fix the problem, well it up to you guy to decide then.     Overall, the gameplay, customize character, design stuff is really awesome for me but sadly there might few downfall to it, so it 8.5 out the 10 for me.  The game very old now, so if the Game Creator planning to make 2nd installment with improvement gameplay most similar like Metal Gear Solid 5, i definintly want help out the character design then~ :D
9221	1	a	Fallen Earth its my best MMO RPG-ACTION-ADVANTURE-PVP-PVE-RAID-CLAM-FIGHT-SURVIVAL-OPEN WORLD-CRAFTING-ZOMBIE-CO-OP-FPS/TPS and of curse ![Post-Apocalyptic]!  so im really RECOMMEND this game for all who love MMoRPGs Games  and thnx  leave like yo!
2814	1	a	This game is decent if you are willing to look past the bugs and rage inducing Pay 2 win weapons. I do suggest that you play with a group of friends and use VoIP, seeing as how its damn near impossible to win any missions without communication. This game is also pretty poorly optimized, loading the freckles of the pedestrians faces before loading the wall that you are about to unwittlingy drive into, so I urge you to only play this if you have a damn good machine and no anger problems.
9320	1	a	I say this game is like a mixture between Fallout and Star Wars the Old republic. It looks great, definitely download it. Watch some gameplay vids 1st, it is a bit complicated if you are just starting it.
5896	0	a	bad game, pay to win and doesnt run well.
8917	1	a	I like this game, but it has many problems people won't simply dismiss. I for one can forgive them but it confuses why these problems exist. Problems like animation, hitboxes, crafting system. They all seem outdated and worse versions of what other games do. The first person animations are monstrous, but the third person animations are alright. The hitboxes can be a bit wierd but bearable. The crafting system is a click, wait, get kind of system, where you get the materials, hit craft, wait a while (5 min to 10 hours depending on the item.) then you go and get it from the menu. Also something that bugged me was that this game came out in 2009 originally and that they had the nerve to put a price on this game before it went free to play. This game is a good free to play but paying for it is a horrible and idiotic idea, simply because the polish in this game is next to nothing. This game does get in depth later on though with factions, vehicle (Better vehicles I should say, since you get a horse ealy on.), and more advanced and better looking weaponry. The quests are interesting and sometimes challenging but luckily I had friends to help me out, this also improved the amount of fun that I had with this game. When you first get in it may look like another hotbar World of Warcraft like game (I actually like WoW it's just that many MMO's borrow so much from it that it gets boring.) but all those keys are 100% option for a more 'magic' oriented player. The tutorial is horrible, boring, and useless aside from simply teaching new players and should be skipped if you have played before. Now onto the better parts of this game. It progression is slow but it feels good to finally get that first revolver after using pellet guns for a while. The custimization in this game is good ingame but in character creation it is limited but acceptable. The towns feel alive due to all the other players going around doing their missions, crafting, learning, etc. Now for a more personal opinion, I found this game alright, it gave me fun times with my friends but sometimes I would get locked getting resources in an area for crafting and trading. I saw myself just joking around a lot before heading out to do a mission, which my friends would have fights over because some would go ahead of each other and it honestly annoyed me. This game also has PvP which I never participated in since I had no real reason to. This game gave me some rewarding progression (Which was created from the effort and time put in), confussion as to why it isn't more polished and improved, and a annoying but sometimes fun time with my friends. If I would have to give this a score it would honestly be a 5/10. I see the appeal here it's just I can't get over why it is like it is now: a messy MMO shooter with mechanics which could be improved easily. I recommend this game to someone who takes MMO's as serious as a mature Arma player.
3811	0	a	No, just no With Friends maybe yes but alone NO itâs not safe outside anymore! The new Slogan for this game might as well be   'Its just a prank bro!' 'why so serious' 'noob noob noob'   I was also hunted down for having an Iron cross. The SJW Furry-sect clearly hate everything German!  That is the community. Equal to a fake prank Social Justice Fury Vegan Gains Feminist Hilary Supporters Religious Warriors ISIS Onision channel!!! There is NOTHING WORSE than those combined.  Iâm DONE WITH THIS GAME!!!!!!!  p.s I donât have a thing with furies no. I just put you there because Keck.  Also Vegans, yea its the behaviour that makes you unpopular.  As for the rest Steam salty everywhere brah
8443	0	a	When this game was first released in stores and offered all content available to it's users, I heard nothing but great things about the game. Only downside was a smaller playerbase since many people simply have backed away from monthly payments for MMOs in the modern age of F2P (Free 2 Pay) games.  So eventually the game went F2P and moved onto Steam where I myself started playing it. Now it had a few bumpy issues such as having %30-%50 of the customization content blocked behind paywalls. But this was to be expected of a F2P game anyways.  Then the game slowly started changing...getting...corrupted...everything started costing money...the fun started to disappear as content was getting added slower...and slower...until the game was no longer the fun and customizable world that it promised to it's players. Now it is but a shell of itself, whispering...'pay me...paaaaay...meeee' in your ear at every opportunity.  10/10 wouldn't play again...
5488	0	a	If you like getting camped by rocket launchers straight out of spawn. This is the game for you.
4926	0	a	Pay to win.
884	1	a	Don't Know What To Write . Just Give It A Like
6616	0	a	10/10 Lawson is a lier
9887	1	a	really good
9092	1	a	Great game, Nearly everything i wanted out of a multiplayer Fallout-all its missing the loot what the enemy is wearing and leave thier naked bodies on the side of the road.
6407	0	a	I have 2,000 hours on this game, I played it without Steam until 6 months ago.  This game is 'okay', but seriously, don't play it. I can't stop playing it, but for those interested, stay away.
694	1	a	This is a great game if you can with stand the trashy community. Overall, there's quite a bit of things that need fixing, and are currently in the process of being fixed.   It has countless amounts of replay-ability and can easily be considered one of the most addicting games i've played.   Customizability is great, however they continue to offer a premium service (Which is kinda needed.)   The market place system makes it seem as though the game is pay to win, but overall it's not. You need to put a lot of time into this game to have an enjoyable experience. And by enjoyable i do not mean crashing cars into other cars until they explode.  If i were to give this game a rating out of ten, at least an 8/10.  It's worth the try and if you can't seem to get into it, well, find something else thats up your alley.
1120	1	a	  The game is a lot of fun. Yes the objectives are pretty much repeatable, but every time you play the same objective its different expirience, because of the people you play with and against are different. The only thing i hate about this game is the loading time, but it still worth waiting.
5631	0	a	An extremely budget free-to-play open world game, immitating Grand Theft Auto across all areas of gameplay and experience. It is also multiplayer only.
7405	0	a	i want free â¥â¥â¥â¥ing G1C NOW!
4474	0	a	Pay 2 win, everwhere.
9989	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS...I CANNOT LOG IN!!  THEN IM SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS
9001	1	a	This game is amazing. I headed into it completely blind, and i was astounded as to the sheer enormity of it. Every session i play i find a new item or enemy. The game world is so big I havent been out of the first sector yet and im still surprised to the hugeness of it. Plus you get all of this for free.  I love the skill advancement, its non-linear and your are free to spec into anything you want. There are no classes to restrict you, telling you how to play the game. The only classes are the ones you make yourself.
3195	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA
10427	1	a	This game is very good and I played it alot with my brother. the only bad thing is getting a vehicle is hard and the people in chat are not helpful at all. over all I would give this game an 8/10. pretty good game. Check It Out!
7356	0	a	I dont like it i cant get it to work after i download it so i guess i'll just get back to playing star trek online or find another open world free to play game thanks but no thanks
5636	0	a	This f*cking game, it almost gave me an aneurism. It is so terrible, as my friend Jack mentioned you either fork out $30 for a gun that isn't very good, or grind for weeks for a sh*tty cosmetic item such as shoes. The optimization is awful, the community is a bunch of 12 year olds, cars handle like there's no gravity, and the interface doesen't even work and/or is confusing as sh*t. Hackers everywhere and glitchers constantly killing you. Even with the poor anticheat if there even is one. This game is truly, one of the absolute WORST programs I have ever had on my hard drive. And who the hell sells a $100 DLC that has very little to offer??? Dafuq?  1/10.
1570	1	a	its good or something
7845	0	a	This game is a brilliant idea but out of my short play time i found this game laggy and annoying all I wanted to do was free roam online then kill other players, when i was playing I was shooting a guy that was online did'nt hurt him what so ever then he shot me and i died its really annoying. So i recomend that if you have a really good computer play this game if not get another.
5184	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game, ever. First of all, the self-claimed free-to-play is worth a big laugh in the face. There will be rental guns, but all of them are too (in-game) expensive. You will have to play like an addict to finally get one sucky ducky gun off the shelf, while those rentals are only around 7 days. Some are 3. You may want to ask if there is any permanent weapon. The answer is yes, but it comes with a price. Big price. The ARMA Marketplace, where people spend real money to get stuff, is a black market. Do you want to spend around 20 bucks for a single permanent but virtual item? If you do, then this game is totally for you. However, getting only one SMG is not enough to survive the gangster world of APB. There are high-tier players who have apparently cashed out on the game, and they'll do anything to put you off with your newly bought SMG. Then, you'll want to spend more money on another weapon. Unfortunately, this is an endless circle. As you buy something, the game will trick you into buying another. Hold on to your wallet, folks. The second problem I have is the gameplay itself. It's not balanced at all. While the bad guys would rob a store any time they want, the cops would have to chase them down if they ever want to get paid. Chasing criminals is the only way cops can make money in the game. I wasn't so surprised to find out that cops were totally outnumbered. The third ugly issue with the game is the players. I'm not saying that these bad eggs are misbehaving kids, but really all they do are bragging about themselves, trolling other players, and generally being rude. Cops are not exceptions. Almost every pro players (a.k.a. money spenders) I see are most of the time intolerable. Oh, not to mention aiming hack, which is the main contributor to fooling you into buying a new weapon. Tips: no weapons nor human skills can beat auto-aim. The only good thing about the game is its customization ability, but barely enough to compensate for the game's cons. All in all, God forbid you play this game.
1008	1	a	This game is incredibly frustrating. But play it, because at the same time, It's one of the best F2P Shooters I've found.
1465	1	a	Fun game with my friends .
5053	0	a	It sucks
10761	1	a	A modern take on the ultimate high speed, high skill, far future team-based online multiplayer FPS epic that was Starsiege: Tribes. It's most equivalent to Tribes base. Skiing is there. CTF is the same mechanically. A few gripes: The advent of more conventional ballistic weaponry, not enough maps and variations in the maps that are available.   Raindance is the only legacy map. They should add more. (Stonehenge has long since been added)
5290	0	a	Pay to win, laggy. Snipershot 1m from head doesn't kill.  Premium pistol at 100m 1shot kill.
3425	1	a	After a few hours it will be boring
5472	0	a	DO NOT get this game. It is terrible!! The driving is off, the shooting is off, and the controls are terrible! It is no wonder the company that made this went under!
3082	1	a	For some reson i love this game. the first time i played i didnt like the game that mach but i really recomend it to people that love being cool and are really good with art (on computers of cors) and for people that don't like killing but making money of the marcketplays thats it
5284	0	a	Played this game from back in the Beta days years ago up to now, with a year break just recently.  And after all that Dev time (and $$$) and hours of people playing/complaining - not much of the terrible one sided mission/extremely broken mechanics have been updated/balanced. However the ARMAS market place has had MASSIVE upgrades, and a whole host of overwhelming 'Pay to Win' weapons/skins/stupidity have been added - goes to show where this studios heart lies. No new updates to reduce day 0 complexity for new gamers, no improvment in game modes/group sizes.  It's no surprise that player numbers have decreased a lot since I played last. My only comments are really for the Gamers first platform - DO SOME REAL DATA ANALYTICS. People don't want a few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car mods and pointless skins to convert from a free to premium player -- They want a real reason to grind that all important level, unlock that great weapon, make something else available. Account wide pay to win weapons? Fine! no problem, but at minute 1? The freemium model you use might be great for short term conversion - but it will kill your playerbase ---- I told you so.  TL;DR This game has amazing potential in terms of its concept and execution, it's only a matter of time before someone else does it better. Play it and enjoy if you are bored - but don't invest heavily - you will infinitely regret it.
4566	0	a	Gosh, this game is completely f*cked up! Matchmaking is utterly bulls*it. From the very beginning you need to play with highlevel characters and donaters. Donate, f*ck, it's terrible. It's not just 'pay to buy something faster than the others' it's completely 10000% Pay2Kicka*s. Customization in this game is just wonderful. It is the one reason why you should play this game, else DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
8098	0	a	dont waste your time here.
10204	1	a	do not play it it sucks 
10079	1	a	Fallen Earth was OK.Not one of the best games I played,but not terrible.There are many errors to it,and in the beggining the gameplay is a little dull,but overall its a decent game mostly for fans of fallout 3.
6053	0	a	my poops look better than this game...
8573	0	a	It takes years to load up the game fix it please!
5086	0	a	1. click 'play'  2. wait to download files 3. click 'start'  4. game crash 20 times 5. delete the game
5923	0	a	This game is confusing, no really, I don't understand anything
7129	0	a	Game was awesome, too bad it WAS... That was one of the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played, too bad this game is stucked at beta and its release date - 2011y... I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money... I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING A SINGLE BUCK ON THIS CRAP, SO DEVS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOING TO LOSE ALL THE PLAYERS, AND I PERSONALLY HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN 1 DAY! Sorry if my review contain mistakes, nobody is perfect, but the game IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. -8/10
6989	0	a	this game is straight up meth. hooks you in to the game. yet the game itself isn't good in anyway.   if your enemy has a better gun, your dead. how to win fights with equals, jump,crouch, act like a madman with a gun.  oh you want to know about the cars? well you can literally blow up a car by running into it with yours if it's fast enough. unavoidable death to teh opposing side. you can't shoot trough windows. takes forever to blow up teh car (unless you got a real money bought weapon) , which the driver gets a notification 10 full seconds before. unless ofcourse you got a rocket launcher. which insta kills anything, you can't really miss. and if you don't have a payed for gun. don't even think about shooting at a guy with a launcher. he will turn around and set you flying off better than north koreas rocket program.  oh you want guns? well you either buy it again every 10 days or you pay real money for it. even up to 40$. not even kidding.  only the basic concept of the game is good. but the game is literally designed to minimize skill out of the game. thus having better guns be an absolute grindfiest to get. or you pay for it. in real money.  only 2 good things, the character creation is actually quite good, but since it allows you to change your height, there is absolutetly no headshot dmg multiplier of sorts. hit him anywhere adn the same dmg is applie.  and for the otehr ofcourse the uninstall process. this game is horrible.
10386	1	a	the one good thing about it not being high quality is that its not very laggy
6911	0	a	its like gta but this game is awful
6671	0	a	APB wont Start and it crashed my computer 10 times.I dont recomend you this game if you want your computer to lag like hell or crash.
3902	0	a	game is pay to win, community is a hybrid of league of legends and middle school edge, gameplay is fun but ruined by these two factors
7565	0	a	I've been playing APB Reloaded before any of this new breed stuff was even talked about while yes the game is free and quite fun it is a open world RPGMMO but heres the thing the majority of the people in the game are basically maxed out in R wepons and cars which makes actually starting new very very hard the game is quite aggrivating when the missions are one sidded which they most usually are i love the game i truly do but would i honestly wouldnt recomend it to anyone new unless i had a group that is constantly playing this game which i do not.
4150	0	a	Its like a frog.  It croaks, then totally derps and and falls into the water, drowning itself in the process.  Black screen.  1/10

1026	1	a	really good game but you need really good wifi to make it work top noch id give the game 97-100
7417	0	a	Now I dont have 1000 hours plus in this game like some people here but Ive seen enough to make a fair verdict. As a noob its hard to pick up like most games. But in order to combat the higher ranking played s you either must get MLG or pay 40 bucks for a weapon. (real moeny) You could buy the weapon for a few days but then after that your screwed. I am no means good at the game but I'd like to think Im more of a novice as I was ranked silver 2 I believe? (This is actualy decent in this game not like CSGO) The whole conecpt is pretty cool and the customization amazing. But the whole combat and progression system is really hard to get used to. If anyone has anything to say about my verdict (like my opion matters) please tell me, am I just bad? am I using the wrong guns? Or am I just doing everything wrong? But for now, this game needs some serious balancing issues.
2962	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
6819	0	a	Practically the best Pay to Win game ever! If you're broke, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! :D
9360	0	a	Go play a real game.
2246	1	a	APB Reloaded to me is one of the best free to play games that you can play, as its not overly difficult to play unless you are really into it, new players can get a few free bonuses like a few free codes to get in game premium so they earn more money and level up quicker with the contacts, the more you play and the better you play the better your skill will get, and the better skill you get the more chance you have of rising in threat level.  There are 5 threat levels, new accounts are T Rank (Trainee) then you have Green threat, which is a player has not won a mission when they leave trainee, then you have bronze which shows that they are not that good at the game, then silver threat which means they are good, but not all the time, then there is gold threat which is someone who is dedicated to the game and never wants to lose and are the most dangerous players to be pitted against if they are max rank in the game which is 255.   It takes a long time to get there, I have spent about 600+ hours on that character and I got her to max rank and gold threat and you can also have a customized character, like my character at this moment looks like she is a paramilitary as she is wearing a big chest rig with some ammo pouches on it, a long sleeved shirt, some cargo pants with knee pads and boots. With any F2P game there are micro transactions, and I fell for it like most have and spent some money on the game, which was a mistake if I am honest as most of my items were bought for me by my clan mates.  the only downside to this game is the amount of people who dislike the game because if the developers and play this game to just purely put in the chat on how bad this game is and putting in a lot of hate comments and sometimes even racial slurs, there is also the downside of the amount of hackers that his game have, itâs rare to find one but they are easy to spot when you find them, and they do get banned after a while but they will come back, and it is also very infuriating when this happens, and another bad thing about APB is that the servers and the game engine don't really like people being on them as there is a lot o lag due to the engine and the servers are also quite bad sometimes as say they are European even though I have 110 MS and it is noticeable
448	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME THIS GAME IS THE BEST I PLAY IT EVERYDAY I LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME  give me creditz now plz
9037	1	a	Fallen Earth is an RPG which offers a wide range of activities. According to me this is one of the best RPG offered in the world of videogames. It's not pay to win and it can also be considered a mix of Fallout and MadMax. Why?. Because it offers a wide map, such as Gran Canyon and veichles are available. You can drive a wide range of veichles such as ATV, motorbikes, choppers, Dune Buggy, sport totally customizable (there are even animals to mount)!. For people who think that it could be pay to win, i am able to tell you that it's not pay to win, you do not have to pay anything to be stronger than other players! There is people who tell that Fallen Earth is dead. This is not true. The number of players is increasing but at the same time some players stop to play because it's a a bit hard as RPG, but do not worry about it, you'll can join a clan which will help you to learn how to play and how to be stronger! Furthermore this game is also playable by players who have a low end PC, so don't worry about FPS.
3573	1	a	Amazing customization GTA like gameplay online anarchy i love this game!

10289	1	a	Just wish I could play it on GNU/Linux. Then I could finally leave Windows behind.
667	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâs new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010âs deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâs devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâs missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâs problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
4079	0	a	This game is broken... I downloaded the game off the official website and it would not let me launch it up. So i deleted the files and downloaded it off steam and yet again would not let me play. So i tryed to delete it again and it would not let me, even now as i write this review it says im playing APB, but i'm not. I dont know if this a common problem but personaly i am pretty disapointed.
3939	0	a	Doesn't feel finished, unfinished, pay to win, crap. Save yourself the disk space, unless you're really desparate.
9587	1	a	This game is a preety good game it has been a while since the last time i played it but it was a really good game but it takes a while of getting uset to, But dont expect to fall in love with the game right away you have to give the game a chance.

6808	0	a	1,300 hours later and I still manage to want to play this game. Customization is fantastic and it's one of the main aspects of this game along with the 'run-n-gun' style of third-person shooting. The graphics are unupdated, the optimization is horrible and has been for an extended period of time, the matchmaking has yet to be improved, micro purchases out of your â¥â¥â¥, if you have the G1C that is. A community of some veterens but mostly hackers and rerollers with 5 dollar wall hacks, aimbots, or a 40 dollar trial gun. The game itself is fantastic but the key aspects around it are dragging it down.
1859	1	a	one of the best games ive played on steam 
460	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
3569	1	a	PLS MAKE IT FOR MAC I LOVE DAT GAME
8087	0	a	apb reloaded is fun and all but why didn't the dynamic events=drug mule,the butcher, why didnt they come up anymore they should actually start doing drug mule and butcher and im almost finished with the tutorial but how am i gonna finish the tutorial if u guys didn't put the drug mule or butcher anymore
5368	0	a	This, my friend, is the worst game in the planet. I installed this â¥â¥â¥â¥, got fps drops af with a gtx 1070 and i5 6600, after that killed a team mate, because i was noob af. Then got some weird internet problem (im pretty sure it wasn't a kick, at least it wasn't saying anything like 'You got kicked blablabla')  Meanwhile i was talking with ma bois without any lag.  So i decided to uninstall!  Hope you had a good time reading this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, but serious just buy GTA!
187	1	a	1) Its Free-To-Play 2) Its like GTA 3) But with your friends.
4679	0	a	Its just a very bad P2W-Game: 64% positive reviews. How is that even possible?
9750	0	a	Created an account, and it wont even let me log in. I tried my Steam username/password and the seperate account I had to create and both didn't work. Complete waste of time.
9283	0	a	Deleted this game, after endless re installs, couldn't get the game to load past the character generation screen,
4657	0	a	They put ban for no reason, and you can not do anything to get your account back.  The support team will never ansver on your qostions.  The game itself is good, but if you thinking to play it seriously after some time this game will disappointed you a lot. 
5531	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
7309	0	a	i could ont get it to work 
7093	0	a	This game sucks. way to much bs just to get to the part where you actually play. just a lame game period
5400	0	a	JUST READ IT BEFORE YOU PLAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU FROM A MENTAL BREAKDOWN  F UCK.THIS.S HIT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALVUE YOUR SANITY.At first this game was awesome alright, having fun doing good stacking up the g's. Now my first thing i want to say is that there is A F UCKING R ETARDED GLITCH where when you buy a gun it will charge you for it 2-4 times losing the money you just spend 6 hourss working for. Next complain. ALOT OF THE PEOPLE, mostly the criminals, WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE F UCKING D IPSHIT A SSHOLES WHO FEEL THE NEED TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THER F UCKING MICRO P ENIS'. When your trying to earn chash,the point of the game, you'll have people who decive you, say they will help you and right before you are about to get money they will f ucking r ape you and give you their F UCKING AIDS so that you die and they can steal your money. Next, when your in a van your IMMEDEA TELY F UCKED; having a van basically says 'hey im transporting a s hit load of money come and f ucking get it you c unts'. Now that will trigger all the squeakers around you and they will immedeatly flock to your a sshole trying to wait for you to get out of your van to steal your it, the f ucked up thing is that you need to leave the van to stat making the money, not going to explain ho because it will take too long. Just image the scene from finding nemo with the seagulls, great now replace them with R ETARDED 7 YEAR OLDS. Ok, my final point is that one of the easiest ways to make money is ram raiding which is what i have been talking about mostly, when you have been sweating your a sshole off for the past century to the point where it's dicintegrating your gonna have a nice fat stack of chash available in the back of your van. When/If you get to turn this in with out the f uckboy's around stalking you. Your gonna be on the map if you have above 2.5k dollars. When you've been working THAT F UCKING LONG AND THAT F UCKING HARD AND YOU GET IMMEDEATLY F UCKED IN THE A SS AND YOUR MONEYS BEEN STOLEN YOUR SOUL GETS SUCKED OUT OF YOUR A SS AND YOU WASTE 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE ME WRITING A RAGE REVIEW ON STEAM BECAUSE ANGER IF THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. And so concludes my review/essay on why never the play this CANCER GAME.
8806	0	a	I don't recommend this game for a number of reasons  1. Takes a hour and 1/4 of a hour just to set it up and play the damn game  2. Vey laggy, laggiest game I ever played on Steam  and 3. The loading times, are so damn slow!
9156	0	a	Has allot of potential. Devs don't give enough attention to it though in the areas that it needs large amounts of improvement. My main complaint isn't the fighting physics (while they aren't very good, being that you select a monster/person and just let your character hit them over and over again on their own, think world of warcraft in a free2play game) but instead the hook to come back and play more. I just simply couldn't get immersed in the gameplay, it lacked a good storyline, and instead gave out shi tty quests as a way to waste your time. Upgrades are disgustingly expensive, leveling up takes forever, and pvp isn't even under discussion. Plain and simple, imho, its a bad game. But hey, it's free, don't listen to some dipsh its comment you read on steam reviews. Download it and try it yourself, it only took like 2-3 hours.
6552	0	a	Pay to win Game!!!!
7886	0	a	i hate this stupid game i got 6 accounts banned with 5.000$ wasted on them. dont try to play this game and gamersfirst is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all they do is just steal money and bann yourr acc.

7016	0	a	It is almost impossible to kill someone with the first level guns, It takes 30 hits from the 1st rifle in the game to kill someone. Then you get blown away with shotguns and more powerful weapons. This is a pay to win game. I played for a day, and it was mostly dying.....
1760	1	a	Pros: Great game within it self. Has alot of features that just wants you to keep playing!  Cons: You mite find a hacker or two.
8488	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
6794	0	a	Horrible laggy and hard to set controls for motionjoy the regular is ok but need some work
8676	0	a	You start out at a low level wandering the city with bad guns then u get rekt by everyone and thing out in that city cause you're level 1 and everyone else is level 5 million
7689	0	a	this game is like no other game thats i have ever seen befor this game has so many hackers so many glitches and so much profanity its a shame to call that a video game i was very interested in the game and was very very up set i couldnt progress because its such a mess in that game and i hope any parent that sees this game does not buy it for there child this game need to be banned. this is y people are being bullied and pushed around this game is garbage.   p.s. SUCH A SHAME
6075	0	a	lags to much and horible graphics
6659	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
10368	0	a	i beta tested this game it was buggy then. i bought it played for a few weeks. quit because nothing was getting fixed. came back after it went free to play. an the same bugs an the laggy areas where still there. the only thing that changed was . they had change some of the areas too look different.
3838	0	a	Want To Know What I Review of This Game?? Its Unfair ...THe Laggy Driving Is Hard Enough..The FIght System Is sooo Unbalance..Like Your Just Started and Your Already Fighting Some High-End Weaponry Players.. and the community is Sooo Unfriendly like they'll never say nice things to ya..if your a weak asset on their team, 'noob' is the title they'll give you.   My Overall Rating For This is Game is -10/10. ~
8411	0	a	I regret what i've said after a year of playing this game. It used to be good, now it's full of hackers and cheaters. Not a great game to play anymore.....

7503	0	a	All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is a game that invokes many feelings. Off the top of my head, I can name relentless rage, grueling dissapointment, and cocky pride worthy of a guy that just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Ariana Grande.  APB is a great concept. The backstory behind it is very deep, and the entire caracterization of the city of San Paro(however unoriginal that name might be) is very detailed and well done. It doesn't draw black and white lines: it's all a thick mist of grey, and it certainly asks you a question: are the oftentimes corrupt, control-obsessed vigilantes right? Or is it ethically correct to leave the city to the self-proclaimed renegades and anarchists, however chaotic and destructive they might be?  Remember, I'm talking about the CONCEPT here.  Because the realization of said concept is about as clear as a snowstorm in the deep ocean. The backstory and personality of the contacts and city is only presented by tedious text, mainly in the form of emails that most people just delete, or don't even bother to open. I even asked a friend, that has 20 hours clocked in the game, what the Enforcers were: he thought they were just straight-up police officers. That's just how bad the story is brought to the player.  Now for the gameplay. The core is good: Reloaded Productions managed to deliver a good third-person shooter, with interesting weapons and playstyles. The smart player that uses tactics will more often than not have an advantage over the kid that has spent countless dark nights crouched in front of his PC playing Call Of Duty, while perfecting his aim and surviving on Red Bull and Cheetos. However, like almost everything in this King Kong-sized dissapointment, this is ruined by two reasons:  1: The lag. Oh god, the lag. Unless the monthly cost for the servers is 3 bucks plus a cute picture of a cat, I cannot possibly wrap my head around how bad they are. Driving feels like standing on one foot. On a stick. Which is balancing on a banana held by a blind monkey with Parkinson. Often, during a unexpected encounter with a hostile player in the back alleys of the Financial District, I have either died because half of my shots didn't register, or I have won because my opponent's gun wasn't raised-which is a clear indication that some serious lags are going on.  2: The players. Sadly, the smart tactician is a long extinct species in San Paro, and the streets are now ruled by people such as 'Pu$$ySlayer69', 'lole_u_got_buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed' and 'UMAD BRAH??11?'. I am seriously not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you right now, I have seen all three of these names ingame.  Dare to be good, and you'll be called a dirty hacker. Dare to be even slightly worse than either your teammates or your opponents, or equip a weapon they dislike, and you'll be called n00b, â¥â¥â¥, and come to the realization that most of these people have had sexual intercourse with your mother, or that they wish you to do the same.  There are quite some topics I haven't covered, such as the hackers, which constitute, based on other people's calculations, 9,7% of the players. An alarming number, but hard to confirm, so I will leave it there. There is also the company known as GamersFirst. Sadly, these people seem to identify 'Gamer' as 'Man with a lot of money and no need for a honorable fight'. For excruciating prices, you can buy certain weapons that will shred through any average player. (Note that I'm not saying all of them are OP: a decent chunk are either reskins, or equally powerful as the in-game weapons.) The excuse 'you can get it in game too' is true, because you DO unlock modifications and bonuses as you go, but I myself have clocked over a hundred hours and all I got was a useless magazine mod and a slight increase to marksman zoom.  The customization is unrivalled, though. I have tried to find a game, ANY game, that has better character creation or vehicle customization, but to no avail. Shame, because this pearl just had to be incrusted in the (mostly) dried up turd that is APB.  TL;DR: APB: Reloaded is a great concept, that was insufficiently realized by Reloaded Productions, and completely â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by GamersFirst, after they took over the game. You could of course take a look, because, hey, it's free, but greedy business ideals have screwed over the concept so bad that the game is now singing it's dying song.
7765	0	a	If you join a game without being gold rank you will get kicked.
6787	0	a	I played this on its first release and it really broke my heart when it went down for the first time. This was my game and I loved it!  Needless to say I was super excited when I heard that I was going to be revived. It really felt good in the first four to six weeks. I could live with having to rent guns instead of just buying them (ingame-$$$-wise). Then people got greedy and you couldnt even compete with your rented guns. Noobs were â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Golds with their freshly bought gold-guns. Thats when the game died a second time and my heart was shredd.   Didnt touch it for about two years, although I could barely hold me back every now and then... Today I couldnt resist and I jumped into the forums to get a quick glimpse of the game's state. Reading these comments saved my heart from being torn apart a third time. Thank you guys!   TLDR: Sob-story about an awesome game that has been killed by its developers, twice! 2 years of F2P just made it a lot worse.
9432	0	a	Literally Only Played Because I Was Out Of Money Awful Story 0/10
1561	1	a	The game is fairly decent, but I think more can be done to make this game perfect. One of things I believe this game needs is some sort of Campaign or PvE mode. Why you may ask? Well, due to the fact that not everyone is professional at PvP battles. Something like that would defintiely make this FTP game a whole lot more fun. That, and it would probably bring in a lot more players into the game as well.  And with that being said, it's a decent game. Just not perfect...
3929	0	a	This game is just no for now maybe gettin better in the Future...try for yourself you will see D:
10323	1	a	Scratches that fallout itch for post apocalypse good overall free to play. 7/10
7669	0	a	Its beyond boring. no point to it. i tried to play it a billion times and i hated it every time. not worth the free download and space. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.
4748	0	a	I do not recommend this game because it's own and run by Gamers First. Whose real name is actually 'Gamers Last' or 'Gamers? Never!' this company doesn't give a damn about players. Their support is â¥â¥â¥â¥, their 'anti hackware' is not only completely buggy and full of vulnerabilities but they also get countless false hits. They use a program called 'Punkbuster', that 'Scans' your system for anything that 'looks' like a hack tool, often getting false hits (Like Torrent Software, Developer tools, worm scanners, hex editors, anti-virus software, a variety of programs and even other games) and sending it to Punkbuster developers called Evenbalance and the company who owns and moderates the game. And although other games use it, those companies have a filter to tell what is a hack and what isn't.   Gamers First doesn't do this, they will ban you for ANY reason, even if it's unjustified and unreasonable, even if you weren't hacking you will still get perma-banned. No second chances, no investigations, no support, no interactions, no nothing. They will refuse to accept any and all tickets, they won't communicate with you, they won't listen no matter how much sense you make and even if you have proof and evidence that you weren't hacking. They don't give a damn about players. Even if that player is a founder in one of their games and has put a lot of money into funding their games. They KNOW their system is broken, they KNOW their software gives them false hits, they KNOW Punkbuster is the worst anti-cheat software ever made, they KNOW they are banning innocent players all over the place, they just don't care.  Play this game and any game run by Gamers First at your own risk. But don't trust this greedy and cruel company with ANY of your money. Don't buy anything from them. Don't put any money into any of their In-game cash or store items or vanity clothing or anything. They will quickly ban you as soon as they have your money and spit in your face like you were nothing but trash. Because to them, all gamers are trash.   Now for the actual review of the game. This game is what you would call a rage game. It is completely saturated with crap and played only by trolls and children. This game will stress you out and make you want to pull your hair out. It is purely PvP and caters to players who are in clans and gangs. Playing this game solo is not advised as you will get picked on, abused and trolled even from the start. The game is practically almost completely pay to win and because this game is like an MMO GTA game, a lot of kids are drawn to it. This is Gamers First cash child, cause so many dumbasses are freely giving away their money into this piece of crap game.  APB Reloaded is actually monitered closely by the faulty Punkbuster software, and they WILL ban you for no reason. The tiniest hit on ANYTHING that the software *THINKS* is a hack will get you automatically perma banned. Even if you don't have any software that can be mistake for a hack, doing something as simpley as clicking too fast or moving your attack button to your mouse wheel so you can fire semi-automatic weapons rapidly just by scrolling your mouse will get you banned. (Sadly, I read that there have been players banned for doing this, simply using the game's own key binding changing option only to get perma-banned.) What's even more ridiculous, is that there are tech savvy players have figured out ways to bypass the punkbuster software and are aimbotting left and right. Don't believe me? Play the game and do a mission, see that guy who keeps killing you with head shots while sprinting at full speed with a pistol? Yeah he is one of them. While there are hackers rampant in the game, players who *ARE NOT HACKING* are getting perma-banned all over the place.   Still don't believe me? Google Gamers Firsts Bans.  you can also go here.  http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/301621-november-16-false-positive-bans/   ^That statement is false, as my account was one of those mentioned in that post and I never got my account back. And despite this 'claim' gamers first is still banning people unjustly through these 'false positives'. The false positive they got from me is still unclear, as I never cheated in my life in ANY game. Yet one day i get a noticed I got banned for using a 'macro'? okay, sure, whatever. I don't even know how to use macros.  My honest to God recommendation? Avoid this game and all Gamers First games like the plague, there are a lot of games out there that do what these games do but far better.
8414	0	a	By far the worst game 'on the market'. It has easily crumbled to ruins after what the current leaders have done to this game. They let it die and they ruined so much behind it. It used to be a fun, great, addicting game. But now it's a struggle just to even attempt to play the game. The issues that are presented are overwhelmingly frustrating. Let's talk about these flaws.  The connection issues that arose as of late making the game unbearable. The server has some serious kind of issues where the game freezes, your ping spikes up anywhere from 1-200 at this exact moment, your FPS drops up to 50% or more, and you start teleporting or 'rubber banding'. I have never, never in my entire life as a gamer, played an online game that had connections issues this bad. These spikes occur a few times throughout the minute, ranging from a couple to maybe 10 or even more.  Next, we get into the development of the game and who's behind it. Basically, the development is non-existant. This game has barley changed over the course of years. The original developers that had heart and care to make this game great and work on have been gone for quite a long time. We are presented with MEDIOCRE updates time and time again. The only updates that do come out take much too long and bring content that is meaningless. The big picture of this game is a complete failure. A new engine upgrade has been in the works for what, close to two years? Where is that development? We get pictures and false promises. False promises is all that this game is made of. The dev team is quite pathetic no matter what the size. I know teenagers that would do a better job with their amateur development skills in less than 3/4 of the then that of APB devs. And those devs that did stay up until recently are leaving to pursue better things.  There is simply no creativity left. There is nothing left. The game has no quality, it isn't fun to play. It's dying and it's been dying.  In game there are so many issues, so many things that need tweaking. The updates that we do get are horrible and frowned upon by the community time and time again. Lots of aspects in the game that are flawed, don't make sense. Bugs, glitches, stuff that has been here for YEARS completely ignored. Lots of cries that were never heard or reached out to. This is negligence at it's finest. The player never had a say in anything.  They attempted to merge the districts together in order to 'better' matchmaking and open more opportunities. However this was the start of all of the connection issues and the real death of this game. Even with the merge, the servers are very much dead. They have less players than the servers had alone before the merge.  This alone paints the picture of how this game has been going downhill.  Time and time again they neglect their fans that have been loyal all this time. And we get nothing at all in return. Customer support has forever been non existant and they really won't care to help you no matter what kind of issues you have. I have been faced with this multiple times. Gamersfirst staff only care about pushing more sales and more 'joker mystery boxes' because they think this is where the appeal lies. They only ever cared about the money. And nothing else. We are all bent over with our knee-pads on and sodomized terribly to this company.  Tiggs was the worst thing that ever happened to this game. I was never even slightly fond of her. She is just a muppet and her personality, tactics, and loyalties are a disgrace to the game. Why, out of all people, her? Just take a good look at this person and realize that she was a mistake.  Today stands the day where I lost everything I had for this game. There was a time I was so addicted I left my life behind for this game. A time where I considered this the best game of all time for how unique and creative it was, different for the time. It was that fun and addicting. However that is no longer. And if I were to rate this game today as it stands, I would give it maybe a 2.5/10. I even think the worst multiplayer game of all time (Infestation Survivor Stories) puts this game to shame.  I honestly hope that this game dies very soon or gets a major overhaul with a complete new owner and staff. But that won't. Once this game dies it will be taken into private hands and modded by fans that will make the game great again.
6714	0	a	Awful game. A lot of glitches to exploit and matchmaking is just awful. Let's not forget the game breaks almost every time you start up so you have to repair it constantly. When I first started playing the game I thought it was pretty good, but the glitch exploits like standing on a moving car and shooting rockets so you don't have a chance protecting the vip started getting old. Also people not in the misson ram and flip you so the people on the other team can kill you.
4729	0	a	Game is really good especialy if you play with friends. The freedom of customization is one of the best i saw. But I wont play this game until it is so unfinished, random fps drops, bugs are just awfull.
6731	0	a	Not a good game. Much cheater, nobody to punish them. Glitch and cheat it's all you have to rememeber, people use auto aim and others glitch with game mecanical ( sit on the roof of a car to cancel a a debuff of speed)  COmmunity is very worst , people insult and just hit your car to make annoy you (its bring nothing just loosing you time)  THere is a mtchmaker in game but unfortunally it's the worst i never saw, you fight againt high level and high skilled people so you can't do nothing and you can't progress becasue oyu die every time.
5047	0	a	this game in my opinion is terrible, yes it may have good customization but down to the fighting, and driving. It feels like im driving a noodle with wheels. and the guns sound like a hammer hitting the wall, i would not recomend this game to any one, unless they are looking for a social game!
7815	0	a	It's so good it's bad
2101	1	a	i honestly think this game is cool but after playing a couple mounths of it, it gets old and i start to rage it seams that there is a good comunity and a bad one in thisgame there are some hackers nto alot tho so i would recomend that you guys try it for your self.
4580	0	a	This. Is NOT one of the good ones. Beta was great, now its just full of P2W items and teamkilling â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sure the reviews are ''mostly postive'' but aint nothin positive about this game.
8628	0	a	I dont recommend this game. 2 hours in loading ....
4902	0	a	I Wouldn't Let My Worst Enemy Touch This Garbage (Played This Like A Year Ago And Decided To Make A Review)
10714	1	a	This game breaks the rules of an FPS, it looks like a battlefield because it has very large maps, but also takes a lot from the games arena to say that looks a lot like HALO because you can't aim for as long as you do not have a sniper, however a nice game Free to play so much fun and you don't need to pay anything to be good
668	1	a	Nice TPS, still needs some fix but it is nice to play on free time.

(Sadly, I read that there have been players banned for doing this, simply using the game's own key binding changing option only to get perma-banned.) What's even more ridiculous, is that there are tech savvy players have figured out ways to bypass the punkbuster software and are aimbotting left and right. Don't believe me? Play the game and do a mission, see that guy who keeps killing you with head shots while sprinting at full speed with a pistol? Yeah he is one of them. While there are hackers rampant in the game, players who *ARE NOT HACKING* are getting perma-banned all over the place.   Still don't believe me? Google Gamers Firsts Bans.  you can also go here.  http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/301621-november-16-false-positive-bans/   ^That statement is false, as my account was one of those mentioned in that post and I never got my account back. And despite this 'claim' gamers first is still banning people unjustly through these 'false positives'. The false positive they got from me is still unclear, as I never cheated in my life in ANY game. Yet one day i get a noticed I got banned for using a 'macro'? okay, sure, whatever. I don't even know how to use macros.  My honest to God recommendation? Avoid this game and all Gamers First games like the plague, there are a lot of games out there that do what these games do but far better.
10723	1	a	i actually have many more hours in Tribes on a different steam account, 158 more. this game is amazing, with a great community and fun, unique aspects that many shooters would benefit from trying to implement. while graphics may not be amazing, the game runs fluidly and actually looks great thanks to the ambient effects.
8893	0	a	Well, despite the fact I have 101.9 hours playing this game on Steam, I am a veteran that played it almost 2-3 years, when it became F2P (yes, this game was once paid), stopped for a period of 5 years, and came back to play again. So my review will have lots of comparisons with the former years I've played.  Long story short: Actual state of the game is almost --dead--. No other word to define it. Few players (barely 60-70), counting with the newer players that come slowly in numbers. The peak number of players, I suppose, never reached 200 or maybe 250. You will understand that this number is important when you know the HUGE extension of map.  I will now point the most important details that will explain my veredict:   OBS.: It is a HUGE text with plenty of details. You were warned.   1. Features and Gameplay  Fallen Earth implements very nice features, specially in terms of crafting and item reuse in crafting, that means, sometimes you need a specific craftable item to craft a better one. So, you won't waste a ton of items just to grind th hell of your crafting skill and throw away all â¥â¥â¥â¥ you built to the air as it wasn't important. It was (when there was a handful of players around), now it is NOT anymore.  Gameplay is still kinda robotic, with some need for grinding. Yeah, it is not a freaking grind, because there are plenty of missions, and most of them, are related OR with the linear storyline, or with a sidestory that reflects one specific situation, like, the reason of a decaying state of a city, per example. So you don't need to kill thousands of mutants to just earn levels. Just do the missions.  The need of teamwork only is vital on the last level (55) when you reach a region called Alpha County, where the mobs are very difficult to beat alone, specially if you're a full crafter. On some middle-level bosses there is also one need of teamwork, but mainly, after you reach 55. And it has no meaning because the missions in Aplha County give mostly chips (ingame money), experience (that you won't need as you've reached the cap) and, a few of those missions, faction reputation. So, in a basis, no one does those missions because there is no need to do so.  2. Missions  As I've said, the missions are quite well made, and have some history behind (some of them). But indeed they're very straightforward (kill x wolves, collect y materials, destroy z element). There are no puzzles, nothing that could difficult the conclusion of a mission except for one or another boss that has a big pool of health and so you need some friends to finish it. Apart from that, easy missions, nothing spectacular, nothing puzzling. Just normal missions that follows one sidestory or the main storyline.  The only exception are the Defense Towns, where there is a mission to maintain one player-built town (it has 4 in total in game) and, from time to time, a big raid distributed in various waves appear to storm this city. The mission asks you and the other players to defend the town and counter this raid. Remember teamwork? If you don't have it, you lose the city, the city that you and other players built, and can rebuild again if lose. Why that? What's the advantage? Resource nodes around the town, plenty of them appears depending on which buildings were constructed. Trust me, it worths.  3. Crafting  Here is the jewel of the game, and I really thumbs up for this. The game has a complex crafting system, where you have a wide range of melee weapons (hammers, pickaxes, slesgehammers and even a big bar with a 40kg weight), ranged weapons (pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers), various armors and clothes, food and drink, buildings (generally temporary, except from Defense Town buildings), vehicles parts and vehicles assemble, live mounts (horses and wolves), medicine items, poisons, grenades, bombs. The variety is damn extensive, and everything has its purpose: help you against the dangers of the Wastes (including other players). Full crafters have some fun unlocking complex recipes and distribute the products for your clanmates or the open market (Auction house), and this is one thing Fallen Earth still maintains on a positive stats.  4. PvP  The PvP on this game has a freaking damn potential, because it is firmed in one thing: the Faction Wheel. First things first: on a determined level, you need to choose a faction. There are six, i won't go into details, but if you choose one, you start to build some reputation with the faction (throught certain missions) you chose mainly, and with two other factions on a lower basis. On the other side, the other three becomes your enemies (your reputation with them diminshes on the same amount you earn for your faction and allies).  Inside the huge territory of FE, there are PvP areas with outposts or keeps, where a faction that takes control of that keep, rules the area, and has some benefits, including special resource nodes and the option to lay down harvesters (resource drillers). When the game had a big amount of active players (5 years ago), the fight for power was so imense AND insane, that keeps and fortresses normally were conquered and reconquered within one or two hours (counting that it has 45 minutes of immunity after it is capped).  The actual state of PvP is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, because there are not enough players to maintain an all-out war or a domination war over the PvP areas. You even find one or other flag caps, but nothing near the PvP state of 5 years ago.  5. The company (Gamers First)  I could say a bunch of bad things about G1, because, there are mostly only bad things about them related to FE. Suffice to say, when G1 bought FE from Reloaded Productions/Icarus Studios and changed the business model to F2P, a massive number of players quit the game on the next weeks, they knew what exactly would happen with the game, even with the fact Reloaded team would keep working on the game changes and new expansions. G1's legacy in turn one succesful game in â¥â¥â¥â¥ is long and bold. Just ask the players of APB: Reloaded how the game is now. FE isn't an exception: the only news we, FE players, see are the Subscribers Rewards every month, mostly. Fallen Earth became, for G1, another reasonable source of money from subs, veteran players who still manage to like the game despite the lack of improvement over the years (only one new map expansion, a few new vehicles and gear and a new PvE coop mode called The Dome, all this in 5 years ... FIVE YEARS!!!!). What I could say to G1?? Follow the example of Keen Software House and 'Space Engineers' game title. One update every week, either bug fixings or new improvements, EVERY WEEK FOR BLESSED 1 and 1/2 YEARS!!  Conclusion  I'd say, if you want one good experience of free open world game, you can even try Fallen Earth. It is a nice experience. You can still get addicted, but BE SURE that the end game, from the day of that review, is frustrating. To be very honest, the word that resumes all my experience from 5 years ago and now is this:  frustration . But well, I have friends on this game, so that's why I still play. And the game has some nice features (thanks to Icarus Studios) I do study to develop something similar, so that's why I play. But, after all, considering the whole product and its actual state, I do NOT recommend the game.
6656	0	a	p2w so hard, however I wouldn't even recommend this to you p2w kids cause the people not paying are hackers. the little bit that's untainted by the greed of the first 2 groups is broken or just not good. has the potential to be awesome but it's not gonna happen
6141	0	a	A Pay2Win game with a pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community to boot.
4948	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
10267	1	a	not to bad, but if your playing in a group its a pain in the A** to find them.
10329	1	a	I've had so much fun running around, picking up bits of plastic :)
8838	0	a	I dont know how much time I put into this game some reason it isnt even in my steam library anymore. I had fun while I played the game but it got repetitive very quickly. There werent a lot of people playing it a few years ago I imagine the amount is a lot less now.
38	1	a	Anyone looking for a new kind of MMO should give APB: Reloaded a download. While the Armas Marketplace offers a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and aesthetic items be assured that this is a well balanced Free to Play title and requires no purchase for the full experience. Character customization reaches a whole new level with their persona, outfit, vehicle, and symbol editors and the maps themselves are created with great detail.  Though the game can be difficult to learn at first, as the mechanics are quite different from most other open-world shooters, and the Armas Marketplace suffers from the same tragically over-inflated prices that most Free to Play games tend to this is a very solid game with a lot to offer. Action is always guaranteed and with plenty of unlocks and mission types you're sure to find yourself unable to walk away easily.
5721	0	a	i just dont have so much to say...never installing and its bad,its just bad
9733	0	a	This game shouldn't be free to play, it's so bad that they should have to pay you to play it
2442	1	a	Pretty Legit
3534	1	a	Got ran over by my friend and lost 60k  12/10 would work so hard again
2078	1	a	After having a lot of problems trying to actually play the game, I finally got to play it! It's great fun, very balanced, and has hours of gameplay!
8936	1	a	Population is thin. Other wise a great game. It'll take yer time and replace it with fond recalls of how the wasteland was so grinding to collect crap off the land and npcs' bodys.
6211	0	a	the server is very lag!
7203	0	a	pros: My character looks like Arnold schwarzenegger cons: Everything else!
9654	0	a	This game seems like it would be cool, but i cant get past the first part because the game crashes after i kill the first guy. When i go to options to turn graphics down, it immediantly glitches and closes the option menu out. Take my first experience with the game in consideration when you try to get it. Otherwise, it looks like it would be cool.....if it didnt crash every five seconds.
10614	1	a	One of the best FPS games out there. Plus it's free
191	1	a	This is one of the most fun games i have ever played!   But. This can get really annoying with all the hackers and players that are on the wrong server (Gold on Bronze and Silver). 
2042	1	a	You respond to flash points or crimes in progress, and complete vital Enforcer operations, keeping the city under tight control. Rewards are paid automatically. Vehicles, weapons and equipment are at your disposal, but as a private citizen, these must be purchased from your own funds. How you choose to look is your own affair. At all times, you must be ready to use lethal or non-lethal force against Criminal insurgents, as authorized in the terms of your license.  Your authority comes straight from the Mayor herself.  San Paro is at war. Protect your city. Now get out there and â¥â¥â¥â¥ up some Crims!
9104	0	a	This game fricken sucks this game makes me mad, it represtents fault and a whole lotta lagg, Im sorry but its true I did not like fallen earth.  (sing)
9048	1	a	Meh okay repedative but overall fun
10214	1	a	Good game for the price lol
413	1	a	A unique take on an open-world cops 'n robbers theme. Pretty fair business model, hard to master gameplay.  Easy team-ups and regular updates in holiday themes make this one a very fun co-op experience.  Edit : Playerbase dropped badly due to promises not held by devs.
8139	0	a	Truely awful. You will just die, and die, and die by simply overpowered players that have put their money into the grind machine to quickly unlock the best possible weapons that will one shot you before you can blink. No tutorial that I noticed, and no match making, just thrown into a mess. Appalling game.
224	1	a	This game is really fun and keeps me wanting to come back and play after months! That's what my friend told me, I wouldn't know though because I can't run it.
9799	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
7125	0	a	Wellfare GTA 5 Online.  With somehow even more hackers.
2360	1	a	Love it 5/5 stars
1869	1	a	Clocking in 1k hours in this game really makes me see how much i love it. It's been a while now since i played because once you reach the top levels the progress is a bit slow and the updates takes a long time to come out.  The new anti-cheat system really have cleaned up the game and the name-shaming in the chat is not nearly as bad as before which makes the game more fun and nice to spend time in.  Make sure you get some friends in Skype/Teamspeak or similar and play together, that is how the game should be played.  I am definatly returning to the game when the Unreal Engine 3.5 update rolls out!
3890	0	a	Their support is terrible and you will get randomly banned at any point in time.  Their system 'fair-fight' is a mockup puppet system which allows they to flag any account and make it look like they where detected.  Save your money and do not support this company.
4251	0	a	Played it for a little bit.  Didn't care for it very much.
0	1	a	I got killed by a car going 3mp/h.  10/10
6500	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
4257	0	a	its like GTA but with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier community and â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls
8849	0	a	Outdated game that is desperate for players... unbanned me after 6 years...
3026	1	a	good to play with friends

8297	0	a	Hungry â¥â¥â¥â¥ing devs and wasted my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money.  1, This game just wasted my money.I regret playing this game. u messed up and then u need to create a new account and play again and over and over again.  2.â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphics Even with Max Settings.  3.No F2P servers.  4.2op players is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unfair.  5.uninstalling the game is so good.  6.made me break my computer.  7.i rate this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥/  1/10 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ing uninstall this game again.  
965	1	a	I recommend playing it but I cant get it to load.
7749	0	a	if you like constant run ins with cheaters/aimbotters/wallhacking all that crap then this is the game for you, if not steer away from it they have punkbuster but it doesnt do anything cheaters run rampant and on the weekends they are ever present G1 doesnt do anything to stop them either or even try
2350	1	a	its a good game
8758	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
8825	0	a	The game USE to be good and full of players a lot like how Payday is. However its no longer the case and the game is dead with really no players and horrible layout. Theres no HUD or mini map, I did like how there was no real story to the game however without any story you don't know the point. I will say this game beats Half Life in terms of ragdoll effect I wish they added cross hairs.
8254	0	a	Total control of charactor creation look is kinda cool. The game itself is a bit clunky and the shooter part is annoying. It lags some and there are plenty of people out there with exploits. I got addicted to this game until I finally realized it's full of 12yo's or people with the mind of a 12yo and all anyone wants to do is throw dumb insults around. The only thing about it that makes it worth downloading is that it's free to play.
1187	1	a	this game siad that i cant play becuse d3dx9_43.dll
5275	0	a	Jesus Christ is my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
295	1	a	OMG BEST GTA CLONE EVER GUYS (and girls) PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!Â£!Â£!$'$%
9555	0	a	HEAVILY touched up 'Screenshots' mislead you. This game does not look half as pretty as they mislead you to believe.   It is a 6/10 average MMO
378	1	a	Only real reason to play this game is the customization. Other then that, it's a broken piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that has potential to be a real good game.
970	1	a	Great game with some awesome Customizing, only thing i hate about this game is that the weapons you buy are only 7 Days, unless you buy 'em with real money. 
4449	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
8246	0	a	I have put about 900 hours in this game. Now, after 2 years, I gave it another try. Absolutely nothing has changed. Couple of new contacts and that's it. Game still has a lot of cheaters, still p2w as ever, still terrible community etc...  First thing you see when you log in is Armas marketplace window popping up trying to shove all the expensive p2w stuff and cosmetics in your face. Absolutely ridiculous.  Still terrible matchmaking, gold disctricts are empty, the cars that were before exclusive for crims are now available to enforcers and vice versa (â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money grab much G1!?), still unbalanced weapons, still hitreg problems, still no new servers, nothing... The only thing that this game does is releasing new armas content so people can spend more money.  One thing I have to admit, it's one of those games that are very addictive. It's a fun game to play if you can ignore all the issues, so it's a shame devs are not interested to make something of this game. So, for everyone that has never played this game, don't do it. Trust me, save your sanity. The game is very hard to get into for newcomers and community is absolutely terrible. I have never seen anyone helping new players in this game, true talk.
2335	1	a	this online game is fun and there is always something to do like if your and police officer you chase down criminals and if your a criminal you steal,kill,destroy etc... could be better in graphics but apart from that its a fun game to play. If i had to rate this game out of 10 i would give it a 8
6218	0	a	If you are looking for a pay to win game then you have come to the right game!!
4411	0	a	got banned for no reason and the severs sux
1066	1	a	I love this game but i wish it wasnt so hard on my pc 
4850	0	a	Honestly it's the best bad game I ever played. But in the end I'm sad I spent nearly 4 years playing it and almost 6 months of actual play time invested (that's 4k and a few hours) ( and no I don't login with steam often so it's less here.) that I will never get back, don't be fooled by the new paintjob it got with FF, FF is a s-hit anticheat and does nothing to save this game just move right along and play another game. Trust me it's not worth the time get good at a better or more important game.
6632	0	a	saints row, free to play version with all the features that you will never use. you need friends to play this and it's still boring most of the time
3475	1	a	You can still get money for them big ole heavy tvs' from the shop! I think the games time frame is first nokia phone thru right before flat screen tv.
1755	1	a	Take Grand Theft Auto V. Take 20 - 30% of the features out. Make it slightly more complicated. And BOOM! You've just made APB Reloaded.
2222	1	a	Greatest game ever, worst comunity ever. MONEY . The biggest problem . It will destroy this game, everybody is so focused to get money from customers and give them â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest service ever. I dont know if that is trend in 21th century. But every fuc*ing single game that has been created around 2007-now is so damn focused to get money from players so much that i am sick of that, the corruption is spreading all over the developing studios. Everybody want to get fuc*ing rich, but they forgot about happines... So yeah , fuc* you all developers, delete my review if you want, but the message would be here, spreading and corrupting your tricky bussines. Game creators should not be rich. Remember that. Its a work, not a fuc*ing slavery for us, the players. Dont make us suffer for your obsession with money. We want to play and relax, you should not pay for relax. I have an idea for you, you see those banners ingame ? What if you insert in those som Ads from internet and make money from that ? Would not be that smarter ?
9114	1	a	Pretty nice game without bugs but got serious in upgrading quality and communication with people there. Final score 6.5
9459	0	a	apparently this used to be enjoyable. but at this point its just pay to win.
4728	0	a	If you are reading this review, then you probably haven't played the game yet.  Don't. Just don't.   You'll be put in against everybody with grenade launchers and LMGs while you're stuck with the worst guns possible. The Silver and Gold tiers of players are loaded with hackers, most of which gave up playing legit and got their hacks just to be able to compete with the other hackers, because that makes so much sense.

4487	0	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this pay2win game!!!!!!!
4123	0	a	I personally didn't like it. It was very confusing and I didn't know what was going on a lot of the time. I felt like I was forced into quests when I had no clue what to do. Not only that, but the lag was horrible. Everything mixed together and made a very bad experience for me and I was discouraged to play again and because of that I never played it again so I just uninstalled it. Thankfully it's a F2P, so if you want to give it a try, I won't stop you.

8873	1	a	You may have heard this game is buggy. That is an understatment. You may have heard this game is full of chat and PvP trolls. Well I am not going to argue against that. The things is I would not normally tolerate that from a game. It is unacceptable.  The game however is in a league of its own. I cannot take my business elsewhere. There is no Elsewhere. Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that does not always look the prettiest but actually provides you with a massive world where there is a point to going off exploring. Resources are everywhere. Everything is needed in someway and almost everything has to be crafted by players.  Character development is very customizable both in terms of appearance and performance. All clones are created equal but some are developed poorly. It is an easy system to learn, but much tweaking availiable when mastered. Fallen Earth really is the MMO you can play your way. Every clone can find a niche. Fallen Earth is not at all P2W, with the only advantages being convenience and cosmetics for cashers. Even a subscription can be bought with in game currency. The community has many helpful players and questions are answered quickly via the help channel. If you start playing use the help channel. The game is quite simple to learn but not very well explained by the game itself. Stick with it. Each in-game sector brings fun and different game mechanics. Do not be in a hurry in this game. Speed levelling when you don't know much is a very bad idea.
1249	1	a	I live under the bridge after this game.... 10/10 would fall for that cash shop again.
4100	0	a	Community. Enough said.
10183	1	a	Positive: i absolutely love this game although i may not have much hours on it due to how busy i am, i still have some free time to play this game i love the graphics and i love how its not pushing you into doing things (in other words they are not forcing missions on you) i would recommend this game to anyone who loves medium paced games and games that you can basically do whatever you want. the only thing that i am not a big fan of is the price of gas for my atv, other than that this game is overall it is an okay game. Negative: although i may have a good review above i think i should put some negatives in the review. it has extreme lag even for my friend who happens to have great intenet and a beefy pc, the game needs to have seperate servers and it also needs to have a singleplayer added even if the servers cant be added due to money just add a singleplayer mode. i honestly think that the game needs to have a plot that actually goes somewhere, i may not have a ton of hours on it but i can tell by where i am at now the plot goes nowhere. i hate how people can interfere with your missions, it really sucks how i am doing a mission and soe other person can come up and kill everyone so i have to wait a while for them to respawn and have to basically restart. oh and on a recent mission i was not told how to use the weapon that they gave me so it took me 15 minutes to get someone to tell me how to use it and it was too late because i had 30 minutes to do the mission and i didnt finish it in time.  i would give this game a 5/10
5754	0	a	i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, infact me and my fiancee are furious with this game. 2/3 years ago, i use to play alot and loved it. but sadly to say duty called and left for basic, and now time has passed, i am overseas and have time to kill and downloaded this game and was not able to get on. i talk to an admin and they were very rude, and straight up said they due not to lift the supposed perm ban they have on me for no reason. they said my account violated there rules and would not tell me how. i never talk in chat and spent all my time doing missions, and most of it was trying to build a dream car. sadly to say game also rob me of my money. i paid for premium for 1 month which i know i wont get that back, but i also spent money on a vehicle and will most likely not see that too, and that's what has us furious. i was a valued customer to them and actually put some money in, and some how i violated there rules? seeing other people comments left here shows i was not the only one who is having these issues.   please do yourself the favor and just find another game. they will rob you of your money and time and effort into the game and then most likely ban you for some reason they decide whether you did it or not. seems like a scam to get you to make another account to make people come back, they only ban your account and not ip. seems odd but yeah. Switching to grand theft auto 5 was the best decision ever. but if anyone has any games that allows me to build trucks and customize them. please let me know!  and again, don't download the game save your time!

798	1	a	Awesome game if u expect cheaters/hackers !!!
65	1	a	If the game got rid of it's pay-to-win elements and instead just priced it at $5 or somewhere close, the game would be a slam dunk. It's all you ever wanted out of an online GTA, and better than GTA V online, purely based on mechanics. Sure, the vehicles, guns, and graphics might not be as competitive, but the mechanics are what really matters. The bonding between you and your crew as you ram storefronts and run over pedestrians all whilst shooting at the police makes it worth putting up with the cheap feeling you get from the pay-to-win crap.
97	1	a	Dont let the majority of negative reviews turn you down. I wil admit this game stil need work (performance wise)   But the major problem i see , is that most players dont know what Squad based tactical shooter is. If u join a random group you wil see that almost everybody just rushes to the objective (like its COD) thinking they can do it alone?  But if u sit down, create a team / communicate and play smart its actualy way more fun and u have a good chance of winning.  For this i believe most of the negative reviews are written by them Call of Duty / Leageu of legends players who just arent used to being pacient.   The rushed player wil die a lot and dislike this game. The Pacient player that thinks before he runs in will have more fun and enjoy the game more!   Simply get your friends together before u jump into APB =) Dont be focussed on the *winning* part and its a lot of fun and fierce competition that ive always enjoy sinds the launch of APB.  The only downsides are the Performance isseus's   (ps. only noobs complain about the weapons) 
6216	0	a	With GTA V Online, this game is more redundant than ever before.
855	1	a	APB Reloaded is a open world cops and robbers set gameplay. Im going to go through pros and cons of th game Pros- Very fun gameplay  PvP is great Missions are very enjoyable with friends Noob friendly UI  Cons- Very much pay to win Scrubbies everywhere with $100 guns spraying you down   Be sure to join bronze and silver ques or you will get destroyed!!!  I would reccomend but be prepared to spend $20-$50 on guns, clothes etc...
1311	1	a	i enjoyed it very much but it does kind of fall under the p2w category sadly but over all it was pretty good
4820	0	a	This game barley works... :l
3778	0	a	 Mission objective: Pick-up briefcase and hold it for as long as you can   Three other players and I jump into a car and race for the pick-up location. We are just one corner shy of the destination, when an RPG comes flying in out of nowhere and sends us all into oblivion. The camera pans to a female player that looks like she just finished filming a scene for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  One team member and I spawn at a nearbly location and rush towards the briefcase, which is now being held by gentleman sporting a trendy mohawk, sprinting through the narrow back alleys. We hide behind a wall and wait for the enemy to come closer. Suddenly, my co-player gets annihilated by a sniper, hiding anywhere between two blocks and half a lightyear away. Knowing that I am about to get killed in any moment, I jump into the alley and start spraying the gentleman with bullets. By the time I'm halfway through my magazine, he had already dropped the valuable cargo and started firing towards me. Two deadly shots after that and my lifeless body drops to the ground.  At that point, I see that my two other team-mates arrived with a windowless van, that looked like it belonged to somebody who likes to attract children's attention with candy. The copilot was hanging out the window and before he even got the chance to showcase his rat-a-tat maker, he got eliminated by the same marksman that showed his hunting prowess just moments before I died. The driver managed to leap out of the van, but got mowed down by a machine gun faster than a teenage COD player insults your mother.  We respawned shortly after that and by then, the briefcase was already traveling down a highway. I managed to talk a lovely lady into lending me her beige SUV and my crew jumped inside. The race for pride, honor and briefcase holding privilege had begun. I ran all the red lights on the way, nothing could stop my determination. I even handbraked into a couple of corners and pulled some wild powerslides through them, in a way that would put Sebastien Ogier to shame, all in hopes to catch up with our opponents as quickly as possible. Two kilometers and three squashed pedestrians later, we are on the tail of a menacingly looking vehicle one could only describe as a weird mishap between a Hummer and a soccer-mom's minivan.  My passengers all stuck themselves through the windows and opened fire on the vehicle in front of us. Unfortunately, the passengers of the car in front of us also decided to do the same thing and bullets were now flying towards our car. I started swerving like a mad man, trying to recall moves from Ken Block's latest Gymkhana video, but two of my passengers had already died. I figured the car was already way beyond repair and that there was no way I could ever return it to its owner in this shape, so I decided to go for broke and attempted to ram the car, hoping that it would spin out. I didn't even manage to get near it, when a huge flame burst out of my engine compartment and just moments after that, the car exploded. My buddy and I were burnt to a crisp and we had to start all over again.  The two team-mates that died first had already managed to secure a van and were honking the horn, trying to get us to enter the van. I told the three of them to go ahead, while I went to switch firearms.  Just as I was leaving the police station, I saw a huge truck stopped at an intersection. Thinking that was probably my best chance at doing anything, I hopped in and slowly but surely pulled away. I was driving in the general direction of the briefcase and was picking up speed. Three blocks after that, I was approaching an intersection at a blistering speed and sheer luck had it that the Hummer minivan just came racing through that said intersection and slammed head on into my truck. The truck had no intention of stopping whatsoever and the incredible amount of inertia started shoving the awful looking vehicle towards a building. Nothing could stop the brute force of my truck smashing the car into the wall, crushing it like a car compactor on steroids. The vehicle exploded and a majestic fireball engulfed the remains of the opposing team.  People came from near and far, cheering as I jumped out of the truck and picked up the briefcase. My team arrived just in time, so I hopped into the van and we drove off, ever so slowly. One wouldn't think, but the van really seemed to struggle hauling the extra weight of the briefcase, even if it seemed to be so light when I was carrying it just moments ago. My team complimented me on my spectacular display of driving skills and before I could respond, the unthinkable happened.  An RPG struck the van. And you guessed it, it was Sasha Grey again. I managed to hold the briefcase for twenty whole seconds before it got abruptly taken away again. I watched Sasha walk up to the briefcase and, just before picking it up, whisper: 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ n00b fa*gots'.  Needless to say, we lost that match. I never played ABP after that and to this day, I still question my sexuality due to Sasha's deep words.
10712	1	a	It's a lot of fun, but don't expect to be a pro in the beginning
7516	0	a	I am very disappointed about this game, I was told this game had genitalia and it doesn't, shameful.
7374	0	a	my game simply just wont load up :/
1979	1	a	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice game! xD
1816	1	a	The game is realy nice i love it :3
6904	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
5615	0	a	wasted a minute and a half of my life downloading this game, to waste another 20 minutes getting the game to even start, to waste another 30 minutes trying to figure out why i had a blank black screen but could still hear the game sound, to finally waste another minute in a half figuring out that this game is not windows 10 compatible.....
3760	0	a	If you enjoy playing a game in permanent beta, this game is for you.  While I've clocked many hours (have another 1.5k+ before the steam merge), I don't think I can reccomend this game to anyone. It's just not worth investing time into for new people. Older players only play it because we got hooked early on, and most of us are nostalgic or for some reason holding onto hope for the game.   I wish this game could hit it's potential that it had even back in 2010/2011, but it's not very likely, even with the 'engine update' that's supposed to be here by the end of this year. Don't bet on that though, they also said it was supposed to release back in Q1 2014, and look where we are :). G1 has been worse than Nexon, and that's a great warning sign for anyone interested in trying this game out.   If you're still interested, despite all the negative reviews, by all means go ahead. Just remember, you were warned.
8912	1	a	Cool game to play with your friends/roleplay/explore. The world is pretty cool and the crafting system is neat but it's also a bit grindy. Would recommend for people who like to grind or roleplay with their friends. THANK YOU.
2510	1	a	Hell yeah, awesome game!
7614	0	a	Do not get this game, unfair, pay to win and no fun to play at all :/
2257	1	a	i love this game although its really hard to understand and master i recommend for skilled players and people who can aim very well using a mouse
10521	1	a	Could be one of the best games I've ever played.
6286	0	a	waste of space!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cant even start the game. i have to download a bunch of 3rd party crap. my adivce? stick to GTA
9807	0	a	my guy just spins i cant get him to stop and now ive got a head ache best game evver
4395	0	a	sucks
2543	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate the game 95/100 percs
3232	1	a	Fly around a big city, act like a gangster, pwn noobs trying to break the law, GG.
2683	1	a	This game man. I played it in its original form before it shutdown. I still have never played a game that beats this in character customization. The game itself is fun. More enjoyable with friends. It just feels really cool to be driving around with your buddies and having them hanging out the windows with guns blazing.  Now that the game is free, it is totally worth checking out.
5627	0	a	my poops look better than this game...
7531	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
7411	0	a	even though i match the minimum requirement for playing, i still cant launch the game from the launcher without getting an error and my computer sounding like its about to explode.
7303	0	a	Poor game alot of lag questes marks are not on the map marken propely so this game i would give it a 4/10 very bad i dont think you should play this :l
4390	0	a	APB is like Donald Trump, exciting and amusing at first, but once you get past the bull â¥â¥â¥â¥, it starts to dawn on you how bad they are.  I've had history with this game, and decided to come back. I was bored and needed something to do. Here's a synopsis of how a day in APB goes. 1. Take 30 minutes to log in. 2. Spawn into the world and I become Nightcrawler, with the ability to teleport short distances. 3. Steal a car, try to drive, go across everything but the road. 4. Ready up for a mission, it's a 1v1, guy is already at the objective as we start, i'm 200m away. 5. I meet up with the enemy with my default weapon, fps and lag cooperate to make me spray like hell and somehow get a kill 6. Repeat. 7. Enemy corner Camps objective. 8. He wins. 9. Try to get a better weapon. 10. Don't have enough money. 11. Only way to get a lot is to do missions. 12. I realize I can't do missions with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gun. 13. I try anyway. 14. Guy with shotgun shoots my car while I'm stuck trying to get out of a wall. 15. I blow up. 16. Deletes APB. If you have a beefy computer and like to spend money this game is for you.
4772	0	a	I played this when it was just APB, remember RTW?, yeh that long ago. It was flawed but fun then, When G1 got it, it well went downhill fast, everything is P2W,sooo many hackers and very unstable servers. Also if you log out by cancelling the game by task manager or Alt+Tabing you get banned for hacking...   DO NOT BUY, its ruined.
3638	1	a	I really like this game but the new engine â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the game, so many new updates
6233	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ makes me want to puke!  I swear this is giving me nightmares...
6908	0	a	Would recommend if it weren't for so many hackers and auto-aimers. Almost a good game.. Almost.  8/10 Game 5/10 Game with it's current community
2354	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
9995	1	a	this game is cool 
424	1	a	Its very fast pace for a game like this but still is fun!
566	1	a	I think this game is good time stealer but p2w i would recommend this game :)
1178	1	a	This game is not that bad. i do like it but they got some big time bugs!
6858	0	a	Gamers Last. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this garbage.
5395	0	a	Like GTA, except really really â¥â¥â¥â¥
3372	1	a	Rated A for A-holes.
1280	1	a	11/69
9369	0	a	I couldnt even get into the game after I made my acount.
1905	1	a	Saw butts on a sign and uninstalled.
6810	0	a	pay2win and crappy servers. Do not even consider to download!
832	1	a	f2p gta online. solid gameplay and fun gamestyle
6041	0	a	I couldnt even play because i just got kicked by punkbuster over and over everytime I joined and couldnt play at all
7345	0	a	The game is not bad but...  It is hyper casual; bullet drop/damage are completely silly. If you are looking for a tactical team based competative shooter with realism and skill continue your search or I recommend CS:GO. If you want to have fun screw around and just blow stuff up and play grand theft auto for free, this is your game.  The review may seem harsh but it isn't a bad game just know what you want from your games and play it!
1461	1	a	very good game, no frame drops and no problems... + amazing hitreg
308	1	a	PRO:  -Customization like u never seen before for you char, vehicles, songs, etc...  -Not p2w: after 2k hours on it i can say u that is not p2w at all... Everything u can buy from the shop is just for incrase ur appearence. All the weapons from armas are a re-skin from the ones u can buy from NPCs wich means that the weapons from shop are just a re skinned from the 'free ones'.  -NO CHEATERS: the cheaters are very rare and they are always low levels becouse they get banned within 2 days. When u meet a player lvl 100+ that is kicking ur â¥â¥â¥, it just means you are playing against a skilled guy.  -SKILL: everything that you require to kick asses in this game is SKILL wich is something that the shop can't sell. When u get skills and u start kicking â¥â¥â¥ u will feel the fun.  CONS  -PLAYERS: some skilled players that get tired of being kicked in the butt by even more skilled players than them, they decide to join newbies server just becouse they feel sad so they want to kick someone's â¥â¥â¥ just as their was.  -ADMINS: WHERE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ ARE THE ADMINS IN THIS GAME ? i wish that i see some admins that travel trought servers just for making people calm down and stop the rage and flame in the chat. When and admin join a server (very rare) every player get exited and act like the admin is a 'god'.  -LANGUAGE: racism, cyber bullying, rage, etc... Sometimes that happens to being flamed or just to read very bad words in the server chat... in many languages...   BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF... I WOULD CHANGE MANY STUFF IN THIS GAME, BUT I'M A PLAYER AND NOBODY GIVES A â¥â¥â¥â¥ ABOUT MY WORDS.  SOMETIMES U WOULD LOVE THIS GAME FOR THE FEELING IT GIVES WHEN U KICK PEOPLE'S â¥â¥â¥... BUT SOMETIMES IT GIVES U A VERY HARD TIME WHEN PEOPLE KICK YOURS.
3865	0	a	Back in 2013 I wrote a review for APB, my review consisted of me explaining that it was a good game broken but good, after this review I quit APB for a while (2 years). Recently I came back to APB because I remembered all the good times I used to have and all the fun it was. I launched it, I signed in, and I chose a district. It was good I felt all the nostalgic memories coming back to me and it felt good. Then I thought I should do a mission, I got into one and it started at this point I remember why I quit why I needed three new keyboards throughout one month and why I was such an angry gamer back then; this game just really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks.The match making is bad, very bad, its real life counterpart would be a coach that coaches children to play football then there first game they go and compete in the NFL. The game is very much a pay to win, unless you feel like dedicating two years of your life to grinding levels by getting wrecked by the same players over and over again to get a gun that will change your 0.06% of a kill to a 1% of a kill, youâre going to have to pay about 100$ (but even then there is still some one that will have payed up more than you). The physics are not as bad as they could be but are still very bad. The game does not seem to think that cars, players, and other movable objects should be affected by gravity. The physics are the only thing in this game that is broken but because it is broken it is good and worth a couple laughs.   Lastly the pit of what very well could be the worst game ever created: GamersFirst. Their name is nothing but irony because that is the last thing they do, in fact there name should be MoneyFirst because it precisely what they live for. GamersFirst has owned APB for 5 years now I think, and in those 5 years what have they done?  Fix the game engine? No!  Fix matchmaking? No!  Update game engine? No! Implement a better anti-cheat? No! Fix servers? No! Add new cars and weapons? Hell yes we have tons of those, but only for people that are willing to pay! GamersFirst have not added any free or upgraded content in the entire ownership in the game but instead will add content that is only those willing to pay 300$ for a new car. In fact the game is virtually the same game as it was when they bought it if you remove all the payed features.    My recommendation for this game? Donât waste your time, instead go try a good free to play game like War Thunder, TF2, or War Frame. The worst part about it is the fact that for new players APB is quite addicting and if you start you have a good chance to sink in a good hundred to buy you that shiny new thing you want, so just donât even start. 
6047	0	a	This game is horrible because there servers lag and there game lags for no reason with the best ping.There moderators are trolls i played the game for 3 hours then a moderator bans me permanantly for no apparent reason i didnt get and email of why i got banned i didnt do anything wrong.
3854	0	a	Plagued by hackers. FairFight in deffective. Fix the game.
6361	0	a	No, i do not reccomend this game. The game devs are germans so i thought they would sympathize with my character covered in swastikas, turns out they are not like that anymore. Pretty unfun when they perma banned me.
5751	0	a	Could be the best grand theft auto game ever if they didn't just want to make money, powerful weapons are only yours for a certain time then you have to rebuy them
5890	0	a	I actually really wanted to play this game when i figured out what it was kinda like gta the mmo till a downloaded it was so hard to set it up and when i did, it didn't even load then i started to find this game a peice of cow â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't get this game
721	1	a	After 10+ hours of Internet disconnecting, I got it. Bad graphics card. 10/10 hours.
6292	0	a	For those looking for a pay2win version of saints row 2, then APB is your goto. Otherwise just play GTAonline. Or keep moving along.
7626	0	a	Play this if you want to get screwed by hackers and people who payed for their guns. It's the perfect example of Free-2-Pay crap.
2061	1	a	Strong Recomendation!
786	1	a	It's like a GTA, but online.Visual very realistic and you can make tatooes,change cars and sounds.
5550	0	a	this is a bad game. buy gtav idiot.
5271	0	a	11/10 i will launch it again
9448	1	a	this pretty boring game some stupid story too but luckely this is free game!
8769	0	a	You see a lot of the cool ads and all of the cool character customizations... when you get into the game all you get is confusion with no tutorial (or I didn't get any) and the game is just bland and boring.
6368	0	a	I think I might have cancer.
2585	1	a	Pretty fun game, especially now for being free. Lots of customizing your character, even if you don't have premium membership. Lots and lots of mission variety, from kill the vip, to defend and take and hold. Plus even as a cop you can highjack people's cars. Decent variety of weapons, and the mission districts are pretty big. Overal a pretty fun game
2122	1	a	You Want a cool looking avatar you need to spen at least three hours on it. you want a cool car 5 hours plus some money. you want to win? you either give up your life savings or your whole life
5152	0	a	If you like playing one of the best games ever and they having it lagged server wide every 15 mins until you want punch out a dev, this is the game for you. I am literally the most calm person I know, and this games lagg issues â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off so hard I raise my voice and rage quit....... I NEVER rage quit and NEVER raise my voice. This game is literally making me a worse person. Gameplay is awesome, street fights are awesome, customization is UNREAL!! This sounds great until you lose 3 or 4 matches in a row because you are lagging for 1 min and 15 seconds you needed to tag a wall. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you devs, for making such an amazing game and then making it unplayable.
2019	1	a	A very fun game, full of hackers and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community. The former is being addressed very well by G1 and their 'FairFight' system. The latter is just there, as it is in any game. Amazing customization, and amazing gameplay. All unbalanced guns have been refined and it now feels as if this is a much better version of GTA Online. I definitely reccomend it. It's worth a try.
3404	1	a	Cool game for going all out against hordes of cops/criminals. Also, very good customization options, I recommend. 
4485	0	a	dont get it it yhas to downlaod punkbuster which nrver downloades
10191	1	a	So much fun from a well designed free to play game! Never thought they would be this good.
5091	0	a	This game sucks. I love this game. I hate this game. This game should have won game of the decade. thats how i feel when i play APB: Reloaded. It is absaloutly NOT new user friendly, but, its fun to just screw around, not even doing the missions. thats what i do. even though there are constant lag spikes, and the driving is really clunky, i love to screw around. some may also say this a a p2w, its is, then it isnt, its not like its all: BUY STUFF 2 WIN DIS MISSION UNLESS U WANT TO DIE 400000000000000 TIMES!!! its more like: you can buy this is u want, but you dont have to if you dont want to. i like that aspect. it also reminds me HEAVILY of the GTA series. overall, with some fixes, it could be a great game. 
3723	1	a	is this old? plz tell

8868	1	a	For SOME reason, my old and well viewed review for this game got removed and now i'll have to repost it:   OH MY GOD, how could i have played this crap for more than 170hours?   It seems like some people wanted Fallout New Vegas to be a MMORPG. And here it is. Well, one thing is for sure, it can be addictive if you like power play. It's art style is obviously some post apocaliptic stuff, wich looks not that bad itself. But seriously. this game is out since 2011 but yet it's full of gliches ,unfinnished animations and messed up or even missing sound files.That ruins the atmosphere.  But the thing that kept me playing for so long was the gameplay. First you start off with PAINTBALL GUNS AND SELF MADE SHIVES while rinding A FUKKING HORSE!. But then, you see some heavily armored guys with cool Gas-Masks and badass looking rifles, revolvers, and machetes while driving a dune buggy or a pocket bike(love em).  So.what does a power player think? 'I WANT THAT SH/T RIGHT NOW!' Then you realize how fast you can get EXP by just exploring and killing mobs wich acctaly makes really fun. (atleast at the lower levels.) Of course finnishing quests gives you WAY more exp than just killing stuff.But the thing is, most of the quests are not as repetitive as in the most MMORPGS.Well...not all of them are...let's say 50% of the quests you can get are repetitive.But that's something everybody who likes MMORPG's has to deal with.  Another thing is the crafting system.You can craft gear and equipment wich you could get from merchants and quest rewards 5-10 levels later.This includes....C@RZ!!!!!!!!!.you can craft your own ATV (wich is some sort of quad-bike) really early in game...if you do the right quest line.  The AI is....well...not that good acctualy.If an enemy detects you in it's view (wich is 360Â°...) it will follow you untill it's close enough to attack. If you run away from it it might give up the pursuit after like 8seconds.Usual stuff.  BUT it's the way they follow you....you can't hide from then.THEY CAN TELEPORT!  Example: I was in a house sniping out of a window. I shot some ugly a$$ mutant who was standing outsite and doing...well nothing.I shot him and took about 20% of his health.Then i wanted to swich to my shotgun and wait for him to get into the house so i can shoot him from upstairs.but while i was swiching weapons: GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR. It was RIGHT INFRONT OF MY FACE.So yeah, teleportation.This sucks.  But i must say this game got a LOAD of different enemies from Aligators to Zombies(and humans of course).Seriously a sh/t load. But sometimes....i though to myself 'why in a game like this?' Im talking about animals....NORMAL A$$ ANIMALS like bears, pumas, wild dogs, rhinos,snakes,Zebras etc. It seems like they ran out of ideas and started taking models from zoo tycoon.  ANYWAY. This game if great if you are only about the essence of a MMORPG since it's full with content and customizable player skills. If you care about visual stuff like graphics, visual gliches and overall atmosphere then....GTFO-------&gt;  I'm not sure whether to recommend this game for everybody or not. If you're someone who likes MMORPGs, then go download it.  Um...yeah...that review is way too long and like 2 people are going to read it anyway.k thx bye  (Sorry if there is any wrong grammar, english is not my native language.)
9981	1	a	good, deep, and long playing game u cant get boring !!!!!!!!
2756	1	a	Great game. Loads of fun. It's like GTA but online. The amount of customization beats any game I've ever seen. Sadly, gameplay 100% competetive and ate up with cheaters. Aside from that, you will have tons of fun just hanging out with friends and designing your character, cars, clothes, tattoos, graffiti, and even music.
727	1	a	It's funny how Gamerslast spelled their name wrong
5979	0	a	This game is great, besides the fact that it won't even load...
7983	0	a	This game blows! Don't know where to start. No solid tutorial, just kinda of throws you in the action and has a little pop up telling you to do something, but without telling you how to do said item. Also while you're running around trying to figure out what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ your supposed to be doing. Players with far more experience are also in the same area trolling the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you. Game is definitly Pay-2-Win with the in-game store being packed full of more powerful guns and faster cars. Honestly not worth spending any real money on. Played for a couple of hours and uninstalled it. Best of luck to everyone who keeps playing but you won't be seeing me.
9979	0	a	All the makings of a great game in a not great game!  Oh well, at least I didn't pay for it.
9213	0	a	Fallen Earth is an excelent thought, but it has crapy controlles and graphics. They also did not put a lot of time on fixing glitches in the graphics.I would not recommend this to anyone that wants to have fun.
5372	0	a	I don't know why I have 72 hours on this game. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥?
3609	1	a	this is a mix of gta. cod. and nfs. its amazing. the bad stuff about it is that it has bad graphics and {sometimes} poor matchmaking. also HAX EVERYWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EM' IS RUNNING ehem...where was i? oh.   yeah.   the market place has some dank player made stuff.  BUT the apb official marketplace [the gc one] is just overpriced. all the REAL DANK stuff is p2w. i did it. [duh] well its not OP but it gives you a slight advantage.
7998	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
6341	0	a	Well, i Dont Know What To Say Anymore , Too many Swear Words!
7194	0	a	this game its truly cancer if you are mad enough to download this â¥â¥â¥â¥ better kill you than play this shitiest game ever so dont download this better play even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing LOL another â¥â¥â¥â¥ game

862	1	a	everybody is so butthurt becuse ftp has p2w but ofcourse they have it stupid if you make a free game and make so it doesnt have eny way to pay real money in it then wtf like you made aa game for millions and millions of dollars and then have no way to get payed for it you woudnt earn â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the game you spend millions of money making so next time you find a ftp game dont be so butthurt about pay to win
10655	1	a	Protip: GO FAST
2175	1	a	Unbelievable....  1. The graphics are Good, You can customize your cars and characters.  2. The gameplay is Super EPIC! You can choose Terrorist or Cops!  3. The FINAL... Its not just singleplayer missions and coop. Theres even PVP Missions!   THIS IS EPIC!! You should have this...
6732	0	a	I've been playing since the RTW Edition, the community on the current APB is terrible, hackers are a common problem on APB, and G1 refuses to do anything about it, the guns are unbalanced and it is extremely repetitive. Matchmaking is terrible, you are paired with people not even close to your skill level. G1 Keeps adding guns that are pay to win, and refuses to fix the coding and scripting errors that this game boasts. They say they are making a physics engine update, however that Is a huge lie, they are showing little evidence to prove it and they said it would take a few months to implement, it has been a year atleast now. Their moderators are terrible, the one I will use as a example, Tiggs. She is a power hungry, abusive, and flat out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ moderator, anyone with a opinion that differs from hers is banned, and if you have a question she uses her mother mentality of 'Because I said so.' Many people I know have filed reports to the better buisness bureau due to apbs incapability to help customers when they're money is taken from them and they dont recieve the product they pay for. G1 simply says its customer error and keeps your money.
2812	1	a	Wont Start what to do?!
9911	1	a	i [played this for a while it was very fun in a fallout 3 kinda way, however if you do not like faction systems or pvp than this is not the game for you. Its like Fallout, Meets Guild Wars, i guees to most accurately describe it.
10751	1	a	Should you play this game? Yes. Think TF2 quality but faster. EPICSAUCE!!!!!
3829	0	a	i'll rather have a wank to susan boyle's pictures using sandpaper than to play this again.
10356	1	a	it would be nice to know when you make your account your user name with out having to research it. kind of pointless making you use a username as a password if you dont know it because the game company made one for you and didnt tell you it. learning this was stupid on the game developers part.
1661	1	a	Best game ever 9/11 unforgettable if you thought dota was a good game w8 till you get your hands on this
9334	1	a	Please make Russian language 
9423	1	a	It's a really fun game and it's kind of like fallout because you can roam around and collect items 
2573	1	a	Great game if you can put up with the lag and occasional bull poop moment... has improved slightly over the years but they wont fix the servers for some reason...
8931	1	a	Want fallout but cant buy it? Here ya go
3905	0	a	This game goes the extra mile for making everyone unique if you're willing to pay some money. That's not bad, but the actual game is. Controls are awkward and the sandbox maps feel grand at first but after exploring for a small amount of time I was already back where I had started. Aiming always feels off, and you have to focus way too much on it if you want to kill someone far away or not injured at all. Missions in sandbox mode are not always fair since they could match you with someone 4 times your level. This game could've been great but the gameplay and controls are sketchy and cars suck too. If you're bored on a weekend, try it, but if you're looking for a Saints Row here you are not going to find it at all. Three out of Ten.
6431	0	a	literally worst game i played in my life, i believe that if you play this game you should reconsider your life. driving with cars was pretty fun tho  2/10
9914	1	a	This is alot like fallout new vages i think that is what they call it but this is a very good multiplayer game and a RPG game.I recommend this to people who like multiplayer games or RPG (role playing games) then i recommend this game.
9181	0	a	Not worth your time just an endless grindfest with lacking animations, combat and mondane quest sytem. 1/10
4628	0	a	The perfect definition of P2W. It's a great example of what to avoid, it isn't a terrible game...that being said I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend I wouldn't want to put them towards the toxicity this game's community offers on a daily basis or the frustrations that would be had with this game. Devs are still behind their promised much needed engine re-work and the community is shrinking more and more each week.
1601	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!
8449	0	a	i liked how this game looked and all and the cars were awesome its really like GTA exept its glitchy as fk like sometime u cant see yack caus of dat glitch and gawd dam the lag is real here i got me a nice 64bit pc and its fast as fk but i cant really play this game to its full potential but hey if u got some crazy fast pc then u can play is with ease
9925	1	a	only made it to lvl ten, but so far it is a fun game to play. Plus its free can't beat that.
6132	0	a	This game sucks
6829	0	a	i thought it would be fun, but when i get a gun with the money you can get ingame easy and take all of it to own a gun that i can keep for 1 week but to keep it for good i have to pay real money thats just bad. the customization is decent but you need a membership thing. the openworld is horrible, theres no penalty for killing people like a cop chase or even getting money for killing people. the map is full of nothing, and playing as a cop is the same as playing as a crook, you can rob random civs for money and everyone avoids everyone exept the people who pay real money for better guns and cars, they just pick on you until you quit. save your time and dont put this in your library
7269	0	a	LOL! Surprised this game is around still.. Its like the only people who play it are either fanboys or tryhards.
7320	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
4973	0	a	this game is frustrating because for some reason i cannot close it
5670	0	a	Has the worst driving controls in the game and is really crappy yet seems interesting, but the driving feels like trying to turn away from hitting trees in a forest.
5215	0	a	you mightaswell crack yourself over the head with a cricket bat then play this squirming pile of baked â¥â¥â¥â¥
2066	1	a	The best free to play game on steam. Very fun if you like open world GTA style third person shooters.
1857	1	a	One of the best games ever made !! 
8055	0	a	The game on Steam is not the current copy of the game, so you have to spend extra time updating it inside of an application that launches the game itself. Then theres 6 splash screens, which aren't skippable. The game window does not fullscreen or even window properly, and does not lock the cusor.   The game then demands you to make an account on the publisher's website, and refuses to use a standard Steam login without linking it.   There are hackers absolutely everywhere you look, and they arent the subtle 'twitch to the head for a headshot' or a slight speedhack, im talking about them flying and jumping all over the place 1 shotting everything. What makes matters worse is that the premium players have weapons that mimic the hacker's weapons insanely well, so its often times impossible to spot an actual hacker until the blast off into the sky.  Naturally with all 'free to play' games, you can buy premium currancy that is often times required to actually progress further without spending day and days of your time just to get a slightly better machine pistol.  The only good side to this game is the car customization. Its a bit wonky, but it has more customization options than any other game that I've seen.   All and all: Disappointing buggy mess that the devs do not seem to care much about past making money from users.
7395	0	a	Okay,at first i kinda liked it but suddently i was doing a mission with the starter guns and they aren't half bad,real ammount of bullets for its real version is really close exept the snipers and M4s just 1 shotting every car in the game: gun balance extremely bad i get dominated by five-sevens  do not reccomend this game to anyone (exept hackers)
111	1	a	All Points Hackerchet: The Reckoning
7413	0	a	WTF IS THIS GAME ITS PAY TO WIN HARD TO SHOOT HARD TO DRIVE LIKE OMG THIS GAMWE IS SDHITTY I SUGGEST YOU DONT EVEN MOVE YOUR MOUSE NEAR THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOWNLOAD BUTTON IF YOU CLICK IT IT WILL DOWNLOAD A CANCER GAME 
5121	0	a	  What I liked about the game: There was nothing enojyable about this game. Apart from the Exit game button.  What I disliked about the game: Horrible graphics poor skin textures even on max settings. The mechanics of driving is not nice at all. The PVP matching is totally unfair for new players. Character animations are not aesthetically pleasing. I could go on, but I won't.  Personally I cannot recomended this game. 
561	1	a	This game good but there so maney cheaters that destroy the fun of the game !!!!
9564	1	a	Best shanking simulator there is

2250	1	a	44
905	1	a	The best part of this game is the button that allows you to uninstall it :D
1298	1	a	basically the free version of gta 5 and sort of gta 4 with no campaign mode and only multiplayer. The fact that it's free is amazing!, and you get the choice to be a police or a bad guy, unlike gta Overall. I really liked this game and the fact that its free is baws, so i rate it 9.5/10
4012	0	a	Why do people enjoy this game? What qualities of this game are attractive in any way, shape, or form? I want to know. I really do.
9834	0	a	I did not get to play the game, since the game kept freezing about 10 seconds after my character started moving, I could stand in one spot for up to 5 minutes, which is the most amout of time I was willing to wait, and then the game would freeze after a few steps.  Hard to review a game that won't work properly.. and before anybody says anything, yes, I did try using the launcher fix tool, I went as far as uninstalling and downloading again.. just to be met by the same error.  So yes, it could be my computer, but then, I can play other games without them crashing every few seconds, so maybe it's not all on my side.
2471	1	a	if you dont care about hacker and if you dont rage at this game you are not human
6627	0	a	The graphics were absolutely terrible
3109	1	a	Basically GTA f2p
2927	1	a	Not a bad game when your playing with friends and are looking for a laugh. Major Hacking Issues though. Store Hacked Items, Aimbots, etc.
5846	0	a	Its just not fun for poor people. If you\'re rich af, try this, but people who dont want to spend much beware of this game. It will try to suck you dry of your money, because anything good in this game requires real money.
10505	1	a	Welcome back to the awesomeness that is Tribes: Ascend. It took a couple years, and some really bad mistakes, but Hi-Rez seems to be turning things around. I definitely recommend trying this out if you never have yet, and coming back if you used to play.
5541	0	a	I have been to funerals more fun than this
1387	1	a	I WOULD IF I HAD AN ACCOUNT WITH HIGH RANK ! :/

4007	0	a	This game is cancer.
6051	0	a	What a clunky, frustrating, and really boring game. Since the game began, there have only been 2 core city maps. Decent sizes but full of really boring and useless things to do. So you do missions endlessly. Now to the game's credit, when you get two teams who are equally balanced and moderately competent, it can be fun. Those moments reminded me of Saints Row 2 multiplayer (RIP). But the method to aquire clothing and guns is such a disgusting grind of blah. The car physics and driving camera are both awful to deal with. The guns are not balanced in the least. The power levels of players and matchmaking is not balanced in the least. Newbs can expect to be the whipping boy for anyone with a decent modded weapon, abilities, and upgrades. THose players get the same for killing a weak newbs as they do an equally matched player... so who do you think they go after all the time? No wonder the game died. There is zero evidence of any kind of non-cosmetic content since launch. The game allows rampant abuses, and creates them with a lack of proper matchmaking, leveled areas, or any mechanism to balance the game in any way.  Go play GTA5 multi... it's vastly superior. APB was an ok idea that set the bar really low for itself and didnt do anything to raise it. The game is still kind of active but new players were constantly being discouraged and leaving due to the buzzards who quite obviously flaunted their unfair advantages at every turn.  Oh wait... APB doesnt care. If you want to actually not get wrecked and not spend 6 months grinding incredibly stupid unlocks you give them money. It's free toplay. No surprises. But it's been out for 8 years. And the level of content available is so insanly limited... oh wait no there are a ton of clothing and ca options if you want to grind it out or pay up... but the gameplayu is still lame, shallow, and lacking any kind of meaningful substance. It blows.  So if you think it looks kind of fun, it can be for a little while until you see all the things that are wrong with it. Then you will wake up and say 'Why am I wasting my time with this when it's 2016 and there are vastly superior but similar experiences to have?'
7483	0	a	Gets boring real easily. Customizations to your character and vehicles are extremely expensive, and you get killed a lot!
10541	1	a	This game realy awesome! Specialy when you are playing with friends! But i don't have friends to play with... So i playing with random human beans... beans i mean real beans greens and tasty good... so i realy love this game !
8381	0	a	An empty shell of my favorite game. Overrun by hackers and bots.
828	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON THE PLANET. WHEN I'M NOT SURE MY 'F' KEY IS WORKING I ALWAYS LOAD UP MY FAVORITE TESTING PLATFORM, APB. WHEN LIFE IS GREAT AND I NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN A BIT I ENJOY A GAME FULL OF PAY TO WIN, EXPLOITING, AND BUILT-IN ANTI FUN MECHANICS THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MOUSE OUT THE WINDOW BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.  10/10.
10768	1	a	I think game had great potential and it is a real shame that the creators completely abandoned the community and basically the game. Thanks to those of you who remain strong.
5544	0	a	GTA for poor people  Pros -... -Riddled with hackers yet not as many as GTA V currently has?  Cons -Pay to win -Extremely boring -Toxic community -Only way to make the real cash is by either paying for it or by playing a hundred PvP missions, or a thousand PvE missions, it's like you're getting punished for not wanting to play against other players, which is extremely dull. -All the cars are basically one big hitbox, you can't shoot people through car windows and the top speed is basically the same for all vehicles. And if you want to customize your character or vehicles to a higher extent you need to pay real money for PREMIUM.  To sum it up. It's dull as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1238	1	a	This game can get you raged as all hell, and yet once your hooked you'll keep coming back..  If you find the good side of the community, make a few friends, and get built up a little bit you'll love it.
5998	0	a	dose not work when you push start it dose not start.
8298	0	a	This a great game, but the community sucks... And the Support don't care about you just care about your pocket if you have money they will accept it, but if you need help they will just ignore you or say that they can't do nothing for you. So that's why I don't like this game, but I'm already addicted, I'm getting cancer and bla bla... So for your life if you want to be happy and get a family one day don't play this game.

315	1	a	Really great but HARD game, you have to play a hundred hours to be really good and enjoy the game.
3441	1	a	I got this game before i had steam so i have about 1000+ hours. This game is somewhat pay to win but then again you can reach almost everything without paying. The physics engine might not be the greatest but boy you can have a lot of fun with it. 10/10 would stunt again.
1565	1	a	:)
5731	0	a	Doesn't work, can't play for the servers is down, shouldn't be on steam if it requires constant connection to a server!
934	1	a	Great game and its a little pay to win but once you level up a bit and understand the gunplay the pay to win aspect of the game is gone and the amount of custimization is out of this world insane. I love the game and could not recomend it more.
3012	1	a	I've played first version of APB( with subscription like for one month or so) and it was poorer than this. Wow! Awesome FPS with open map. It's like GTA but smaller. I like whole 'in game'system and shoping. This game has only one defect - frustration when someone kills you! ahh
4711	0	a	Overall 5/10  keep in mind this may improve over time but as of now its not a good game. The base layer ishre for a great game, an open wrord Grand Theft Auto type climate. However soon after you start it bogs you down. The tutorial is terrible and while optional stays on screen till you complete it all(which is very hard. The biggest issues are the driving and shooting mechanices. They are terrible! The fun you have in this game goes away once combat starts. You often will die wihout seeing your enemy or become frustrated with how many imes yu have to hit your enemy for them to die. From far away they will simple run o cover. Up clsoeand the targeting system(or lack their of) and zoom make it exteremly difficult to kill someone. If your super sneaky you'll go far.  Again this could improve depending on changes
5915	0	a	This game is just OK.  Character customization is fantastic. Car customization is fantastic.  But thats about it. The game itself is full of hackers, and that ruins the actual gameplay. So if you love character/car customization, and dont mind getting pwnd by trolls check  this game out.

3496	1	a	Ignore all these scrubs with 10,00000000000000000000 hours obviously the game is great if they been playing the game for that long i only have about 80+ hours but here is what i think, This game is great because there is so much stuff to do! imagine GTA except you decide if you want to help the city or gun it down. sure its a little buggy, graphics arent great but HEY the game is free what do expect? for those who havent played it yet give it a try i promise it will be a fun game and even better with friends! just come and play the game with low-medium expectations.
9106	1	a	This game it cool and if you like post-apocalyptic game this is for you i playd it and i like it  have a nice day playing :3
3398	1	a	Played with a buddy of mine for about an hour or so, it was very fun flanking camper VIPs and killing them one by one until the game asked us to go after people carrying drugs and we got seperated. Didn't see or notice any hackers, but almost everyone was playing together with their friends so not suggesting playing this alone. It's a free game, don't have high expectations but it's good enough to waste a few hours now and then with your friends.  Here's a gameplay video for you;          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Being Bad at: APB Reloaded | This is our trash! | BurasÄ± bizim Ã§Ã¶plÃ¼ÄÃ¼mÃ¼z!&nbsp;
6531	0	a	The game altogether is good but they need to put in stamina and jumps should use it, because all the enforcers do is jump and sprint side to side so you cant hit them. And another reason you cant hit them is horribly broken hit box. Then when they are in range they just tase you then handcuff you. Then when they taser is recharcing or somthing they jump around and shoot like a mad man while you are trying to keep it realistic and you pump 20 shells in to there No good-low lying-bottom feeding-dirt eating-crap sandwichs, they pump 2 shells into you with an OP gun and kill you. And everyone either does this or snipes. Thats what you get with this Crap-sandwich with no bread game!

1247	1	a	Amazing game.Amazing replay value.Amazing customization and really strategic game. It's amazing that it rewards players for working in team instead of forcing them to go on their own.
2193	1	a	OMG I Love this game. Best game. Just like GTA
4944	0	a	would be amazing if they fixed it.... great game, i bought it twice at first, thats like 40$ before it came to steam
4264	0	a	People give this game a bad review for the wrong reasons. The reason this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ is the fact that everyone has fixed hitbox and no mater where you hit them on their body you are going to do the same amount of damage. This means that the combat just comes down to rock paper scissors.
9869	1	a	cool and addicting game that is basically free if you want to blow several hours a day playing -- this is the game if you don't have hours of time to spend goofing off--DO NOT DOWN LOAD THIS
6914	0	a	Absolutly the worst match making system I've ever seen on ANYTHING, me and my friends just constantly going back and forth between gold and silver while really low level facing level 100+ enemies with pay to win guns on gold and losing and facing what feel like noobs in silver then going back to gold again, gameplay wise it's not too bad but it's unplayable when you're matched up against completely uneven odds... I'd say 5/10 if they improve the match making (which I seriously doubt since it hasn't changed for the past 5 years) I refuse to rate it any higher
4491	0	a	i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)
1962	1	a	Its free you can steal cars and shoot people!
6718	0	a	ruined game/10     it's not   Ghosts   .... I mean this is worst than Ghosts     And that is sayin somthin
5832	0	a	the pay to win element is cancer
7864	0	a	I wouldn't rcommend this game to anyone due to the incriminating fact that it takes atleast an hour to setup your character and it hard to navigate through the selection screenes.

2621	1	a	its amazing  
10275	1	a	Like a Fallout New Vegas MMORPG, the creators of this game are genius! So much to do, so much to see and so many items to get, this game is one of the most addictive things ive ever played
5607	0	a	Was a great game back when it was not yet taken over by gamersfirst (more like payers first). This game ot self is amazing if you dont mind paying. Cause this game is pay to win to its max. If you dont pay you will, even if you are very skiled, lose. The weapons bought with cash ar way more powerfull then any weapon getabletrough playing. Its sad to see this game like this cause i have played from closed beta until and even sometime when it went free to play.
3669	1	a	While this game may be somewhat of a drag on your system, if your specs can overcome the hurdle it may possess, it is one hell of a shootin', lootin' team makin' FPSMMORPGRTS. 7/10

951	1	a	after 28h of playing i can recomend the game to everyone.It may not have the best physics o graphics but i dont know bout the others buti found the community very good.You can pretty much ask anywhere for help and when you first log into the game you'll be welcome from everyone and the tutorial is very effective too.The game concept is good the side missions are fun the optimization might not be perfect but it is good enough for low-end machines.Customization is amazingly awesome.To sum up this game is a gta v but free and with worse graphics and physics

4356	0	a	Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.  Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.
4706	0	a	Just another p2w full of cheaters shooter... get away from this
1127	1	a	I didn't play much of it, it's okay I guess
8502	0	a	So APB has had a rocky road. Real Time Worlds was the first company to develop and make APB. However, the game was plagued with issues. From talk of supposed ex employes, the game was rushed out for lack of funds. Some employees cam out and posted concept art and plans for what they wanted to do with the game but couldn't because lack of funds. It sounds amazing.  So you had this game come out and it was horrible. The optimization was in a horrid state. Griefing and hackers everywhere. Horrible progression system. Some horrible missions. General horrible map design. To top it off...it cost 15$ a month to play.  Needless to say, it failed. It went under. RTW went out of business (hence the in memorium at the start of the game). The game I think lasted like 2 months? G1st bought them up later in 2010.   Sadly...they've done nothing with it. Lets go over the major changes they've made to the game.  1. New Anti-hack system - this helped with the hackers, but there will always be hackers in the game. Its in a much better state, but as a f2p game...you know how it goes.   2. Fightclub - Essentially they took parts of the pre existing map, put up barriers around it, put it into its own instance, then threw 12v12 battles into it over certain objectives. Not really adding anything. Mainly just...re-arranging stuff.   3. Joker Tickets - a special currency from fight club. I will say that they did add in quite a few items to be used with joker tickets.  4. Cash Shop Introduction  5. Numerous cash shop guns  6. Numerous cash shop clothing  7. Numerous cash shop cars/kits  8. Festival events that often have a heavy cash shop undertone   9. New 'end game' NPC that sells new clothing/gear  10. New equipment/consumables  11. Performance fixes/bug fixes/optimization  12. Removal of 'bad' missions and poor designed missions  13. A 'better' matchmaking system  So over the past 6 years, those are the major things that have been accomplished. As you can see, they didn't really add anything into the game. The major things that can be considered additions are the cash shop related stuff, one NPC that is at the very end, better anti hacker, and their gear, and joker tickets gear. Fightclub wasn't really an addition since they're basically just copy and pasting pre-existing code and blocking off a section of a map that is already there. The asylum is a special fight club only map, but even that is rumored to not be made by g1st. Apparently it already existed in the game files but wasn't quite ready for released. I think it took them like 3-4 years to released it.   Now there are problems that existed in the game with RTW...that still exist.   1. Matchmaking. It's horrible. See there are two things in the game. You have a threat level and a rank level. Now I think the max rank is 255. Rank is required to use some gear and generally tells you how long a player has been playing. Imagine this being like levels in a standard MMORPG. Higher ranks have access to more gear, equipment, upgrades, cars, etc. Threat level tells you how 'good' you are. You go from trainie, green, bronze, silver, gold. It's insanely easy to get gold if you're even moderately good. So how does the MM work? It only takes into account threat level. So I've been in situations where you have a rank 50-110 with low level gear going up against a highly geared 255 rank in gold districts. Heck, even silver districts have this issue. It doesn't end there.  Now this game has districts. Districts are split by threat level. Gold can join gold and silver districts. Silver can join (I think) gold, silver, and bronze. Bronze can join silver, bronze, and green. A gold can't join a bronze district for example. What people do is intentionally lose games to lower their threat level to join lower districts. I just had a fight where you me and one other silver and a traine going up against two rank 150+ gold players in a bronze district.    http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/391733-matchmaking-at-its-best/   That's a good indicator at how bad the MM is at its current state. Even with their attempts to fix it.   2. Horrible Map Design. They never really tried to fix some of the map issues. In terms of a shooter, it's still bad. Full of choke points, campable areas, and just general frustration. There are freeways in the game and they're what they sound like...big open freeways. People love to get snipers and sit on them because they're insanely hard to take out since you have to find a ramp and hope you can make it to the sniper before he shoots you as you drive across a big open area.   3. Edge of p2w. Right now the game is basically 'pay money for good gear now'. Most of the guns/weapons you can get in game. Personally I consider 'pay real money now or spend 30+ hours working towards the same gun' to be p2w.   4. Progression is slow. You need to progress roles and contacts to get certain gear. Some gear like upgrades require you to use a weapon to unlock upgrades for it. So if you want to get a certain upgrade for your assault rifle, you've got to use your assault rifle a ton. So if you're in a gold district there's a chance you'll be fighting highly customized weapons with a unmodded weapon. It's very frustrating.  5. Horrible Mission Design. So the only thing they touched with the mission system is taking out missions. Sadly, they can't take them out (that would mean they have to make more). There are still horrible ones. Two off the top of my head. One is called VIP. A player on one team is selected to be VIP and everyone in the game can see the big VIP marker from anywhere on the map. Through walls, etc. Basically taking out any sort of stealth strategy for one team. The VIP has a set amount of lives and the attacking team has a set amount of lives. Putting the entire games success on the hands of one individual that may or may not be horrible (and is handicapped with a 'wallhack' so to speak) is very frustating. I hate being the VIP. It's not fun. Another one is where each team gets a big marker above the head of each member and a set amount of lives for the team. Basically a TDM. Again, no stealth. The amount of times I've seen people standing behind walls looking at one another with third person view waiting for the other to move is a ton. Or they all go to some insanely easy campable area only counterable with a nade launcher (which is like an endgame, last unlocked weapon). Or worse, they get enough kills to be considered 'winning' and then they run around the map running the clock.   6. Optimzation issues. Still huge FPS drops randomly. I think it has something to do with the gun smoke. I can run Gw2, GTA V, planetside 2, elite dangerous, etc etc. However, I still get horrible FPS drops in this game. Apparently they're making a new renderer which I hope will help the game. It's very frustrating to get into a firefight and have your FPS Drop to like 2-5 randomly in the middle of it.   7. Spawning. Spawning in both Fightclub and the vanilla mode is horrible. For example on the VIP thing. The amount of times I've been spawned in road right in the sights of an enemy sniper is a lot. Or wayyy far away from any team members and closer to enemies. Today I was playing fightclub capturing a point and TWO enemies spawned next to the point and killed me. So lame.   The major reason that this game is pulling the numbers it does (peaks at around 2300 right now) is because there's no other game like it. GTA V did put a dent in the population. APB averaged around 2100 players the same month as GTA V release and some months before that. After it released it has been dropping till what it is now...averaging 1400 player. If they actually did something with this game in the 6 years they've owned it, I'd recommend it. Right now it seems like they're putting forth minimal effot to keep it alive and makin money. Maybe they've spent all this time prepping it for console release
5286	0	a	The most Imbalanced broken game out there, in allmost all ways possible, includeing bugs and hacking.. Stay away forever.

3059	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very nice game to play with friends to experience the fun of the game to the fullest! I highly recommend this game if you want to experience what GTA online would be like! You and your friends might enjoy it!
8814	0	a	I did a previous review explaining why this was still a good game and delved into the issues with hackers and defended this company and game full heartedly. I then got false banned for 'hacking' under the new FairFight anticheat system, along with many others.   This was just another slap in the face by the ironically named 'Gamers First' company. Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken. This is not okay and this company is scamming players.
7319	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
8137	0	a	Only thing I LOVE about this game is the custome tatoos, shirts, and cars, however, in order to gain full access to customization tools, you need to pay real money to unlock more layers...wtf! That is just a bumer for me, still manage to get some nice logos done. After the customization side of this game, it's pretty bad. It's pretty much GTA Online for F2P. It's call F2P, but those who spent real cash has a giant advantage over those who don't. Good weapons are all really high rank and requires a lot of grinding to get. This game is not beginner friendly at all.

9329	0	a	This game... This game is one of those game that you enjoy uninstalling more then playing the actual game and that is because of various reasons: 1. The game is no longer supported. 2. The game is very buggy and glitchy. 3. Only fun when getting really far through it. 4. Crashing non stop. 5. Srsly why am i keeping reviewing it like few years after it got out, we all know it sucks.
5911	0	a	Its a heavy pay 2 win. Sucks now.
6600	0	a	When the game finished downloading I couldnt wait to play it. But i was so dissapoited by the graphics and gameplay and servers ! Its fun for 1 hour or stuff ... and u cant compare this with gta !!!
4138	0	a	A failed uptopia, from its citizens to its infrastructure.  I love this game, and I may sometimes hop on, but I cannot in good conscience honestly recommend it.  +++PROS+++ The basic idea is wonderful. It's an open world city with customized characters pitting cops vs robbers for strategic operations and car chases.   This game is known for its vast customization. The Player Characters' bodies are customizable, tattoo-able, clothing customizable, cars customizable, theme songs, equipment, weapons.   The style of the non-player content is very attractive, a motion graphic setting a metropolis plagued by stylish punks; even the corporate executives are stylish.   If you're bored of killing, you can spend hours customizing or you can scrape some money up robbing places, catching robbers, stealing and returning cars. There are other things to do than missions.  It is not a pay to win game. Paying players will have some advantage, but it's really not a problem.  I'm going to go ahead and put the game's city in the Pros section. The cities do feel half alive. When I'm in the game, I feel like I'm in a city, not a backdrop of buildings, as I felt in Borderlands. There are plenty of stores, shops, apartments, places cities would need, and civilians walking around. The civilians are walking talking dolls that interact minimally, but it is just barely enough to make the city feel alive as I'm cruising in my car, looking at these 'civilians.' I do, however, wish the player contacts would interact with players more; they truly are cardboard cutouts, even with some of their dialogue.  ---CONS--- The game runs horribly. I'm no tech wizard, and I do have an old laptop, but for a game of this age with this level of texture and model quality, it's odd that I'm lucky if I can get any steady 10-15 frame rate at all.   This game is not especially well designed for the strategic action that was intended.  The levels are not perfectly balanced. There are only two city districts to play missions in, the main content of the game. The mission objectives are often in siege points of cqc mazes, surrounded by vast open areas; the enemy can see you coming from any direction, especially if they know the game's spawn points and routes well, and even if you manage to close the distance, they'll be waiting for you with cqc weapons ready. There aren't a lot of ways to flush enemies out of a siege position, other than being high leveled and affording grenade launchers.  The game's action is fast; characters are pretty zippy, compared to real life anyway. So, like Counter-Strike, this game gives strong favor to physical skills, reflexes and aim. Strategy and brainpower can help greatly, but a player can more easily brute force their way and kill enemies from disadvantaged terrain than they could in Ghost Recon Phantoms or even TF2.   Cover is used in this game minimally, you're obviously better off behind cover than in the open, the game does not really encourage strong use of cover. Cover is generally only provided in those cluttered maze like cqc areas. On the street, there is no cover except for exploding cars that do not protect your feet. In cqc areas, cover is less used because the fights are dances between two players with fully exposed hitboxes. There are short time limits on the missions, so players cannot wait around too long, especially if a fast moving enemy is patrolling the area. Once you get into cover to face an enemy at range, there's not a lot you can do to leave cover, as there is not a web of cover to leapfrog to and you don't have a lot of grenades and you don't have time for the coordination required for suppressive fire.  Teamwork is needed, but not really emphasized. Because of the low team sizes, teams are better off splitting up to attack from multiple angles. Being so far away from each other, players tend to act on their own; the only way to coordinate a team adequately is with a microphone; there is nothing to rally players together. Players do not need each other as all players have just about the same abilities; this is not TF2, where classes have strengths and weaknesses and are rallied by a medic.  The matchmaking is horrid. The game sets up some pretty unfair matches. Part of this is due to the low population, which is no doubt thanks to the game's problems and lack of aid to new players. And as you climb the ladder in skill, you will eventually find yourself constantly losing against the players at the top of the ladder, who never lose; they are lethal at all distances with an assault rifle and have the money to spam missiles and grenade launchers if they want to.   You win some you lose some, but all these things add up for too many moments where you'll have to learn the humility to surrender, knowing there was nothing you could do. Or if you do finally kill the guy who has been killing you over and over again, it was because of the luck of the aim rather than you being smarter. You just keep throwing yourself like water at a stone.   The community is horrid.   There are a lot of cheaters.  The game is an MMO. MMO's must constantly release new content until they eventually die out. This game is in its old age and it's handled by a small team that cannot release new content as often as needed. Even if they did, it wouldn't fix the base problems of the game.
7734	0	a	This online game look like GTA.In fact,the gane just killing each other in a open world city.It's also buggy and boring.  Windroid's Recommend Score : 58/100
3887	0	a	This game sucks. You basically have to hack to get kills. Movement is glitchy and to nerfed to even play. If you are a F2P don't bother, all the people who have stuff are already better then you, forcing you to get the DLCs. Don't play this game.
961	1	a	Well seeing as how this game's complicated to a fault, ONLY has an awkward 'over the shoulder' camera view that I can't stand, the freeroam is day or night always full of spawn campers &amp; high level cops who either kill you or bust you every 5 secs... (WHY? because the X-box 360 won't map to the stick for stuff like turn left or right in driving mode in your car, amoung other control mapping issues on foot ect. it's not even entirely clear about if the zones [beside the social 1 where nobody shoots you &amp; you can edit your char ect.] are or are not PVP on all the time, who wants to die 10,000 times while struggling to grind a brand new char in areasd full of level capped toons with an inferiority complex... crimecraft was more fun then this @ lower levels. do_Ob
6999	0	a	First impression bit sloppy Guide Player Base Seems like League of Legends Kids start screaming and flaming the moment it aint going in their favor and come up with petty insults overal the game's garbage
9172	0	a	bullet sponge yet boring enemies+boring world+boring story+extremely small variety of everything+terribly done shooter= Terrible game! would not consider paying for/10 literally a 0/10, would not play again.
3317	1	a	Fun game. Reminds me of GTA. It is one of my favorite Free-to-Play's on steam.
3977	0	a	pay to win with some of the biggest pay walls i have ever seen
7619	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was
975	1	a	The game is quite good if you have someone to play it with the vehicles are fun to drive gameplay is alright and the customization is awesome
5930	0	a	This game basically needs a bit of cash splashed onto it to work. its a good f2p game but, you need to pay money to get good guns to do good. using the in-game currency to buy perma-guns would be nice. This game handles itself strangely. pay like 35 in-game credits for a permanant clothing item but pay 1300 credits for a leased gun. The artwork that people post for this game looks nice.  A remake (or sequel) would be nice (if there was no need to pay real money). Hit detection can be S.H.I.T but if you pay like 100 usd to buy a SINGLE permanent gun you won't have a problem. And as RELOADED ENT. are money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s they sell in THE CASH SHOP leased guns. LIKE WTF. don't play until it gets made better.
9077	0	a	waste of time
2740	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
7804	0	a	i used to play this before it was free to play and now its free to play yeah right if you dont pay for good guns your going to have a bad time as every ones gun is better then yours you can shot them a lot they wont die they shot you 3 times your dead and its always with guns you buy with real money so unless you pay you wont play trust me
4763	0	a	if you want to get camping police that camp at your objective, get this game  if you want to get owned by a guy that absorbs your whole magazine and insta kills you with 3 or 4 bullets, get this game  if u want to suffer failing missions because of camping policemen, get this game  4/10, too many camping pigs  all serious though i love the idea of being a criminal or a cop and doing missions while being able to customise your person or vehicles in many different ways but you will have an extremely difficult time playing, exspecially if your a criminal as you will get policemen that are like 30 or more levels above you camping at the objective and ruining your day. at random times a special weapon will appear and who ever has it when the timer runs out then they get it. normally the weapon makes them unkillable like one time where a grenade launcher spawned and while he was busy firing at the enemies infront of him i sneaked up behind him and fired a whole clip into his head before having him turning at the speed of light and blowing me to bits. when you are doing missions (mainly if your playing as a criminal) you will get to the very last objecitve and just when u reach it 3 policemen will just join the mission and pretty much make the mission impossible to complete. if this game was more balanced and didn't have people who are complete bullet sponges then i wouldn't of have uninstalled this game. overall i would recommend u get this game if you want to play as a policeman but if you want to be a law breaking criminal mastermind then u got no chance.
1497	1	a	lots of boobies ( . Y . )
2311	1	a	Great game i would recommend to anyone
7518	0	a	I wish it was good, but it isn't. Cash shop driven, not enough content, cheaters EVERYWHERE. The theory is good, execution bad, and this will never change as developer is underpowered to fix it.
1302	1	a	I saw the reviews, I've played the game for quite a while now, And yes, I am still a silver, But the community isn't that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest thing that I saw was someone typing 'OMG NOOBS' in the chat once when we lost, but that's it..  Also, yes, the game IS P2W, but I didn't pay a single penny and I'm doing just as fine and enjoying the game.   This game is definitely a fun game, And you can enjoy playing this easily, even if it is P2W.   -The almighty Paban.
1316	1	a	Yes. but be prepared for certain pay to win aspects if the game, overall though great game
9535	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Not worth it. bye
3477	1	a	Have not played this game in quite some time but when I did, it was good. Anyone care to explain what happened and how they ruined it?
2672	1	a	the best
5712	0	a	It would probably be a bit better if this game wasn't a game where (paying) is not included casually
7979	0	a	Point of this game is? Sorry but no!
4149	0	a	Do i recommend this game to other players? no. why?  1.Match Making system is bad (Example: a player played the game for 50 hours can matched with a player who played 800 hours.  Another example if this game is like League of Legends, they are making bornze fight platinum or gold fights diamond)  2.hackers (Some top rank players can be hacker)  *3.They want money ( what i mean is that fix the game is not their primary, they made more things to buy and try to attract more players)  4.Bad performance(Server like waterfount is not stable, ping jumps from 50 to 500)  But if you want to know the good side of this game, here is what i found.  1.customize ( custom your clothes , your car , your music , or the troll music that the player gonna hear it after you kill them.)  2.you are playing with 100 people ( The idea of have a free world and your battles can be any where in the map is great and the missions can get effect by other players that have nothing to do with you is interesting, it makes you feel you are playing a lots of people not just a server with 10 people in it)  3.Freedom( There is more other then just doing missions,  you can play fight club if you don't feel like to finish a whole match, that you can quit any time you want and you will still get rewarded.  Or you just don't feel like you want to fight, you can just drive in the free world or you can go to social district talk to other people, looks at other people custom maybe get some new idea and use on your own, trade, make your self look more badass or cute, make some music etc)  4.Is a mixed game , it can cover a lot( Is a shooter game but is also a driving game, it can even be strategy game or a rpg, it have skills on character , guns , and cars . It have a lot to explore)  And that is the good side and the bad side of this the game. I would say if you do not have the patience then this game is not for you, the good stuff doesn't come if you can't pass it's dark side first . However if you have patience and are interest what it have to offer to you, you can try but no guaranteed you will get what you want.
6827	0	a	My complains -The game wont even start -idunno why but it â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my pc a little up -it always wants me to like on facebook  i now that i sould say the game is bad cus i didnt played it,but i cant even start it so what the â¥â¥â¥!?!?!
7267	0	a	I cant even get the game to load! the launcher has MANY, MANY problems that need fixing. even when I can get past the launcher the game wont load, so I dont really have any oppinion towards the game/gameplay but this game need alot of help. I also asked a friend how he got the game to work because i saw him playing it, but he replied with 'I havent even gotten it to work, ive just been stuck in the launcher trying to fix it'
3796	0	a	Its like cocaine, you know its terrible for you, but you still play it.
6988	0	a	Nope. This game has absolute potential, but new players are vulnerable to hackers and higher ranks with overpowered weapons. Don't waste your time installing this game, unless you want to get blown up by a pornstar with an RPG and rage over it. The only good thing about APB: Reloaded is the character customization. Not friendly to newcomers, you have to pay2win. Uninstalled immediately.
8623	0	a	game sucks don't download
4609	0	a	the game is bad optimized my computer nearly exploded NOW I HAVE 8GB RAM THIS IS WORST GAME ON STEAM EVER
3922	0	a	An extremely poor game, riddled with hackers and bugs. This game was originally a subscription based game run by an EA owned company, but they folded and RELOADED Productions picked this game up, hence the game being renamed to APB Reloaded. The European servers I can only describe as awful, with many experiencing critical lag spikes and rubber banding. Some experienced hackers even use methods to lag switch, increasing your ping- forcing you to stay in one place; while he/she can shoot you on the spot. The hacking in this game is awful, the game company are powerless to stop it, and they have refused to update the game's anti-hack engine to sort this out. To add to insult, it's considerably easier for Criminals to make more money than enforcers, and many people have an account on both, one low ranked criminal that farms money from ram raids, and one enforcer who's a high rank and gets given the money through another account.  THE GAME: Gameplay is of a basic F2P 3rd person shooter, overly average graphics, with below average gunplay (some sub machine guns kill in 5 hits, while an assault rifle in a bigger calibre may take 7, go figure). This game is extremely pay to win, with many locks put on the player as a F2P member. See all those awesome car decals? That player's got premium. So you got premium, you've made your car but it looks all pixely? That's their new decal system, to skimp on money they lowered the texture qualities so they didn't have to purchase more servers (confirmed from staff from inside source). Many of the buy with real money guns are overpowered as heck, killing in half the time of in-game cash guns, while also being more accurate and considerably faster to reload.  THE FORUMS: Don't use them. A nasty throwback to the past, and rife with overtly corrupt staff. There are many stories of people being banned for hacks, when they get unbanned for no reason by an Admin, the two suddenly emerge as best of friends, and anyone who argues is labelled a troll and silenced. Also, some of the moderators aren't even old enough to play the game, when they recruited Forum Mods they didn't check ages all too well, and I can name a few mods who aren't old enough to play the game, let enough be a member of staff. Finally, the banning system in this game (when it works) is highly flawed. A few people have been banned innocently, but the game company refuses to hear your quarrels, as it has a policy of not contacting people on banned accounts. Have fun watching all that money get sucked away!  VERDICT: Waste of memory, this game had so much potential under EA (something rarely said) but the company who created this went bankrupt, and RELOADED products sucks. Don't get the game, it's a waste of time and memory- with nearly 550 hours on it I should know. I'll give this game a rating of 2/10, with lag spikes and hacks breaking gameplay, with a poor out of game support system too.
8997	1	a	This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.
10163	1	a	If I had some friends who like MMOs - the real life would become just useless. The game is great!
6354	0	a	It's like GTA online for poor kids with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ computers
1289	1	a	Can't even register an account.   Best uninstaller simulator, 11/10 Would uninstall again!
4488	0	a	This game is absolute garbage. Unless of course you feel like spending your money to have an advantage over everyone...
3411	1	a	this is good game
10008	1	a	i can't login,so i can't get on to atually play someone please help. t
1511	1	a	Its a great game *cough* If you do the missions.
6454	0	a	This game is fun for the first few hours and has amazing options for character customization, but gameplay quickly becomes shallow and meaningless and has a very strong 'pay-to-win' feel. The anti-cheat security was terrible when I played the game and was a deciding factor in giving up on this title.
1441	1	a	Fantastic. It is basically GTA online but not GTA? Then get this!
1717	1	a	7/10 Love the game i really do, but i am a pretty competitive player and the pvp, is pretty rageful. I mean you can expect a free to play game to also be pay to win, they gotta make money somehow and honestly i would rather the game be $20 then to have people with OP weapons killing you extremely fast. Im glad there is a bronze silver and gold ranked pvp system but there are still the players with better weapons. Now instead of complaining about the cons i would like to lastly say THE CUSTOMIZING of this game is seriously amazing.(the pvp brought the game to a 7/10)
8885	1	a	I highly recommend Fallen Earth as a long time player I've seen this game go from greatness down to the mud and back again. The community is great and has a high loyal player base. No other game that I have ever played has brought me back to it as much as this one has. I see many negative reviews on this but if u notice their play time in game its less than 2hrs at most. Dont be fooled the game is even better with a low player count, it truly does give it that feeling of an apocalypse. Instead of running into someone every 2 secs considerably takes away the immersion of being a post apoclyptic game.   I highly recommend this game, Join Royal Bloodline a noob helping clan.
317	1	a	it was gta 5 online for a long time then gta 5 online came out
9715	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
5892	0	a	I would call this game Pay to Win. Argue if you want, but it's a multiplayer PVP game for the most part and you can buy cooldowns, permanent weapons ( some with exclusive mods, ) 2.25 times more cash gains etc...  You can buy pretty much everything permanently with real money right off the bat, be it cars, weapons, etc. If you want to be 100% Free to Play, be ready to spend tons of gold on 10-days lasting weapons. You will have to gather money for days to get one permanent weapon, only if someone is selling one on the Marketplace. The community is terrible, there's many bugs, random downtimes which cancel your missions and you lose the rewards you would have gotten for that misson. Also you can slaughter the whole city and be unnoticed, but be wary that breaking a store window by mistake, not even stealing anything and the other players playing enforcers can arrest you and steal all the money you have on you!  Also the matchmaking is terrible, sometimes you get matched with 2 other silvers and you have to face 3 golds. Your whole team could be rank 20 and you play against rank 200+ which have more mods, better cars, knows the game more and have better weapons. You have ''Bronze, Silver and Gold'' servers, but they're full of golds who like to pwn noobs either way. Only the leader can call for backup and people go AFK randomly pretty often.  Also, if your team leader ( which seems to be random because 90% of the time I join a mission I am not the leader, ) decides that he dosen't like you, he can kick you right before the mission ends to make you lose all the money and experience you would've gotten. He can also kick you just because you killed him by mistake, just because you sprayed a tag before him or even because you are MVP and he wants to be MVP instead!  The good? It's probably one of the only MMO that looks like GTA and Saints Row. The graphics are ok and the game has alot of content. Sadly, it's not a game I would play more than I already did after noticing all the flaws it has.  Here's the benefit of premium ( forums says it's 12.50$ per month: )  Around 90% bonus to all Contact XP gains. +125% bonus cash gain ( Instead of 500$ for a mission you would gain 1125$. ) 20% discount on the Armas Marketplace ( Real money marketplace. ) 50% shorter cooldown on abilities like Field supplier, Nitro booster, etc. ) Deeper Customization (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing items, 100 layers per Symbol. ) Removal of Subscription ADS ( which appears at the end of all missions. ) Armas Trials for weapons and vehicles last 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ( which makes using the 200~ trials, 6 times more effectively. )
2263	1	a	A really cool open world shoot them up and it's basiclly saints row the third mixed with E.A
6677	0	a	This is excatly what pay to win looks like. When Realtime worlds had this game it looked stunning and everyone was excited but once it was picked up by its new developer, everything went down hill. The first thing you'll notice is almost everything has a lease on it and the only way to keep you Weapon, car, etc is to pay real money which is absolutly ridculous. I can understand the developer need to make money off this game but this is not the way to do it.
10210	0	a	Trust me when I say this game is awful. It has terrible loading times and over all is a glitchy mess to play. And since it's a free to play game it is legally obligated to have microtransactions in it, and boy are there plenty.
4856	0	a	100% pay2win. Its very terrible and has too many confusing menus and just â¥â¥â¥â¥s up your eyes after playing for a couple horus .-.
3737	1	a	its a fun game you should play with friends. The driving is bad but its pretty fun
7659	0	a	This game is a laggy, confusing, pathetic excuse for a game. Do not waste bandwidth or hard drive space on this game. It's not worth it
5204	0	a	Super bad game. Do not waste your time to download it. TRUST ME!
9985	1	a	i recommend it. 1.) free. 2.) its fun and interesting. 3.) it gives you a fallout feel that will also get rid of all your fallout withdrawels. ok. so seriously. not pay to win/play/or even look. its free. feels wierd in a way but it also plays smoothly for jus about any pc. i personaly like this game. it reminds me of fallout 3 with a touch.

9624	1	a	a low meh.
6135	0	a	Why do I have 31 hours in this game? IT SUCKS! AND FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T STOP FEELING THE URGE TO PLAY IT MORE!!!
10463	1	a	This game is awesome! You get to craft items... don't want to ruin the surprise of what though.You complete quests all while trying to figure out your past!   *Update* I have begun playing this game again. While G1 did destroy some great elements of the game. This is still one heck of a game. I'm not one of those people who played this game for the PvP, I was one of those people playing by myself for the story and mainly just because I stunk at PvP :p The population of the game has died off tremendously, but the people in-game are helpful and kind. It's still a game to consider for a couple of pointless, fun hours. Heck, at the very least, download it. It's free, nothing to lose.
9003	1	a	If you don't have it, get it. 
9373	1	a	how do you make a account? 
5176	0	a	Its been a year since ive played this game. I installed the game wondering why I stopped in the first place. I instantly realized why I stopped playing it.   -Constantly micro-freezing on a computer better than the one I originally played it on in the past with no issues.  -Toxic community of hateful wads of sh!t.  -P2W system of weapons and skills.  -Hacking around every corner.  -Constantly being reminded by the game to buy things with real money, also opens up the marketplace for the game on start up, really subtle.  -Completely broken matchmaking system where brand new players are set up against seasoned veterans of the game.  -Hit detection is non-existent.  -You 'rent' weapons unless you cough up about $15-$70.  -And overall one of the worst experiences ive had with multiplayer games. ever.   and they somehow managed to make the game even worse over the course of 2 and a half years on top of having already been a steaming pile of crap after leaving the initial membership model of the original company.   We need an APB out on this game's current developers. Be sure to send the San Paro PD, with their OPGLs.

6907	0	a	This is the 9/11 of video games.
6818	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.

Please don't install this game.
3967	0	a	Mixed feelings about this game. If you've spent enough time on it, it's a great expereince. But if you're a little impatient, and don't like the very repetetive stuff, I would not recommend it.
1685	1	a	Cool game :)
4268	0	a	Tried this game a while back for the costumization and cops vs robbers theme. It has seriously an impressive costumization feature by any game. However it's more like terrorists vs terrorists than cops and robbers rp.   More importantly, this game is the worst case of pay to play in an mmo I have ever seen. Literally only stock gear and few cars and useless clothes (no armor) are reasonably obtainable without hashing out real $. So unless you plan on throwing your cash at this game to buy ridiculously overpriced in game items and costumization features, don't waste your time. Furthermore, the divide between players who don't pay to play and the pay to play ppl is bigger than the divide between the rich and poor in a corrupt dictatorship. And you have the major hacker problem. This game is the king of rage quit and bullsh**  Seriously, this is a game that had huge potential and went horribly wrong. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, OR SANITY ON IT
1891	1	a	i had lots of Fun in APB and i still have
3065	1	a	Good Game but only downside is you need a good computer to get alright fps. Some Servers are very small and you get to know alot of people good but really bad mission pairing. I give a 7/10.
6951	0	a	this game is full of hackers and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
10009	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)
4033	0	a	Banned for no reason. â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. would rate 0 if possible. Lost $600 USD.
2686	1	a	I know a lot of people who dismissed this game as a GtA knock off or a crappy fps. But some people don't dive to far enough into the game the see what it really is, the world of Chaos and Law. Now before you jump to conlclusions i was sceptical of the game as well at first, but it's one of those things that have what you would call a wind up period where people have to get used to the game and figure out what they have to do. That being said I tried it for a couple hours at a time at the start of my criminal career, but i soon found myself logging in more time over and over and over, until i felt like i got into the swing of things. At that point I had been playing solo but i had convinced a couple of friends to try the game and after i had showed them the ropes we got addicted to what we thought was the best part ...MULTIPLAYER... Multiplayer is what can make or break a game and for this game i say it made it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who might be a little lacking in the $$$ department or is just looking for a game that they can have fun with some friends.  8/10
6679	0	a	Cool customization and stuff. But it's probably the biggest steaming pile of garbage i've ever played. With the time i've played i've been plagued with lag and shots not registering... It also runs like â¥â¥â¥.
527	1	a	ItsÂ´acceptable
1562	1	a	Good Game for free 
7553	0	a	just another P2W, being a criminal in real life it's cheaper than this laggy game full of aimboter players, so go on and use those $10000 that you're paying for this game and use them for a real gun.
1482	1	a	i love this game and dont even mind paying for a car n a gun this kept me going while i awaited gta V for pc but the server lag is unbareable and near unaccepible for a game like this what requires a good connection, i last played months ago for halloween but i got the same feeling when i sat and played gta V after the hours of download and install to finally play i sit there and then watch youtube videos for the next 4 hours wondering how these guys seem to have so much fun in said games but yea seeing as it free to start off and mission and heists earn you cash to rent weapons and buy cars and mods from trade i do recommend this game so really you dont have to spend a penny but it takes some effort
4703	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.

8910	1	a	If this game is next gen then I am building a Delorean and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing myself with it's tailpipe. This game is so gay it makes my â¥â¥â¥â¥ smaller, even though asian woman want that on their feet, I don't. I will literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a cup and â¥â¥â¥â¥ that â¥â¥â¥â¥ with my tongue then finger it to hell. I would rather suck my own â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of my 2 buttcheeks than play in the garbage that makes me â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself twelve times from sunday morning.
4407	0	a	It's only gimmick is customization, it's completely biased towards the enforcer faction, everyone is a self-absorbed prick, and I am suffering chronic dehydration from how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing salty everyone is.  Even with the customization, every male character looks like an angsty edgy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and every female character looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥toy bimbo.  Surprisingly not pay-to-win, but everything in the armas market is overpriced to hell and back.  Most of the criminals are whiny 12 year olds who try to be edgy gangsters, and most of the enforcers are 30+ year old neckbeard manchildren who get in heated arguments with said edgy 12 year olds.  And the GMs do hardly anything at all.

3009	1	a	It's fo free and it's off da heezy!
1035	1	a	this game is sooooo fun
2317	1	a	Good game, but seriously needs improvement. Just because it's unique, only one of its kind in the MMO genre, that I continue to play it.  6/10  
642	1	a	Very well done for a free to play game. Great for GTA fans wanting multiplayer
327	1	a	Honestly a overall good game only current issue is the players otherwise this game needs some new players so dont rage keep playing and you'll see you can have fun in the end
9664	0	a	one of the worst game i have played in a while and i did'nt even play it.i couldn't log in no mater how many tries i typed in my account don'tplay any more games made by the develiper untill they get rid of this gamersfirst bullcrap  -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10

Bring up control pannel, it's running, end process, repeat that action 3 times, game starts, black box around screen because it can't support my huge tvs high rez, overly long tacky loading screens, then logs me in with steam, then asks for Email to create account. Nhilisticly shake head, uninstall. 10 turds out of 10, would not turd again.

1714	1	a	One of those games that has so many flaws and so many great things all smooshed up into a clusterfck of addictiveness. After 6 years I hope the engine update brings new life to this mess.
8503	0	a	Pay to win. Takes forever to advance if you dont spend money.
4170	0	a	The only good thing about this game was the character customization. Everything else is absolute shÎ¯t. Also, the developers are a bunch of greedy asshÎ¿les.
9861	1	a	Really great game, but i fail to understand the negative review..
6841	0	a	Well, I was in the game and it kept freezing while I was at the title screen.   And it froze forever...   Until i load it up again, then it freezes again.
15	1	a	Having been riding shotgun on this rocky slope since the engine first breathed life, I've bared witness to the rise and fall of many events both majestic and miniscule. From the very beginning, connecting across the ocean to the Real Time Worlds European server to participate in the closed beta program through one scheduled hour a week, I felt that there was something metaphysical at work. Something without form, without function, sleeping beneath the silver sheen of this seemingly genre changing cops and robbers MMO.   There was something there behind the flying bullets, the untapped expression of creativity driven forth from every player, the static walls of San Paro and it's fleeing citizens. Like a father watching his infant son strike his first fluke homerun well out of the confines of the park, I remember excitedly tossing and considering the possibilities of a game like APB. It was destined for many things, much of which can only be described as allegory in light of the failed future this game was given by fate.   The son that knocked the ball out of the park, he could have been in the Major Leagues. He could have been so much more. Instead, somewhere between that first fluke shot and college, he found drugs and greed and turned that bat into a tool of violence for the dealer that provided him with his fix. The story of APB, sadly, is not that much different.  I stand now with a precious handful of survivors that took the train and never got off, and it is from this seat that I can humbly nominate APB Reloaded for the 'Monument To What Could Have Been' award.    Nothing further, your honor.
10672	1	a	shazbot. ill never be good at this game. its fast. 8/10

6105	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ I have ever let my â¥â¥â¥â¥-observing eyes lay upon.   1. I've gotten up to 400 hours on this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. 2. It's absolutley all pay to win. You have no-lifes who pay 50$ to use overpowered guns that only last 14 days, along with Premium and money bought perks and cars.  3. They banned me for wearing a swatzika, and I was not notified, and apparently it was 'offensive' yet, they say they don't ban for symbolism. (The Customer Support is absolutley â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the fact that they gave me an equivilent punishment to whawt they give hackers and cheaters). 4. The maps are absolutley stale and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boring. You'll be wandering around a lifeless city going up to windows and doors clicking F, picking up items, go to zone A and B, defend for your entire experience.  5. Customization is extremley limited due to 'Premium', in which you can barely create and symbols, and customize your cars and character. 6. Again, you have to repay for a gun every 14 days, which mean constant, brainless grinding of cash for another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gun that is about the same as all other guns unless you pull out your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wallet and throw money at these money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. 7. The game is extremley outdated with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics, gameplay, and is just so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stale.  8. The people who dedicate themselves to this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ just throw money at their screens, thats it. 9. Gamersfirst has taken no effort to revive the stale experience of this game, instead of years to improve a stale piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing died until they had to 'Reload' it up, nothing has changed, except a woopty-doo 'SERVER-MERGE' YAY. 10. Its hypocritical- You have adult players wearing inapropriate â¥â¥â¥â¥ and half naked all the time, yet when a 'swatzika' is spotted, they PERMA-â¥â¥â¥â¥ING-BAN-YOU. 11. The driving mechanics are stale as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and boring, just drive and shoot â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es THATS ALL. 12. PVP combat is as stale as a piece of weat toast, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing auto asist your aim and is just un logical and stupid.  13. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
7300	0	a	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is wrong with this game?!?!?!? When I get into a district, it takes years to load. Then I try to get out from the buliding, but the game has no response. And finally, when i find some car to steal, the game crashes. Everytime when I play it runs out of memory, and it still says on Steam that I am playing.  I won't play this game again.
2192	1	a	.
6548	0	a	LOL! Surprised this game is around still.. Its like the only people who play it are either fanboys or tryhards.
8568	0	a	This game was fun for a while, but quickly got boring. Along with that you've got the most cringe-worthy and toxic of communities, and you just end up with a hot mess that likes to charge you 40-bucks for Pay to Win guns, and overall it's just not worth the effort.  This was a game we all looked forward to and drooled over... but in the end it didn't live up to what it could have potentially offered. And honestly I think a lot of that had to do with gamersfirst being in charge of it. Quit a slimey company, especially if you read any of their official responses on their forums.
6503	0	a	So awful. Its a pay to win and does'nt even try to hide it. Without buying a pemium account you are restricted to almost no weapons, vehicles or clothes.
5119	0	a	this game is an addiction i lost one of my very good friends to it...
5406	0	a	ShÂitty servers. P2W. Just get a sub @  www.artiÂfiÂciaÂlaiÂming.net  and rage all day long, that's the only use of this game until they fix it.
138	1	a	'Fresh and New' free to play.  With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.  Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.  Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.  Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a 'must play'? No. Is it horrible? No.   You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.  6.5/10
2776	1	a	Great persistant world GTA-like MMO! Absolutely love it! :D
7694	0	a	Kind of a grind.
6508	0	a	A classic example of a P2W (Pay to Win) game. Great concepts, but is just ruined by that one system.   PROS: - Great concept - Quite good graphics - Seems promising at first - Great costumization idea  CONS: - Pretty bad matchmaking - Pay 2 Play system - Unbalanced weapon prices (in the Armas Marketplace) - Server lag - etc.  Overall: 4/10

428	1	a	great game without friends i spent about the first 8 hrs just figuring out the game before i got the handle on on it and it was really fun then i started playing it with my brother one of the best video game experiences ever for me
1055	1	a	This game is awesome there is alot of things to do more than gta
4578	0	a	Hmmm What can i say about APB Reloaded... Well The game is great if there wasent so much hacking lag and general No â¥â¥â¥â¥ Given when it comes to the developers.... They just dont care about the people or game... This game is only for and ever will be for people who pay to win .... Hackers who ptw will Never get banned becuase unless uve payed more then him or have more people who ptw report him nothing will get done.. Free to play people have no pull in the game...Its terrible some of the ptw weapons being super op.. Its just an unfit game for anyone who doesnt want to spent 50+ dollars to win and troll people  2/10 f%*king Disgracefull  Gamers first my â¥â¥â¥ more like Bank account First   UPDATE: 4/10/14  Well im done with this game 150+ hours and im a decent player but its just too terrible, Ive incounterd so many hackers and Such op weapons this game isnt fun anymore Those of you who ever play F.ree T.o P.lay games Please check if its by Gamers First.  Games go to Gamers First to die slowly  Just dont play any games by these people do yourself a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Favor and Dont get frustrated
2167	1	a	This game is stupid but it's fun to mess around in. It's like GTA IV's multiplayer except with more meat and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier engine (the community is just as bad though!). I wouldn't recommend it without a friend to play with, unless you actually enjoy Arabs and Mexicans screaming at you in teamchat for 'stun gun is bad pick up a real gun noob'.
7351	0	a	Not really into it, played for an hour got bored cause I have no idea what I'm doing
9440	0	a	Ok I'd really didn't play the game but it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics and im pritty shore i had difficulties with the key binding WHAT i mean is its different to to games like this and at the start it was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T i could not loot the bodys that NPC KILLS YES THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING NPC I dont know if this effects the game later on but thats it hop it helps.
6213	0	a	Like GTA 4, but worse, and you can't do any missions because the other players are invincible.
4173	0	a	Im sick of these games, i aint gonna act like the rest of these reviewers acting like they are actually critics. What im gonna do is tell the truth. APB Reloaded is awful, the only reason its actually fun is to either troll or screw up the terrible physics engine, you go around in a dump truck and crush a player's cars and killing them, which is very fun, this aint no GTA rip off, it dosent even deserve that title, its a pay to win cash fest, buy a gun= real money, buy a car= real money, hell there is even gambling with real money! You go to a contract and then they give you a mission, its always the same, either bomb a car, steal a car or kill the enemy or graffiti some walls for some reason! Some missions no enforcers actually attack you, in some missions they do. And this is where the fun begins *sarcasm* the balance system sucks so much it could swallow a blue whale, it literally pairs you up with morons who just started the game, and the enemy are silver players with the best guns in the game, basically the game was pretty fun, untill it became pay 2 win, first started the OP guns, HEY PLAYERS PAY Â£40 FOR A GUN THAT KILLS IN 2 HITS! The game can sometimes be fun, but after a couple of hours it becomes incredibally boring and you wonder what would happen if this game wasent free? Maybe more gamemodes, maybe more stuff, maybe some actual fun. Oh yeah, this game isent cops and robbers, the enforcers get the same guns as the criminals, they have different names but they do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥, you go around in free roam and you cant start a police chase, the only time a cop can attack you is if they see you pick up a item that dosent belong to you (ram raid) and then it makes you go into this minigame where you have to put the evidence in a place and so does the cops, also the bag of evidence makes a sports car turn into a segway so good luck with that. The game would be alot more fun if the cops could actually do cop stuff, like arresting you, they should be able to spot you then have to arrest you for extra money and you go into this L.A Noire interrogation minigame, NOW THAT WOULD BE FUN, but nope the only way they can arrest you is if they stun you and arrest you then you disapear and respawn lol. 35/100 (btw if you want some real money, wait at a contract place for a ram raider to arrive to sell his stuff then steal his van full of items :D)
3389	1	a	Have not played in awhile, waiting on new engine. However, GREAT GAME!
4650	0	a	Usually I don't downvote on a game concept like this, but the gameplay APB:Reloaded offers is completely awful. Gunplay is terrible, you need to spend real money in order to keep the weapon forever, players equipped with a pistol can kill you in 2 shots, but it takes 20-30 shots to kill them with an assault rifle, (this is close combat), overall for gunplay...it's just...clunky and static. Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower. Completely it's a pay-to-look cool/win, mixed with bad game mechanics.   I like the game concept, but the ways done in the game...are just laggy and boring after a while.
2810	1	a	nice but not working plz cantact the server 
1395	1	a	10/10 would play again. PS. I need a new game please.
922	1	a	Fun,Buitefuk Graphics and awesome gameplay but pretty reapitve So i dont suggest this so much, but it is A fun game :D --------TRY IT OUT-------- problems : Are u lagging much like me like 25 - 18 fps then u should make the graphics really ugly Sorry D:
10115	1	a	.
8632	0	a	I do think this game is fun, but it is broken at the same time. The radar sucks in this game, there is hackers. But there is hackers in so many games that I play on here. It's kind of like H1Z1: Just Survive with cops and robbers, that is the best way i can explain it. Your best bet is to go in with people you know   Edit: After playing this game quite a bit, it is a play to win. You want to pay to win? You will be amazing at this game, there is a lot of hackers and rage quitting will happen. Best way to play is to go in with people that you know, it makes it easier and fun. But you will ALWAYS run into trolls and hackers no matter what.
5535	0	a	The developers of this game are f*cking f*ggots and they deserve all the hate they get. They don't respect the community at all and they just want you to pay for their sh*t instead of maybe getting a small boost since the game should actually be enjoyable enough to do so, but the servers are slower than an alsimers patient trying to remember the faces of their children.
8827	0	a	This game never worked so â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
1980	1	a	Its still a cool game i think and one of my most played games If it had updates at all it would make more people want to play...     This game hasn't been updated in like 4 years 
3006	1	a	You dont have p2w u just need some skills, but take time, now with the new patch the ahckers star to be bann and that is a progress because is more fair, this is a great game to paly with friends or to make new ones because many people are social, but a few are #####, in my opinion i love this game, but you need to try it before belive me
4136	0	a	Game itself is pretty cool its like an open world online GTA but i have to warn you.. Don't even think about playing it untill another developer manages the game since the current one is f*cking greedy as f*ck while not caring about the game itself at all.
1248	1	a	I am Danold Rump and I want you guys to not vote for my Step-brother, thank you. 
846	1	a	 TL:DR  Good game, community bandwagon raging about random stuff that doesn't exist as big as they make it sound   So there are a lot of people screaming 'Over powered gunz' and stuff like that, it's really kinda absurd. I played this game F2P for about a year before I bought Premium and I really haven't noticed a difference other than an XP boost and a few customization increases here and there, which I don't use because art to me may as well be a trashcan.  -Yes you can buy guns, are they more powerful? By default, yes. But they have massive draw backs and are really a case by case basis, and F2P guns that you can get can be modified to be more powerful than a paid gun.   -Is the community toxic? Yeah, kinda...A lot. You find a few snowflakes here and there who are nice.  -Population has been really good recently I personally haven't noticed a difference and I'm primarily on HAN, I still see people complaining but I'm willing to blame that on people jumping on the band wagon.  -Hackers? Not really..I've seen a total of 2, in about 3 years of playing, (Yes my hours are low, I played on and off for those years and originally started off with the standard APB launcher, instead of through Steam). Yes I understand they exist, but people say it's covered in hackers which I disagree with.  -Matchmaking. One thing I hear a lot is 'Match making iz broke'...It's really not, the game finds you a match based on the most suitable players, I'd rather get my â¥â¥â¥ kicked by some R255 then waiting 50 minutes for a match, and more often than not being paired against a R255 I can still hold my own meaning I'm getting paired with people of a similar skill level to me. Personally, I've rarely noticed the match making have any issues.  (I remember it used to have major issues, but they did fix that sometime this year, I think it was)  Overall this game is fun, it's well made, bugs are minimal and are patched quite quickly, I personally really enjoy what this game has to offer, I haven't been able to find a game similar to it and really enjoy it due to that.  Yes the Engine update is like..3 years late now? But really, I'd enjoy the engine update, but the game works fine so I see no issue.  There's so many things you can do within combat alone, depending on what enviroment your in and what weapon you're using as well as what faction. For example.  I play Enforcer, commonly less than lethal, now instead of killing people it tazes them, no it's not instant and it's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to do but it's fine, and once tazed you may arrest the criminal, keeping them in respawn for longer. Most commonly people will go Lethal, that's your shooty bullets that kill you, yes they hurt, and weapons in that category ranges from sniper rifles to machine guns to shotguns, the diversity of weapons is great.  Then there's the massive customization options, regarding vehicles &amp; players, even death music if you're that type of person, which I won't get to into because I'm a trash designer.  Finally your clans, you can get just your friendly clans or 'pro' clans, mostly always have some form of a symbol on them and roll around in force, which makes the game a lot easier for the people in clans as you aren't getting paired with randoms, and let's face it...Randoms aren't really people you wanna be with.  This game's 'Flaws' that the community rages about are blown out of the water, most players are just bad and blame it on hacks, or 'bugs' like most games.  I just edited this for the Steam badge Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
4152	0	a	449 hours on record, 600+ hours off. 1 conclusion, sh*t game.  Play Peggle.
4877	0	a	The system requirements are insane, and even on a decent system it will lag and sometimes crash.   Also the last time I played (2012) it really was pay to win. Any decent weapon you would only unlock for a couple days before it re-lock itself, and you wouldn't make enough money to keep up with it. Then you'd go on some mission and a guy who spent a bunch of money would just 1 shot you with a rocket launcher while you had your starting pistol and nothing else. I hope they improved this since then, but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Overall it has a lot of potential and the world is chaotic and fun, but the points above make me not want to go back.
2332	1	a	APB reloaded is Very Closely related to GTA however it is far from it. The game can be fun with a team or group of friends. The team Is Highly Pay to win though. People whom Pay for Prem get Everything just about and Is/are able to have better weapons and when 2xs more money in game to get things. The biggest Issue with the game is team Balance. There is none. You get matched up with people that are WAY higher ranked then you're self and they Expect you to deal with the fact that that have Armor on and BEtter weapons that wipe you out in a heartbeat. Would I recommend the game yes but For more of a casual play on occasion sorta thing
1704	1	a	Noting special but good.
9343	1	a	This game has come a long way since its first inception, and even more since going F2P. Totally worth it if you enjoy traveling the wasteland.
8104	0	a	The game play component has two modes, join a mission district and press k to get shot at, or join an action district and have the game press k for you, so you can get shot at sooner, as well as having more people to shoot at you. As for the ranking system, with the aid of mommys credit card it can join the plot over in the corner, ever so often clear its throat and stretching a little , and mumbling something along the lines of 'this game isnt pay to win, you can unlock all the weapons as you progress through the game' to which you will reply 'what about the weapons i cant unlock through the game' right before resumes its silent vigil. All points bullitin caters to a unique few, the extremely rich, the extremely close, and the devs, the cash shop redundifies any and all attempts at proggression, while also placing some out of reach weaponery into the game, as for the joker store...suffice to say its a joke (see what i did there). All Lag Bullitin has optomization issues, that would give the dialup era of online gaming a run for its money when it comes to unreliability, the server is secretly the worlds most advanced rng as it has awareness, but many years of neglect have lead it to become resentful of humanity and thus you will find in your moment of need, when you are soo close to murdering Xx_rApEdyeMUMm8_xX and restoring honor to you family the server will get distracted and forget to register... well anything, and after a quick game of he said she said you are shuffled along to the respawn screen, the game is horribly unreliable unless you the lucky few, then you have nothing to worry about youll be sything down noobs and veterans alike blessed by the almighty apb god we call server, with the lag armor. Having said all this there are some good points to apb such as the customization.... yup thats the only redeeming quality, if this were a fashion world simulator it would be enough, but in a badly optimized tps (third person shooter) it just means you'll look pretty while your ragdoll lays on the floor, and theres not much else to redeem the game.  in conclusion the devs are bad, the game mechanics are bad, the servers are bad, the community is   toxic garbage, left behind by the civilized word, gained sentience and decided to stage a perverse mockery of a community   bad, the funeral clothes creater is indepth and well designed.    TL;DR the games bad, unless you spend your time in bronze, then you can enjoy countless hours of blissful ignorance, while you skip along to the sound of angry 12 yearolds
4051	0	a	This game was good when it was a subscription based game when it went free to play it turned into a Pay2Win crap.
8764	0	a	Just dont waste your time on this game like i did.It's really addictive and incredibly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.P2W ,lots of bugs,â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up community and devs who dont give a f. what you have to say.Since the early beta the game is the same nothing new except few guns reskins which u have to pay your real dough for.

7917	0	a	Had high hopes.  They were crushed.  Crushed into non-existence.  -69/10
9000	1	a	A cold apocolypse MMORPG/MMOFPS/MMOTPS Story line is a bit weak and not much refered to it, but that doesn't matter. A lot of weaponry/armor/... Also RolePlay! Give it a shot ;) it's free anyway :)
10177	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
7946	0	a	the game doesnt even work
3683	1	a	Car Smashing Griefing Simulator whichever year. Of course there is more than that to this game. You buy clothes, you buy cars, you buy guns and feel fabulous about yourself, but all that comes with real world money or countless hours spent in this game. Is it worth your time you ask? Well if smashing low tier cars into high tier super cars until they explode until you get reported is your cup of tea, by all means create a bald naked fat guy and go ram everyone in the street. Also cherish the time introducing your friends to the game and finding them as disappointed about the community as you are.
2970	1	a	It's an intersting game. Criminals vs. Enforcers duking it out. It's not an MMO apart from an MMO type lobby. The game is made of closed off matches. It's more of the third person shooter variety than a MMO.
4260	0	a	Take GTA V and maybe some other 3rd Person Shooter and this is what you get. But worse. Very worse, since its nowhere near GTA V and you can't mod on this game.
5137	0	a	Where to start? Hackers, Team killers, Unknown lags (graphics), Money hunters, Bad support, Balance,
3913	0	a	BasiC is in this game. 1/10 would not recommend
4258	0	a	Great game to play if you are not planing on spending money on it. If you are planing to spend money on it DONT, waste of money and its just fkin squeezing money out of you with no rewards for you.

4238	0	a	I punched the detail out of a dudes face. Also don't hope for it to clsoe when you exit the game.
6556	0	a	Wold be a fun game if it wasent full of aim bots and wall hackers. but it is so no real point in even playing unless you like that kind of bs i know some people will say just get the aim bot for your self so you can fite back but whats the point in even playing a game where the only way to be competitive is to cheat with them then its no longer whoever is better at the game but whoever has the better hacks that some one else made because lets be honest all the kids cheating are to stupid to know how to make an aim bot.
1364	1	a	yes get this ish.....if your low-res likeing dumbass...this game really sucks

9111	1	a	I was there at start before the layoff when everyone got to eat their contract and was told to walk. The skelton crew that followed and the people who tried to keep it together (sorry Tiggs) just couldn't do more than bandage the wound. Was an awesome idea and I loved what it could have been but it's over. The company who owns it now isn't even the original one because they gave up on it and essential bugs that needed to be addressed never will as the only people who really understood it were fired early in a bid to get what little cash they could. My guess is the company that now holds it is just doing the same thing, trying to get some random subs before dropping it too. RIP Fallen Earth and thanks for the few good memories there were.
9206	0	a	When I saw this game, I expected to be somewhat of a DayZ experience to the extent that other players would be trying to kill you. I was very wrong in this assumption.   It turns out that the only enemies are the npcs. Speaking of npcs, they aren't even ok. All they do is walk around in a ten inch radius and will only attack you if you shoot at them or get really really close. Even if you're like three feet in front of their face, they will not attack you.    The weapon switch is also very finnicky. It took me five minutes just to get my character to dual wield. (that was either the game or just my lack of a good mouse   If you are looking for a game that has just an ok gameplay, I would bring this one up. But if you want a good survival game with good fighting and gameplay, do NOT get this one.
8606	0	a	Now I dont have 1000 hours plus in this game like some people here but Ive seen enough to make a fair verdict. As a noob its hard to pick up like most games. But in order to combat the higher ranking played s you either must get MLG or pay 40 bucks for a weapon. (real moeny) You could buy the weapon for a few days but then after that your screwed. I am no means good at the game but I'd like to think Im more of a novice as I was ranked silver 2 I believe? (This is actualy decent in this game not like CSGO) The whole conecpt is pretty cool and the customization amazing. But the whole combat and progression system is really hard to get used to. If anyone has anything to say about my verdict (like my opion matters) please tell me, am I just bad? am I using the wrong guns? Or am I just doing everything wrong? But for now, this game needs some serious balancing issues.
7119	0	a	This game is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥! After playing almost 200 hours + 100 before merging on Steam on my old account, i can easily say that this game is the worst Sandbox-MMO EVER! I've spent almost 100 bucks on it. Yeah, 100 BUCKS! This game is total PAY TO WIN, if you're not paying, you cant win. Also, cars, skins, guns are for real money too! And the community is the most toxic i've ever met! Seriously, even CS GO community is less toxicated that this piece of garbage! Also the optimalization of the game leaves A LOT to wish, if you're having 50 fps you are in the top 100 PC rank propably.  So, the game is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥ that costs nothing to download and to rage over it besides nerves, but it costs a lot to really play it. Who the hell thought about doing P2W system in APB? Oh, yes, the studio whose said that they are going to make the game alive. I see. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, PLAY OR BUY ANYTHING FROM THEIR WORKSHOP EVER!
3590	1	a	I remember playing this game very often and having so much fun with it. It was the first of its kind that I had seen, and was just so addicting. Not exactly a P2W game, but all their paid items do get annoying. Another thing was the unforgettably bad community. Honestly, it's not the worst I've ever seen but it was still pretty bad. Lots of cheaters and hackers, too.   Other than that, the game can be very enjoyable. It becomes so much more fun once you find a friend to play with. The gameplay itself isn't the worst I've seen, and the customization is just awesome. Now that I think about it, you can basically customize every single aspect of your character (including vehicles) in great depth.  The game is fun but does have its flaws, but it's free, so what do you have to lose? Download the game, try it out, uninstall if you don't like it.
6915	0	a	Really i like most games and this seemed fun. *from the moment your in ur pitted agest anything from rank 5 to rank 100. *most players are to overpowerd at lower stages of the game. *tbh it's again pay to win *if you take the job and some little 5 year old boy wants to do even thou he/she is in ur team they will team kill you *most just do nothing let 1 person do all and then bich when they lose all over no thanks id rather go through frachuring my arm again then try play this any longer
7525	0	a	I couldn't even play the freaken game because the stupid sky and screen of the game kept giltching and i couldn't even see. whatever you do save your memory and save your money. i would give it a 1 out of 10 if they could fix it. which might not even happen. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10078	1	a	great game
578	1	a	3000 hours spent over 2 years, 2 characters max rank and many reroll attempts. I won't bother you with my terrible English so let's do it pros and cons:  Pros (because there are pros... honestly) + atmospheric (urban settings even though it does feel like an old game). + Fast-paced - what I like and hate the most about this game (I'll explain you why). + Best customization system of all time. Believe me! I've spent hundred of hours in the editor. + Absolutly NOT P2W  Cons (ok! I'll go easy on G1): - Infested with cheaters. - Nothing interesting after 1K hours. - Boring clan system. - Toxic (adult yet immature) community. - Unbalanced weapons (Ntec, low yields, NHVR you name it!) But hey! Part-of-the-game excuse! Remember? - Poor customer support - my tip: don't buy anything or no less than 50â¬ to Gamersfirst. If you get scammed, banned for no reason there's a high chance that the GM who is in charge of the customer support (not even kidding) will kindly ask you to p*** off. - Poor community management: 1 GM for 4 servers (2000 players) ... why not? And don't tell me there's more than one, I wouldn't believe you.   Now pro&amp;con: +New engine's coming soon (Announced back in 2013), Overkill servers on Obeya - No developement in the meantime: APB has been released then shut down then bought then realesed again etc etc. Since 2011 there has been nothing we could consider like game developement. New guns and reskins aren't relevant, we want new cars, new game mechanics, weapon balance, realistic gameplay (shooting and car physics) and no NHVR jumpshooters Yoloyield spammers please!  That's it folks! If I should recommend it? Yes but make sure you have at least a good friend to play with you ... and something else to help keep calm.
824	1	a	Has its querks, but worth playing, even just on and off.
7082	0	a	Very bad, I can't even play the game. It takes like an hour to load and after that, it crashes. Unless anyone has a solution to this problem, I can't come up with a great review for this game.  1/10

4230	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
8004	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
8177	0	a	not even worth it i have to download this game twice to get it to run and it crashes my pc which is able to run it not worth the time or effort even if it is a free game its more like free piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
305	1	a	It's where you become a sexy hot Hooker with a gun and you can give people virtual â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and jack people off then taze people in the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ until they give you virtual money then become a Mexican drug dealer and drive your car off a building while masturbating to your character or be a citizen and constantly get rammed, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥,robbed,â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ON, and murdered  (This was copied from the scrub lord mark)
3818	0	a	Torturously close to being good. Can be played and sometimes enjoyed if you accept that it will never improve. Unfortunately has never been imitated by another game, so there is little motivation for improvement.
5458	0	a	wont even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work and its forcing me to like a facebook page and then says app is running.
397	1	a	Free fun.  Even more fun when you spend some money on it.
10206	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
9814	1	a	You can ride cars and grind mobs - 12/10 best f2p mmo.
3131	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
3151	1	a	Well this game is great things that are premium are just about the same as the ones you can buy through earning my biggest problem is that all the cars in this game even the premium ones are so hard to drive and in a mission some times get paired up with pros and guys who pay to win which is unfair.
5637	0	a	An extremely budget free-to-play open world game, immitating Grand Theft Auto across all areas of gameplay and experience. It is also multiplayer only.
6784	0	a	Game lags like â¥â¥â¥â¥ even on beast computers, community is â¥â¥â¥â¥ but mainly because the developers are absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥... lying about progress, making excuses not talking to community as well as randomly banning players without providing evidence, game is quite a dictatorship with poor decisions on the development team who refuse to listen to the players.
2226	1	a	I love this game! 
5004	0	a	I never played this game, because the game never runs on my PC.  I hate it -1337/10
3852	0	a	APB:R What can i say this game is a guilty pleasure of mine BUT there are sooo many broken mechanics to the game so lets name a fiew -Matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥ -all sweet items are locked off to high ranks -Extermely harsh on new players  -Cheap weapons  -G1C  i gotta say The premium feature broke it for me,locking off most of the bigger features of customization off to new players is just cheap and feels like 'HEY THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥,LETS MILK MORE CASH OUT OF IT' the new publishers are just being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ milking the cash cow all day i wouldnt have a problem if i wouldnt be getting ranked with golds on bronz and silver dics (I myself am bronze) And i think its Unair that a 255 can get into a bronz disc where there will be people ranking from 1 to 100 ,it makes it unfair and not fun getting into a game where your team is completely made from new players and the other team is made from 255s and golds, i think they should you make a level lock on bronz servers,once you hit 200 thats it you cant enter bronze servers anymore,ive been helping my friend getting into the game but as always its hard as hell getting a player who only has 20 hours on the game to get intrest init with a broken as crap matchmaking system,at least rank it by the levels or as my previus idea lock off 255s from bronze servers,i know some APB:R vets and some think i got a point others think my struggle is usles in some point it is but its stupid  What i think this game needs are some changes,changes for the better  These changes are: -Make all customization options for all players (Free and prem) -Make G1C items cheaper(Im not paying 14 bucks for a perm gun that i wouldnt even like at the end) -a way to make g1c in game from playing it or a weekly reward of 10 to 5 G1C -Free goodies and weapon rewards from mission drops -Matchmaking where ranks ranging from 50 to 60 would get matched but ranks like 10 againts 255 wouldnt -Make a permanent block on all 200+ players on bronze servers 
3329	1	a	The game just wont work. I downloaded this for gamerfirst then steam....none work. Please tell me how to fix this.
7258	0	a	Oh APB, the years I've spent playing. LAGGGGG. This game is the definition of bittersweet. Customization is the best thing this game has going for it. Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...
4102	0	a	Worst game in existance. Freezes and Crashes constantly, Hackers everywhere, Laggy, Glitchy, and a complete Clone of GTA  EDIT: It's also pay to win, the devs are money vampires, they suck the money oudda ya' wallet!  I would give this a 3/10 at least the graphics are nice, but that doesn't matter because it won't even let me frickin (YOU FREAKING FRICKS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN) move and then freeze and crash..
9758	0	a	sucks
10247	1	a	I don't recomend this game. I haven't even played it...and that's the problem. It takes forever just to check for updates. When you actually get in the game, there's no cursor or anything. It's hard to push any buttons it displays. I can't even click the freakin PLAY button. If this happens to you, don't even bother. If it doesn't, play away.
2524	1	a	i would luv this game if i didnt lag so much -_- lol
3974	0	a	Be prepared to spend $500 on in game items and still need to use an aimbot if you want to have fun

1858	1	a	This place is BAWLIN' yo. G's be pimpan like you never SEEN. I seen one and I was like 'WHAAAAT! Are you serious APB?' Mean girls workin the banks, tho. This one chick wouldn't even let me holla. I was like 'Please, you poor anyway.'
2485	1	a	Best free to play shooter
10265	1	a	This game is a very fun game its kinda like the games fall out and its even FPS or TPS and trust me u will have a blast. 
9262	0	a	This game is full of minor but very irritating bugs (especially the UI), none of which have been fixed since I tried it three years ago. I strongly suspect that the owners (who, I believe, are not the original developers) are in 'Maintenance Mode', milking the game until players tire of it, but not adding any improvements or fixing any but the most serious of issues. Just on this basis alone, it is hard to justify sinking any money into it, which means you will be stuck with the sub-standard F2P experience.  Even if the bugs were fixed, though, the game utterly fails at narration: none of the characters are memorable. The missions, though ostensibly varied by their flavor text, ultimately feel very samey. How many times was I told to 'defend your location'? In one of the last missions I did, I had to go deep, deep into a prison to kill a boss. It was hard to find him, and at one point I had to traverse a corridor almost literally packed with enemies, who stood there blankly while I murdered their comrades 4 meters in front of them. I finally got to the boss, the culmination of all the mission stories in the zone. There was no dialogue or confrontation; he just attacked me, and what ensured was a long, long fight (due to his massive amount of health) where I tried to cut him to pieces with my knives, while he shot me in the face with a pistol. It's too bad, because his story was kind of interesting. (He was cloning himself, and apparently one of his clones decided to lead the resistance against him.)  Combat is tedious, and (for my melee build) mostly consisted of holding down both mouse buttons while aiming the reticule at an enemy. This is made difficult mostly by the camera, enemies' poor pathfinding -- which frequently causes them to run around unnaturally before they home in on you -- and the facts that the game occasionally ignores your keystrokes and gives little or late feedback when it does detect your keystrokes.  There are good things about this game -- otherwise I wouldn't have spent as much time with it as I did -- but I'm not motivated to list them here, because mostly what I feel about it now is frustration.
3430	1	a	Nice game :)   Very deep customization, make your own unique Character, Clothes, Cars, logos, music themes etc.   You can buy permanent guns and clothing items in the Real money store, but all the guns in the store can be obtained free aswell from contacts just not permanent (7 days etc for ingame currency).  One of the best F2P games yet imo, but if youre thinking of starting to play now i would hold off until the upcoming Engine change.

8714	0	a	I've been playing this game for 227.7 hours in total. I honestly have mixed opinions about the game. I haven't played it for 6 months, but I can tell you everything about it.  What I really loved about the game itself was:  - The customization features - The cars, weapons, and clothing  - Cooperative players (If you have friends)  But here, are reasons why this game came into a disappointment:  - Bad shooting mechanics - Bad gaming optimization - Laggy servers - Noxious community among players (Hackers, idiots, aimbots, cheaters, etc.) - Unbalanced matchmaking - Misleading tutorials - Too much microtransactions - Greedy developers  What I overall think about the game itself is that it's cool in its own way, but it's not a game that you'll like to play very often. I would recommend this game, but not at the same time. You're free to try it for yourself if you like, but be cautious of what you're gonna face in the game.   In the end, I'll give this game a rating of 5/10.
6020	0	a	Not only did I have to start off the game using a crap gun class I would never use and I'm not good at, the typical assault rifle. But the tutorial did not explain anything about how to get new weapon classes and the playerbase were just a bunch of trolls who said 'go play cod' or 'get good' I would flank up on an enemy, start firing at him first and not miss any shots only to have him turn around and kill me instantly. The vehichle physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, flipping your car over and I found myself killed by random players outside of missions constantly.  Worst game I've ever played, worst community, worst mechanics, worst options for character customisation (at the start of the game) ever.
10101	1	a	its a fun unique game if ur looking for something with first and third person and killing enemies and a kind of a free world sandbox and with quests and horses i really enjoyed it :)
4013	0	a	This game is what would happen to GTA if Rockstar was feeled with ****ing vegatables
2906	1	a	Why do I keep coming back to this game? I honestly can call this my first MMO RPG
10451	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
7102	0	a	They force you to give them you e-mail after install, and it takes forever to load.
10415	1	a	I dont know if people still play this game via steam.but,i do play this game every time every day in my life this is the best rpgo game ever in the world,more than any other games...its should get to top 10 most popular f2p !!
6003	0	a	would be good if it could start 10/10 
7656	0	a	I thought this game would of been good untill i download and it dosent even open!!!! i would like it if this was not bugged
6356	0	a	Ok, I am going to be 100% fair on this review. If you don't want to read a lot in short don't buy it scam is being nice when talking about this game.  First, the Good. The game was a fantastic idea and subject. The customization level is super.  Where it starts going down hill is there is no way to deal with issues like people interfering or cheating in other people's missions. An example you are driving away in a vehicle to protect someone and the opposing team ask friends not in the mission to ram your car and pin you in a location. you have no ability to retaliate it would be better or more fair if you could at least shoot back and kill the drivers of such cars as a deterrent. The most you get is a report system which no one ever gets kicked from that I can tell after all there is no real way for them to tell what went on and they really want to keep money coming in.  Then it gets worse than the rampant cheating and hacking crap.  Anything good in the game is going to cost you real world cash through G1C which is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rip off to hell at 400 for 5.00 considering what you get in return compared to even other games. At least most real world currency systems are a penny or less per credit.  The other option is joker credits which you can earn at a healthy 10,000 in about 2 months.  Then there is no real balance to the game you will be continually put up against people who either have â¥â¥â¥â¥ loads of real world cash to throw away on good weapons and crap or you will be put against people with enough level to make it pointless.  A company that actually gave to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the users and the experience wouldn't be selling better weapons for real cash. You would find stuff that doesn't actually effect performance for sale. You can see this in countless game be it CS:GO or planet side anything you can pay for you can earn in game.
600	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this games good
6134	0	a	Stupid, starter missions you get put up against high levels who have spent all their mothers money to get maxed gear, inwhich they just farm you from the get go, 9/11 wouldn't even bother with this pos
2863	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
1231	1	a	I played this during alpha when it was broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥, would play again, maybe.
10060	1	a	HELL YEAH!! It's a very awesome combination of MM and FPS, the big world is amazing, the way every looks and feels around you is amazing!
2747	1	a	This game has addictable gamplay but also it's poorly optimized ( Laggs,fps problems)
7616	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ the game is fake you w8 3 houreews to download and then you can even launch the game...

9133	0	a	This game gave me cancer
6642	0	a	Every time I press the game steam says the games already running and i cant even get to the launcher
2941	1	a	Fun game, though slowly turned into a pay to win, but still, worth playing if new to the whole, MMO.
8804	0	a	50% trying to make the game launch, 50% loading screen...Only good part was the uninstalling.
5106	0	a	I would not recommend this game to a single person unless they plan on pulling money out their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to be able to enjoy anything.  The community is horrible and consists of the same players winning over and over due to using the cash shop weapons and such.  There is no balance at all, you ready up and get thrown into missions with people that have been paying and playing for a whole lot longer than you.  Very rarely will you find a few people that are nice to play with.  Did I mention the community is a bunch of trolls?  1/10 the 1 in the rating is for that nice person who helped me beat a few ridiculously high level players in a mission for once
9974	1	a	Very well made, alot of freedom and... well it's just done right. It's basically Fallout 3 online but a bit different, not in a bad way though. Also it's now recently become free to play so there is no harm in trying it! What do you have to loose =D
8577	0	a	runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ being burned on a dead quadriplegic while sitting still on the ground and slapped a cops and robbers sticker on it   10/10 would lag like â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
447	1	a	This is a 3rd person shooter PVP based game with some very good customization options. There really is no PVE so don't try playing if you're looking for a co-op GTA type game. It's 100% PVP based.  The character customization is really good &amp; there is also an art kiosk to make your own designs.  This is what I made a while back when I last played.         The Hog Mobile&nbsp;
2421	1	a	It's the multiplayer version of cops and robbers you've always wanted. It almost feels like it's pay to win, but it totally isn't.
7091	0	a	this game can be good game but because the managers of the game that only make stuff to sell in real money (weapons,cars,clothes) and they doesn't fix the hit regs and to try to fix the game and to make new engine. that why it's bad game.
8146	0	a	THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE DO NOT PLAY
988	1	a	THIS GAME IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CANCER CONNECTING TO SERVER AND NEVER WORKS AFTER I SPENT 7500 HOURS ON IT AND PAID ALL MY SHEKELS AND IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING ME LOVE BACK.  but damn this game got cool backpacks.
9899	1	a	its REALLY. i mean REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY laggy close to the start of the game. im not going to give any spoilers but close to where u meet the first people that tha help u. im talk extremly laggy. but mabey it can be fixed in the otions, how knows, but i sorda like the idea of the game
8932	1	a	This game is fun Just needs players.
2211	1	a	This game is great fun and you easily get hooked to it. Both maps are amazing and teamwork strives in this game. The customization is epic and will get you editing you characted/cars for hours. The major problem to this game is that it is a pay to win, if you are going to spend some money, think twice.
8818	0	a	This game is getting dead faster and faster. perfect, but its your bad, devs, you dont give a single one about the community. only the new thing you release is an update with a car that can only be bought with some p2w cash? really? this is just fun  APB 2010 - 8/10 was fun APB:Reloaded - 0/10 just awful  Let me just put this into a small review of APB:Reloaded  This game community is absolute garbage, it is the most pay2win game I ever seen, devs dont give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game, matchmaking is the worst, worse than cod, bad performance, if you have wealthy mum with some huge â¥â¥â¥ money filled credit card, play this game.  if you dont... please, dont even install this game and just give it a 'No' at your review. this garbage doesnt belong on steam.
1872	1	a	If you've ever wished Saints Row had more of a multiplayer focus, this game is for you. It's like the devs took everything we loved about the open world genre - the vehicles, the combat, the costumes, the weapons - and turned it into an mmo. This game is fun to play solo, but with 3 friends and a mic connection it is the closest thing to the perfect mmo you will find this decade. There is nothing more fun than driving a car with 3 of your mates hanging out the windows shooting everything that moves.  With an incredibly detailed world, fully customizable outfits and cars, a dynamic mission system, and a huge variety of weapons, this game is a PVP'ers dream come true. It's got a level of polish and attention to detail that other free to play mmo's lack.   NOTE: If you want the best latency, join the Han Server in Hong Kong. The average ping is about 120 - 150, which makes a nice change from having to connect to US servers on the other side of the world.
3951	0	a	Just suck.

6427	0	a	FAQ:Why do I hate this game?  A)After playing about a 100 hours in the game i noticed a few things that i hate :  -Pay2Win concept : Are you a rich dude with $400 bucks to spare?Do you like good weapons?Do you like super cars?  If you are willing to spare about $400 or MORE then this game is for you!  -Hackers : Are you good at hacking games?Do you like to cheat and get the upper hand easily?  Then this game is for you!  -Do you like lagg?Do you like crashes?  Then this game is for you!
4249	0	a	Character and vehicle customations are good  Gameplay is terrible, bad 3rd person shooting mechanics pay to win weapon and micro transaction model awfull matchmaking
9230	1	a	The game is still alive, though it requires more players and better economy. If it were developed in early 2000's, it would have become the best game of a century
10732	1	a	Its geat, but the only bad thing is, THAT IT WONT DESCEND !!! D:
400	1	a	Dance off simulator 2015   10/10

9310	1	a	It's Good I guess. O.O
7060	0	a	It takes way to long to get started I was bored of this game before I even got to play it.
10095	0	a	Bad: The controls are super weird and annoying until you change them, The graphics aren't the best but thats fine, looting is annoying, I also dont understand why we need to see all our skills at the bottom when we can just hit Y (default enteract button) to activate the thing, and you really need to pay attention in the start or else you won't under stand a thing which I really hate  Good: The story isn't bad, everyone is preaty nice, dosn't lag like crazy, and its free.
2376	1	a	This game is da sauc.
7507	0	a	Be all you can't be, in this game everyone wants to be a hacker.
843	1	a	cooool game Action
3102	1	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
2951	1	a	This is probably the best rage simulator on the planet.  I am a very in control person when it comes to fast paced shooters even when my computer physicly cannot keep up but this game has managed to release my inner anger i never knew i even had. But dispite all the times you will be angered, infuriated, and made really mad this game is actually really fun.  This game has great customization over your character and even over all the vehicles you own. You want chrome plated wheels you can have it. Police lights? no problem (enforcers only btw) and you can even make your own decals to put on your clothes and cars and even as your ingame logo.  The shooter mechanics of it are good in that it allows you to peak around corners, crouch, and even switch which hand your character uses. You can also take (except for enemy owned or someone elses personal spawned one who isn't in your group) every single car in the city a civilian is driving and use it and pretty much destroy every sign, car, etc... in your way.  Pros: Great customization. Open World Shooter. Matches, open world stuff, and close, medium, and long range combat.  Cons: Lots of lag and some issues with performance (for now they may fix it) Toxic community (its really bad with the occasional good person.) And the occasional aimbot that will get banned in the next few minuets but does not change the damage it caused.  10/10 Would rage, logoff, think, and log back in again.
6264	0	a	When you uninstall just right!
9563	0	a	Why is this game so bad? It has to much crap to be good, I don't even know how to start. First off it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥, it is â¥â¥â¥â¥. The mechanics is â¥â¥â¥â¥. The whole game i â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like normal games I atleast know waht to do, in this game I don't I just wander around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot beacuse im clueless.
6283	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.
9234	1	a	very much like Fallout and STALKER. This game is very interesting with its PvP and mechanics which i enjoy very much and the transportations like horse's, and vehicles are a good feature. The community of Fallen Earth is the best part, everyone doesnt try to kill you they're pretty much friendly unless you kill someone then theyre gunna all go in a all out war with you. If you play PvP and kill someone with a different faction there WILL be consequences like for example, getting more noticed which is a problem since that will lead to death for you. I reccomend this game if you love Fallout and/or STALKER.
490	1	a	I would strongly reccomend this game for anyone who ever happened to play any of GTA games and liked it, but felt it lacks action and multiplayer, because that's exactly what this games has to offer. In this game you can choose to play either as a criminal or as an officer. It has an extremly long and hard leveling system that will keep you busy and has to offer a lot of vehicles, weapons and even clothes. More of than, it has almost unlimited customisation options for everything, starting from graffity and finishing with customisation of your personel vehicle.   Feel like it's time to take a break from your usial calm games and kick some â¥â¥â¥? Than what are you waiting for? Download it and go for it!
1974	1	a	Good game! Love it a lot :)
10026	1	a	I like the post-apoctliptic style
5229	0	a	It won't run!
1109	1	a	very good....to a point....but the good is way more then the bad
6929	0	a	This game is a ripoff of and its not even fun, dont get this game if you want a game like GTA, just get GTA instead of this crap
8508	0	a	Was tempted to play the game after watching some gameplay. The only thing in the beginning that had me a little uninterested was the fact that there were people running around in weaboo outfits but that's just a small personal issue. After playing it with a friend for a few hours it was pretty clear that grenades were a fan favorite. Didn't have fun at all, we were going against players who were 'Max Prestige' I never cared to look at how the leveling works but that seems to be pretty damn high. First review I have done on a game and my butt hurts so much from this weaboo-grenade mess of a game.
3396	1	a	its a great game alotlike gta with saints row
5855	0	a	HATE IT wont load and its glitching like crazy ]:
9835	1	a	I must admit, I thought I was going to HATE this game straight from the intro. So much so in fact, that I had tried it before and quit almost immediately! But with a little bit of motivation from my friend Monstar, I whent passed the horrid introduction, and was pushed into an open world environment full of adventure and intricacy!  Fallen Earth is a highly community based, adventurous, and well-balanced post-apoc MMO. If you are a fan of the Fallout series, you will most definately love Fallen Earth, as it is very similar in appearance mood. The community is very tight and helpful, boosted by the finely balanced economy and trading system. The community is also enriched by the placement of 6 factions that hold alliances as well as enemies.  The only caviot to playing fallen earth is it's lack of satisfying combat as well as it's difficulty when it comes to leveling (seriosly it takes AGES) But as long as you keep an open mind and are willing to spill quite some time into this game, I can assure you that you will have a good time. Just as long as you can get through the intro.
8268	0	a	it sucks cant even play can anybody tell me how to do this
7837	0	a	This would have been awesome at launch with tonnes of peeps in constant battle. Small crowd playing now, most of whom are too deadly to really get a start in

8348	0	a	This game is absolute piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and a waste of time. It takes 5 hours to load 2 seconds to exit and 5 hours to quit the game.... fk this mothafkin piece of time wasting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5520	0	a	A really stupid game with bad graphics, GTA III level bad, and you have to pay to even enjoy this game or else you just respawn... die and repeat  very infuriating, and very stupid people running it, the only good (and bad) thing about it is there is always new guns and stuff that's always better than what came before it, just to keep you buying more and more useless items with your hard earned money...   Oh yea, and don't glitch coz they ban you for that, and they see that it's not their job to fix it, it's your job not to exploit it... lol
3969	0	a	pay to win with some of the biggest pay walls i have ever seen
10246	0	a	Community was atrocious. Immediately killed by other users. Scolded for accidentially using caps and then harassed.
7122	0	a	I think you should probably take this game off Steam. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing used 5 Gb of my data &amp; the game didnt even start.
3855	0	a	A shadow of its former self.
819	1	a	Best game ever, most fun and addicted game i have ever played, it would be much better if there werent so many bugs, but defiantly worth playing.
8642	0	a	The admins are clueless, the mods who are not employed with the company are ignorant, the cheaters have taken over the game, Deep Silver is ruining their game, the admins are nowhere to be seen, the only employee who appears to have any form of discussion with players is CM Tiggs, i never met her, even though when i was a GM/CM over at T3Entertainment, i heard she use to be a CM with HanbitSoft, even though I'm not sure if that was true or not. I have nothing against her personally, but she needs to do something with the forum mods and get rid of them.   Depsite the BS. I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.
7474	0	a	I so dont like it, its boring and horrible your better of Playing 8BitMMO
906	1	a	Game is different seems almost to pay to win and most the community is toxic
512	1	a	Ive been playing this game for years and i think its time to write a review.  Cons:  1.Toxic people, a ton of them. 2. Horrible servers. 3. Everything is too expensive on the Armas marketplace, i mean seriously, 20$ for a weapon thats a reskin of the base game item. 4. Matchmaking is horrible. 5. People take the game too seriously, they have to win every mission and hate people that do bad, its kinda pathetic.  Pros: 1.There are some good people in the toxic community. 2.Its pretty fun when you get used to the game, if you can handle the servers, that is. 3.The cars/customization options. 4.Same as 3, but with clothes and character customization.

7360	0	a	Going into APB Reloaded, I expected an alternative to GTA. One that had many traits that made GTA so successful. If you've ever played any of the GTA titles, you know what I mean. Anyways, this game is a very big download, so please, be prepared to wait. Once the game finally launched, you decide which faction you'd like to be apart of. Criminals, or Law Enforcement.   Each is unique in it's own way. The character creation is extremely in-depth, I'll give the game that.   But the main question is, is this game a good alternative to GTA? In my opinion, no. The game takes way to long to load, around 6-10 minutes EVERY time. The story line is hard to understand, and the game is very much Pay-to-win. You can tell within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The game is NOT newb-friendly. In missions, if you are a low-level it is extremely hard to find a group that wont kick you out. You can't use planes, boats, ships, or anything for that matter. The only thing you can do, is hijack cars.  The ONLY joy I had in this game was hijacking cars, and shot random civilians. Which is one shot, instant kill. No matter what. It takes forever to become wanted by the police, and when you are, a big clash ensumes. Awsome right? Nah. I crashed every time I entered a deathmatch.  Overall: 5/10: Don't get this game.  Sum-up: A very limited, stripped down, version of GTA.
10595	1	a	I've spent over 500 hours on this game, having had no experience with the previous games in the franchise, and I can say one thing about it that I'm completely sure of: It's very, very good.  Hirez made a fantastic shooter, that, in spite of its high critical acclaim and praise, never managed to secure an audience large enough to merit its continued development, and caused it to only exist as a 'live' game for a year after coming out of open beta. The studio got a lot of flak for moving its focus over to another risky endeavour, which is the MOBA Smite, which paid off after Smite saw a lot of commercial success and propelled the studio from a small 20-man staff to employing over 80 people.   I recommend playing Tribes: Ascend without hesitation, as it is the best online shooter I've ever played, and in spite of some balancing issues, and lack of studio support, I will continue playing for as long as the servers don't burst into flames and die, at which point the game will probably die too.   Go in, have fun, shoot people, and try not to rage too much when hyper-skilled players gun you down with automatic weapons 4 times over. It's a lot of fun if you play it for fun.
6789	0	a	It's a game that you play a whole lot for a weekend then never go back to it.
4962	0	a	pay to win
7693	0	a	Just terrible. I played it for 20 mins and deleted it when I realised it's just a tacky rip off of GTA.
2657	1	a	Really addictive high octane 3rd person shooter reloaded with adrenaline shots on every single mission. Huge cities, nice environment, pimped cars, cool music, extreme customization options, tactical missions, good people, good fights. Almost ruined my life!* 10/10 &lt;3         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded Live Action Trailer HD&nbsp;
222	1	a	This is a great game, With the latest set of updates and monitoring of the servers you feel like your playing for fun and not to outdue questionable players. This game is a great catch if your looking for some serious customization of your ride, character and Weapons. Able to customize to your hearts delight with logos, paterns and the like, this is a fast paced game that brings out the best and worst in people. out of 5 stars i give it a 4
10646	1	a	Amazing game, many say its dead but not yet. I recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet.
4452	0	a	APB Reloaded was a fun game at first, but things took a turn for the worse. The game is a huge pay-to-win, you have to buy in-game money to actually be able to even have a sliver of hope in winning PvP battles.  The verdict? Don't waste your time on this game.
10569	1	a	This game is good again.
7314	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS BUNNY HOP SIM. EVERY and i mean EVERY enforcer bunny hops camps and does everything scummy do no waste your time or space with this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥

476	1	a	its a great game love it if you want a free GTA/sunset overdrive game you got it 
4365	0	a	APB is like Donald Trump, exciting and amusing at first, but once you get past the bull â¥â¥â¥â¥, it starts to dawn on you how bad they are.  I've had history with this game, and decided to come back. I was bored and needed something to do. Here's a synopsis of how a day in APB goes. 1. Take 30 minutes to log in. 2. Spawn into the world and I become Nightcrawler, with the ability to teleport short distances. 3. Steal a car, try to drive, go across everything but the road. 4. Ready up for a mission, it's a 1v1, guy is already at the objective as we start, i'm 200m away. 5. I meet up with the enemy with my default weapon, fps and lag cooperate to make me spray like hell and somehow get a kill 6. Repeat. 7. Enemy corner Camps objective. 8. He wins. 9. Try to get a better weapon. 10. Don't have enough money. 11. Only way to get a lot is to do missions. 12. I realize I can't do missions with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gun. 13. I try anyway. 14. Guy with shotgun shoots my car while I'm stuck trying to get out of a wall. 15. I blow up. 16. Deletes APB. If you have a beefy computer and like to spend money this game is for you.
3705	1	a	A poor mans GTA V so why not get it right it's free doesnt have much game content but it is still fun to play but it does have some pay to win aspects
8050	0	a	When i looked at screenshoots i really thought that this game is amazing. But unfortunatelly i discovered it is not so good as it looks. Stupid quests, useless customization... It is just not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun to play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It sucks for real. So i really NOT RECOMMEND to play this game, because its nothing but wasting of your time.
560	1	a	Note: This game is NOT pay to win, people with no time and skill spent into this game are full of ****. So put that aside â¥  List of goods and bads of this game below  Good: -Good quality team fights -Great customisation (Clothes, themes, vechicles, graffiti sprays) -Open world fights (Can literally flank from anywhere) -Weapons paid for ingame cash(Weeks time for a weapons for ingame cash) -Easy market system -Preferred maps (There is 2 type maps, one focuses on close range and one on long)  Bad: -Engine promises for years (Graphic update that never happend) -Toxic players -Couple of glitches (Car glitches into map) -Bad optimisation (Game is not very well optimised and will freeze every couple of minutes)   These are my opinions from playing 1256 hours  Hope to see the game get fixed up and play more with a future engine update.
3424	1	a	good game good game i dont even like this game 10/10 I would install and uninstall this game!
6837	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was

5346	0	a	Just get any Saints row or GTA game, its better then APB in everyway, don't get me started on the hit detection.
5181	0	a	i'd rather cut my own nipples off while playing a violin made out of raw buttcheek than to play this game. its booty
5280	0	a	Well where should i start.   1 off i have been off this game for 3 years To come back and be banned with a perma suspended account.   Contacted support Only to get tell to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off And now they ignore every ticket i send in even over a different game.   All and all   Pay to play game Nothing to do with free to play anymore   Support dosent give a damm about the players  Devs Lost theyre passion for the game   BUY THIS DLC TO UNLOCK how about no   Has not changed since i left it   all and all People there are better rpg Games to waste money on   Cheers Junkie
6569	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
6536	0	a	this is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks 
1963	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
4708	0	a	I wish I had read the reviews before I actually went into the game a few years back. For the most part, you need a high end desktop to run this. I had found the concept interesting, but now it just runs rampant. The customization is really nice. However, this is NOT new user friendly (I'm an average player). I had no clue what I was doing. Everything seem expensive and confusing.
3469	1	a	Don't feel like getting Saints Row the Third or GTAV? You will feel right at home with this type of chaotic madness gameplay. The game is alot of fun running around doing missions that take teamwork. But this free to play does suffer game crashes for now until it gets fixed in the future. 8/10
8114	0	a	Credit card = MVP EVRRY TIME!!!!
10147	1	a	This is a game you can put hours and hours into and still have something to do. It has a very helpful community and moderators are almost always online. There is a very wide variety of weapons and clothing and you can also get many vehicles. It has an online store if you go on gamersfirst but it doesn't really give any advantage in terms of strength or firepower, the best you can get is premium and new mounts. Some glitches here and there including teleporting AI and wallhacking AI but thats most games. I haven't ever seen a hacker my entire 230 hours of gameplay so thats always a plus. To sum it up, it has a good engine to play on, VERY HUGE map and so many different missions and items it will keep you busy for awhile.
8871	1	a	The 3 day install was my favorite part.
6691	0	a	At first, I was like: Hey, this is pretty fun!  And then I was like:  I can't even start this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ unfuncional game without needing to restart my computer.  At least fix the damn game.
5496	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
22	1	a	APB Reloaded summed up, is a roller-coaster of a game. There will be days were you are on fire and loving the game. Then there will be days were nothing is going right, and youâre wondering why you ever tried the game out in the first place. I canât tell you if itâs a good game or not, thatâs your decision as a person. What I can tell you is this. If you go into the game expecting to win a lot and go super saiyan youâre in for a load of hurt. But if you go in to the game just to have some fun or blow off some time, who knows you might be in for a surprise. Yes winning is a lot more fun than loosing but winning isnât everything. Give the game a try, itâs free. I mean what do you have to lose? Time?
3388	1	a	RON IS â¥â¥â¥â¥
4142	0	a	APB has got to be the worst free to play game out there! it doesn't use any antihacking programs and most of it's players have a bad attitude! It's a pay to win game, wich means they ripoff their players because they don't stop the hackers, wich means people who pay for ingame guns to be better really arent because there are hackers everywhere! When you join a mission you will either get kicked from it by the leader coz of your low rank or your team mates will kill you to annoy you, then when you get enemies they will kick you. it's a horrible game to play, it only causes stress! 0/10 from me, i uninstalled it because i hate the attitude of its players. (Games are suposed do be fun and enjoyable).
5699	0	a	Horrible
8155	0	a	Imbalanced Pay2Win game with a lot of potential, only pay when you have the cash to invest! If you really do it can be loads of fun, watch out for griefers though.
7052	0	a	Three words, pay to win. If it was a non f2p MABY it would be good. 'team game' BULL â¥â¥â¥â¥ nothing about this game is team oriented, whether its the server lag â¥â¥â¥â¥ing over every one or if it is players being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I cannot say but either way its not wortha any investment time or otherwise. -7581/10
8033	0	a	the tutorial isn't really describing how everything works.
8396	0	a	By far the worst game 'on the market'. It has easily crumbled to ruins after what the current leaders have done to this game. They let it die and they ruined so much behind it. It used to be a fun, great, addicting game. But now it's a struggle just to even attempt to play the game. The issues that are presented are overwhelmingly frustrating. Let's talk about these flaws.  The connection issues that arose as of late making the game unbearable. The server has some serious kind of issues where the game freezes, your ping spikes up anywhere from 1-200 at this exact moment, your FPS drops up to 50% or more, and you start teleporting or 'rubber banding'. I have never, never in my entire life as a gamer, played an online game that had connections issues this bad. These spikes occur a few times throughout the minute, ranging from a couple to maybe 10 or even more.  Next, we get into the development of the game and who's behind it. Basically, the development is non-existant. This game has barley changed over the course of years. The original developers that had heart and care to make this game great and work on have been gone for quite a long time. We are presented with MEDIOCRE updates time and time again. The only updates that do come out take much too long and bring content that is meaningless. The big picture of this game is a complete failure. A new engine upgrade has been in the works for what, close to two years? Where is that development? We get pictures and false promises. False promises is all that this game is made of. The dev team is quite pathetic no matter what the size. I know teenagers that would do a better job with their amateur development skills in less than 3/4 of the then that of APB devs. And those devs that did stay up until recently are leaving to pursue better things.  There is simply no creativity left. There is nothing left. The game has no quality, it isn't fun to play. It's dying and it's been dying.  In game there are so many issues, so many things that need tweaking. The updates that we do get are horrible and frowned upon by the community time and time again. Lots of aspects in the game that are flawed, don't make sense. Bugs, glitches, stuff that has been here for YEARS completely ignored. Lots of cries that were never heard or reached out to. This is negligence at it's finest. The player never had a say in anything.  They attempted to merge the districts together in order to 'better' matchmaking and open more opportunities. However this was the start of all of the connection issues and the real death of this game. Even with the merge, the servers are very much dead. They have less players than the servers had alone before the merge.  This alone paints the picture of how this game has been going downhill.  Time and time again they neglect their fans that have been loyal all this time. And we get nothing at all in return. Customer support has forever been non existant and they really won't care to help you no matter what kind of issues you have. I have been faced with this multiple times. Gamersfirst staff only care about pushing more sales and more 'joker mystery boxes' because they think this is where the appeal lies. They only ever cared about the money. And nothing else. We are all bent over with our knee-pads on and sodomized terribly to this company.  Tiggs was the worst thing that ever happened to this game. I was never even slightly fond of her. She is just a muppet and her personality, tactics, and loyalties are a disgrace to the game. Why, out of all people, her? Just take a good look at this person and realize that she was a mistake.  Today stands the day where I lost everything I had for this game. There was a time I was so addicted I left my life behind for this game. A time where I considered this the best game of all time for how unique and creative it was, different for the time. It was that fun and addicting. However that is no longer. And if I were to rate this game today as it stands, I would give it maybe a 2.5/10. I even think the worst multiplayer game of all time (Infestation Survivor Stories) puts this game to shame.  I honestly hope that this game dies very soon or gets a major overhaul with a complete new owner and staff. But that won't. Once this game dies it will be taken into private hands and modded by fans that will make the game great again.

5064	0	a	This game is jackshit. It is literally impossible to play, there are no instructions on where to go, I was lost like an asian kid at the Supermarket. Like oh my god, I didn't even know how to put on clothes. Apparently there are 2 sides. Cops, and criminals. I chose the Cops first because I was curious. I spent about 45 minutes in the beginning tutorial, because they didn't say anything about going to your inventory. I quit on that side, and I went to the criminals side. Even more confusing, as confusing as a Rubik's Cube made By Stephen Hawking with the Theory of Relativity. I just started the tutorial and they just go, 'well, do this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play.' And they don't give actual instructions. I just spawned a tiny little smart car and started driving around in the City crashing into other players. This game is a pile of donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't even think about getting it. This is basically GTA's little autistic midget albino baby who is blind.  My friend recommended this game to me. We're actually not friends anymore.
5933	0	a	Server performance will give you an aneurysm.
4000	0	a	10/10 game , couldnt even start it
5232	0	a	they're just milking whatever little amount of revenue they can from spanish and brazilian children with money to spend on garbage in this waste of potential turned waste of space it'll be dead within next year
9370	1	a	Well if your into those shity games like minecraft well it's better to play this game you can get ATVs and cars and go on missions I think it's the best game I've ever played
2080	1	a	It's good, but there is a pay2win aspect, but you can overcome such. It's pretty fun, and there are events where you can gain items that you'd usually pay for therefore lowering the pay2win ratio.
7973	0	a	If you like pay 2 win, bugs, lag, and s*** gameplay then this is the game for you
3235	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
6653	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
10370	1	a	Very fast pace :3 
5649	0	a	Unless G1 fixes the matchmaking, new players should probaly stay away from this game, The matchmaking is terrible, Having to play against Rank 255 when im rank 87 is not fun at all, Threat does not matter at ALL in this game, You can still be a Silver Rank 255 and drop into a bronze district and just destroy all the new players, I dont know WHY people do it, but its not fun for new players or amateur players.
6890	0	a	I played the game before it was reloaded. Lets just say that while not playing the game I enjoyed much better games made by a developer that don't ban you because you asked them why you got an email from them.  Lets say this from when I did play. The controls suck it has no controller support to make driving better.  The graphics are not terrible but they could be better.  The physics engine used is a joke.   The amount of hackers is insane.   -This is what you get for asking why you got a email notice-  Dear Player,  Your GamersFirst account has been suspended in the past 24 hours.

4166	0	a	i try using the client it keeps crashing errorYou were kicked by PunkBuster for the following reason:  'PunkBuster kicked player 'PlayerName' (for 0 minutes) ... RESTRICTION: service communication failure: PnkBstrBprogram driver failure (PnkBstrK.sys) ffab'  i have tried the PunkBuster random kick fix where i need to download the PBsetup and then install that to the APB Reloaded folder, And then run it and install PunkBuster again, Then add APB Reloaded to the game list and check for updates. I've done all this about 5 times i have also download the PBsvc to try and fix any errors within PunkBuster but have not found a solution that has done anything to help, So now i am on here begging for a solution to this pointless annoying problem, in the hope that someone smarter than me might no what i may have missed out on.  i am having the same problem but i deleted it and download it again shut down my laptop and it worked a little bit like a few minutes but then it crashed and said the same thing again and was unable to log into it at all.  i like this game its a really good game i played a little bit the shooting was good but in the video grenade should of killed people throwing grenade should of killed people if they had no body armour .  not being able to host your own game or host room is really bad and not being able to solo with out using matchmaking really sucks since if there no one online i have no idea but if you can't play with out matchmaking or players that is honestly stupid since this game looked amazing and creating your person very good programming and car programming and the aiming and the blood shoot dripping is perfect.  this game looks really good so far i played it a little bit but it needs a lot of love and lot of work it could be the best gta for steam.
1693	1	a	It is here, where you will step into the dumptruck...and into history.
2540	1	a	fun as heck 
4194	0	a	Okay. This is pretty hard for me. I've been playing All Points Bulletin ALOT. I played it back when Realtime Worlds released it. I played it the time where you could leave your character in the 'Car Creator' over night and gain multiple thousand of dollars for doing nothing. Good times!  Back then, it was a fun new idea. Massive Multiplayer Third Person Shooter! It was GTA, but online with friends! Shoot with or against your friends through various locations, get new cars and edit your own music. The character creation and customization is beyond great! Very deep and there are so many different clothing options that all are design-able. Back then the game cost about 50 dollars, and you paid for the time you played. And when you had bought your X number of hours, it only counted the minutes you were in the game. There were plenty of ways to get even more hours, just by playing the game! And you wanted to. Damn, I played the sh*it out of it.  But alas, Realtime Worlds went down in 2010. Along with the game itself. Plenty of gamers from all countries were upset about this. I even logged in on the last day it was online, playing with the admins. Teleporting around and up on tall buildings. It was upsetting, really.  But then in the first half of 2011 All Points Bulletin: Reloaded was launched. And now it was Free-to-Play. It was great! Back was the customization, back was the open city and the cars. And for a time everything was great.  But sooner than later you started feeling the 'Free-to-Play' restrictions. And it pains me, because I enjoyed the game very much in its young years. Now you have to pay to be a 'premium' member. Which basically is what the game was for everyone back in the day. Your design slots are restricted unless you pay, which was on of the big reasons this game was so great. The game is infected with hackers and Pay-to-Win people who empty their credit cards on Armas Marketplace (Which basically is a 'Pay five dollars for the greatest weapon in the game' kind of shop) just to dominate every game. The ranking system, which was created to separate the newbies from the hardcore, is broken and unbalanced. If you go from Bronze to Gold in the same map, you will not be removed until you leave yourself. Most experienced players will just lose on purpose and kill themselves until they rank down to bronze, so they can join the newbies and kick their asses.  And the worst part? I can understand that. Because the Gold ranked servers are so infected with Hackers and 'Pay-to-Winners' that, unless you're willing to use hundreds of dollars, you wont stand a chance against.  Back then, when Realtime ran the show, I would probably have given the game an 8/10. I enjoyed it so much, and it was so different from everything else on the PC at the time.  But now? As I said earlier, the game was GTA with friends. Now we have GTA 5 Online (On PS3/4 and Xbox 360/One. Pc from mid-April), which does everything APB did, but better. I can't look away from the game's HUGE problems. The hackers got to go, and the Armas Marketplace has to be balanced with the weapons you can buy from vendors in-game. How the f*ck are anyone else going to stand a chance? And in general the free-to-play rules don't fit the All Points Bulletin I knew. Though I understand the practice, seen from a company's eyes. ($$$)  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it should be to play around with the games amazing in-depth editor. It's on cars, characters, clothes, tattoos and more. But not much else. Today, it earns a 4/10 from me. Don't play it, unless it is to fool around for a bit.  I play it primarily for nostalgia. Nothing else.
10264	0	a	This game is messy and is free for a reason. Just simple dont play it, there is more out there that is WAY better.
7132	0	a	can't play the game. spent an hour in loading menus and got to play 5 min before being kicked by punkbuster for unknow reasons.....
2330	1	a	Relly good game, i like it, i tell my friends for the game and they started playing.
3623	1	a	1. Multi Player .  2. Open World .  3. Action .  10/10 &lt;3 .
1965	1	a	Fun, but major pay 2 win, hackers , maybe lag and kids running their mouth
6952	0	a	cant run it so i got a new laptop for this game. still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my heart with crappyness (update) i had some fun then realized irs â¥â¥â¥â¥ and dedownloaded it  â¥â¥â¥â¥/7
8968	1	a	Obviously it's getting a good review, 341 hours at the time of writing this.  I can't think of another game I have wasted such a large portion of time on than this one. It's a great game, I suggest you at least try it and play until you're level 15. If it hasn't captivated you by then it won't.
634	1	a	Ignoring the fact the game is Pay 2 Win, there are you occasional hackers, gold in silver servers, and all that jazz, this is prehaps one of the best games I have ever played. I remember staying up till 5 in the morning playing, either pwning with the starter which is secretly op, or getting rekted by bought guns which should really be nerfed. You should try it out and see if you can put up with the unfair disadvantages I once had to put up with.
5404	0	a	THE GAME WAS HORRIBLE IT WAS A DISCRACE TO ALL GAMES AND IS ANOTHER RIP OFF OF GTA
8982	0	a	Piece of brown turd with even more shades of â¥â¥â¥â¥ brown and stiff gameplay. Controls like a nightmare. All I wanted was Fallout 3 MMO &gt;:O
8771	0	a	I was banned for literally no reason.
4862	0	a	its like if grand theft auto had a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ baby.
7208	0	a	this game is f*cken â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, no wonder it was free.. Download time took forever, Load time..eternity.. Worst game ever. save yourself the time.
8223	0	a	&gt;Game crashes on startup &gt;Still keeps running according to my profile &gt;Actually have 49 hours of playtime when I dont even know how the game looks like TOPKEK
3455	1	a	Yes it totally Worth it For Free
6348	0	a	look only at the negative comments on this game dont listen to the positive one's.
10071	1	a	Fallen earth is a exremelly good tps/fps game that is sort of post-apocalptic (excuse bad spelling). i dont really know/remember the main objetive. but you are a clone that is needing to change part of this world due to an apocalypse.
6744	0	a	Don't bother downloading this pay2win, full of cheaters piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9868	1	a	I have started playing this game this week and have found it to be a enjoyable one. the game is much like fallout if you liked that game then you would enjoy. the graphics are ok but i find that this gives this game a diffrent feel and in away the fact theat their not amazing has given it a diffrent look and aspect and me personal enjoye this about it as now a days its all about the graphics and this gives a brake from that. thir seems to be a problem with the landscape loading and then doesent buffer as well as not a frecent movement seem to be laggey ( friends have had same problem) but besides that what i have played so far is enjoyable. i would recomend this game to people who enjoy games like fallout.hope you have the same enjoyment i have had and i hope it continuse thought the game for me
10472	0	a	It is a great game that makes the aftermat of the apocalypse seem enjoyable with your friends and other people online. This game is great on the RPG side as well as the fact that its free to play is really a good spot for those who just wants to play games without no strings attached.  BUUUUUT the gtame is dead so yeah....I wish people would've seen this game when it was in its early days...it was like the poor man's Fallout 3...Because is was FREE
5148	0	a	A broke un-fair piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.......yet i keep going back to it, I don't recommend you get it because it's addicting, and you don't want to get addicted to this â¥â¥â¥â¥, it is extremely pay to win, save yourself the time and go play a decent game guys!
8595	0	a	Supports are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Truht :  https://gyazo.com/327ad94bfca280b5b48fc9e30d02c465 
1844	1	a	Its epic 
7170	0	a	Fastest and most efficient way to obtain terminal autism
6831	0	a	i wish i could of played it but it was having dumb and not necessary issues
1111	1	a	Server is kinda shaky here and there but overall its a good game! *Important get a INTEL processor to run this game stresses a lot  on Processing power. Edit: 11/4/15 : Server performance is great getting 1ms latency.
8687	0	a	Well... this is a game and should not take it seriously but back to the topic I, ve been playing this game for quite some time and i would say this is an ok game. It used to be really bad but past couple of weeks they improved this game a lot and there is no P2W wep they are all reskins. most of the hackers are gone and server will get engine update soon so right now this game is good but then again if you re willing to spend money then make sure you have lots cuz this games sucks it like a bat since one reskin costs around $30.  Take it back: this game is sht
6117	0	a	at least the uninstall function works properly
8133	0	a	Worst game ever unless you got a big wallet! DONT PLAY IT!
7330	0	a	Repetitive, buggy, poorly balanced, and terribly optimized. I suggest taking a pass on this one.
5274	0	a	this game takes your money like an insurance company claims tax.
2997	1	a	People say this game is Pay To Win... But it's not, when i started to play this game i killed people that had Payed items which wasn't that difficult, However if you save money like me you can get really cool and good stuff from the shops in the game. For example if you spend real money on to the game its just giving stuff that looks better and its upgraded little bit too. I played this game for few hours and i am so close to get a really good car without spending no real life money. Hope this changed your mind about this game. :)
231	1	a	the game is messing upits not letting me in i press play game it dont play whats going on
377	1	a	I played this game with 3 of my friends. All of us rage quitted atleast once.  Now my friends don't wanna play anymore :(  0/5 Pay to Win 5/5 Game 3/5 Overall After playing this game for so long, my doctor told me I'm a sadist.
9286	0	a	welcome 2 update simulator. so first lets update. 2 hours later (in-game time doesn't work propperly) let's start. i was very excited and then it happend. error..... so let's try again. error again. so don't waste your time.
6932	0	a	Its a fun game and all until.......... -Massive pay to win game -â¥â¥â¥â¥ customor service -money hungry -â¥â¥â¥â¥ community aghhh you get the point, its another pay to win game  My story  After playing over 150 hours ( on my other account ) i was in a match and i got a 20 kill streak, dammm i was on fire until these group of 12 year olds complained and reported me for hacking...l got banned!  Support was â¥â¥â¥â¥, all they did was send me a auto message that had nothing to do with my problem  DONT GET THIS UNLESS YOUR 12 AND CAN USE YOUR MUMS CARDS TO PAY TO WIN
6168	0	a	This game is too old need upgrade charaters,graphics and cars XD
9434	0	a	crashes on loading screen. i have the specs. game got the bugs.
9501	1	a	The Fallen Earth its like DayZ
4921	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.
4539	0	a	Pretty bad game, gets really repetitive and boring, the shooting is kind of off... But it has great customization. Must put a lot of money or a ton of time into the game to really get something out of it. Used to be a great game... used to....
9928	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
2536	1	a	cooooool nice games of open world games
4868	0	a	It dosent even let me play the game correctly
10223	1	a	Wow. Very cool game. Kind of rough and crude, but honestly feels like Fallout 1 in FPS.
5124	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!!!!! DO NOT PLAY! I REPEAT DO NOT PLAYYY!!!
10011	0	a	I decided to play this game in the good faith of APB's Succes (IMO) And to even put this game under the name of GamersFirst Is a big mistake! I thought this would be THE Fallout online thing, boy oh boy was I wrong xD... You start off as a dude underground, some â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens, you die and Wake up again, being told that you're a clone, You go out of the chosen bunker and die to everything because the only thing you got is a freaking paintball gun.... Jesus  Alas I played it for about 30 hours before steam and let me just tell you right now Nothing is gonna happen I wandered for so long collecting ressourses only to find out I needed half a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on more of something to craft anything And when I finally got those damn things it took me about 3 hours to craft.... this game, brings depression!
7101	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
376	1	a	i havent played it bu ive seen my friends play it and i recommend you to play it its awesome! belive me :D thx! 
3588	1	a	Car Smashing Griefing Simulator whichever year. Of course there is more than that to this game. You buy clothes, you buy cars, you buy guns and feel fabulous about yourself, but all that comes with real world money or countless hours spent in this game. Is it worth your time you ask? Well if smashing low tier cars into high tier super cars until they explode until you get reported is your cup of tea, by all means create a bald naked fat guy and go ram everyone in the street. Also cherish the time introducing your friends to the game and finding them as disappointed about the community as you are.
2462	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME! this game is beautiful, you can create your own cars and characters, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT! APB Reloaded is one of those games where 80% of people have spent alot of money buying cars and weapons which are OP, this makes the game hard to play at times because you are put up against people who can kill you with one shot. it would be cool if you could choose to verse people that are your level and have the same guns as you, so you are not getting demolished by the people who pay to win. But if you dont mind getting killed with one shot well this is the game for you! It is fun to just get your car and Drag Race your friends or Random people, and cause Havoc on the streets with you Dump Truck, speeding along the roads blowing up everything in your path. I would rate this game a 8/10 because of its massive selection of cars and weapons, and the amount of fun you can have with it!
4050	0	a	Great ideas, awful implementation and balance. Not worth the headache.   Just play GTA4 or Saints Row with a friend for a way better experience.
7147	0	a	Spent the last 3 hours tring too install its 'Game Files' and it can't even run the application.. I recieved a Steam Error when it tried to run.. Don't download, the game makes your download a lot of other bloatware which the game itself doesn't need.
5333	0	a	Ruled by hackers, laggy and Pay2Win, need I say more?
471	1	a	If you like hackers, getting owned by people with more experience and bandits vs cops, then this game is for you.
7879	0	a	Game is fun...for a while then it just goes down to who pays more and has the better weapons. You cna kinda try to defend yourself but in the end. P2P &gt; F2P
6102	0	a	why the hack is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing working!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!%^&amp;^%^&amp;*#68264
5045	0	a	This is the best time wasting game I have ever played. If you have a few hours to kill, you could do the tutorial and then just simply uninstall this game just like I did. The graphics are strong, but the game is lacking somewhat, far too much lag. I shot someone direct in the head, and they died 10 seconds later. They moaned first, then fell over, and then died, bluh.  Do yourself a favour and leave this game alone, it just ain't up to what it says on the tin. GTA wanabee, but GTA it will never be.
6987	0	a	its not as fun as they make it out to be
5110	0	a	I am going to compare this to GTA Online or Saints Row as it is that style of gameplay  1. Acess to fun:  GTA Online, I have to boot up the game, click on online, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  Saints Row, I have to boot up the game, join a friend, start the game, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  In APB Reloaded, I have to boot up the start menu, update the game, start up the game itself (Which sometimes opens up a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Facebook 'like this' page and you have to click Start again), Then select the character, then join the correct district then select the spawn and then have no idea where to go because you selected the wrong district and have no idea where to go.  Character Customisation:  In GTA Online it is the worst character creation ever, you choose the grandparents and parents and that's how your characer looks like, no wonder my character looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t  In Saints Row 3 and 4 the customisation is great. It leaves enough options to be extremely customizable but few enough to be simple  In APB Reloaded it is like Saints Row but the camera angles are confusing, the advanced mode gives too many options while the quick mode gives too little options. It is the worst of both worlds.  And that's as much of the game I know of. As it took too long to get any-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-where with the game as it was complicated and boring to figure out where to go.
9229	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.  iv only payed like 0,5 hours but it sucks more than â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blockade. i do not know how you can play this game, i saw a guy in the reviews that had played for 3900 hours... WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ it must be the creator of the game.
5482	0	a	Imagine GTA online. You got it? Now take the fun out of it. Yeah, that's APB Reloaded.
4419	0	a	Not working to mac :(  Pay 2 win game xD.
9774	0	a	I can't even log in!!!
3950	0	a	Grind fest with tons of hackers.
8629	0	a	This game is an awesome idea,but there is just too many mistakes made in it.  First of all its complicated,atleast it was for me. No real tutorial rather than text. Pro players in starter area. Glitches. Pay to win.
3786	0	a	APB 2012 Veteran with a level 255 gold enforcer and a 180-190 rank Crim. I know what I'm talking about. I have about 400 hours on my main steam account followed by about 1000-1200 on my G1 Launcher account. A good 400-500$ down the drain unfortunately   The Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game  - The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined. I'm just speechless.  - Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of San Paro is no doubt griefers  ' The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer ' - a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer  - The last 15 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update  - I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the â¥â¥â¥â¥in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.  - Corrupt developers. Proof :         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Revoemag the corrupt GM&nbsp;
129	1	a	This game is awsome and people should play it for the folllowing reasons :  1 : Pure PvP makes you jump out of your seat and also breakes your mouse :'(  2 : awsome worled with a varity of places and varity of districts. 3 : cool graphiques and awsome sound tracks (not like GTA ) and the D audio is perfect. 4 : Your character, clothes, vehicles, and even your music may be customized to fit your playstyle. and about the bad things : 1 : Bad matchmaking puts you againest HARDCORE players . 2 : Lags even if u have a latancy of 40 ms.  3 : a game that will break your PC.
3491	1	a	The has its problems, but what game doesn't. Overall a fun experince
10487	1	a	Fun game I recommend it because it will keep you busy for hours and its like a poor mans Fallout
4873	0	a	pay to play . no freedom on symbols , clothes, cars u need pay for all ............ 1,3,15,30 or more day unless ur limited at 3,7 symbols per cloth,car..... HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!
6259	0	a	For the love of god, don't do missions. In my experience there's a lot of P2W out there. Although the customization and the worlds are great, the PvP makes ArcheBlade look easy.
5415	0	a	this game is ballshit  
2205	1	a	Good and fun game just one problem, too many overpowered weapons and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, take that out and the game is great.
6293	0	a	I've +500 hours (without steam) and i can easily say that devs don't care anymore. They don't try to keep cheats away. They just ban the ones using 'DETECTED' cheats. That isn't instant so they just open new accounts and keep cheating. Also you can pay for cheat. It is called 'ARMAS MARKETPLACE'. You can buy some weapons that is equal to cheat. You won't get banned for that though. By the way, when there is a patch i would get excited. I thought they will bring something new and good for the game. Every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time i check the updates, I see more overpowered weapons and more bugs. Game is done for me.
8960	1	a	its weird hard to understand the mechanics but its pretty good if you figure it out i repeat if you (figure It out)
2150	1	a	Hit the streets as a licensed vigilante or hardened criminal in the crime-ravaged metropolis of San Paro where shootouts, car-chases, robbery, and vandalism are all in a day's work. Prove yourself to your chosen organization and you could earn fame, deadly weapons, exotic vehicles, and stylish new clothing; fail.But is too cool
72	1	a	Ok Well It's Pretty Fun Trying to get money and buy new clothes :/ thats it...
4634	0	a	Unfortunately I'm going to have to say this with a heavy heart. I do not recommend APB Reloaded. I put a lot of hours into this game and while it can be irritating it is really fun; but here's the kicker: once you're leveled up enough you then deal with hackers. In order to continue to play and actually have any decent fun, you need to hack yourself. It sounded dumb and at first and I did not believe the person who told me so I kept playing. But over the next couple of days I realized he was right. Not only do the players hack but while I played all the servers were hacked as well and these actions made it almost unplayable. The idea is great and the gameplay is great; but all the constant hacking done do this game ruins the fun. If it weren't for the hackers I'd highly recommend this game.
918	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
1914	1	a	it deos take a long time to download but after you have tryed clicking play and all the other bits and bobs of clicking then it might work or it might not but saying all of this i would recommend this game because when you get the game starter the graphics are nt bad but the only things that dissapoint me is that it takes a while to start when you first get it and the game is quiet confusing for example how to change your outfit or how to upgrade on certain stuff like a gun or a car it is quiet hard but you do get a tutorial and when you drive car it is quiet glichy that might just be me im not sure but over all i would recommend this game  soz for quiet alot of negitive comments apb reloaded but i have to write a review on what i think
1697	1	a	Beast multiplayer if you play with friends!
8643	0	a	Never in my life have thought that potential is the only good aspect of a game. The environment is toxic, not so much the people but due the fact that after 3 years of playing I've determined that this is not a 3de person shooter but competitive credit card swiping or job creation for your friendly neighborhood hacker. In essence this game is only fun after a patch for the first 10 or so hours.
703	1	a	I started it up and tried to play it. Then I spilt coffee on my keyboard and it became unplayable. 2/29%
704	1	a	APB: Reloaded used to be really pay-to-win, but somehow they fixed it. You can customize your car, clothes and character. Vehicles and weapons have mods to them. Its a subscription kind of deal, you hire guns with in game money for 14 days. The guns with mods on them already aren't that expansive. It is expansive though to customize your own package.  You can short cut the system by buying the guns/vehicles with mods with actual money. Buying premium will double the exp and in game money you get.  Overall friendly community. You can easily play without friends with the auto group system. Full servers, more criminals then enforcers though. I recommend choosing the enforcer.
3604	1	a	This Game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AWSOME! 
5439	0	a	This game is a half baked GTA clone. The worlds are tiny and for some reason everyone is a scenester. The physics are and GUI make this game look like it was made in the early 00's.   2/10 would not recomend.
442	1	a	Cool Game !
6436	0	a	I once loved this game, now i feel ashamed. This game had promise but ended up in development hell. They spent 100$+ million on this game and this is the results of a game with idiotic planning and promise. If they focused more on clan/faction battles AND pvp this may just been a little better.   Rest in peace 2011-2014 \'Pay2win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you\'
1826	1	a	This game is awesome fun to play can be easy and can be hard i reomend this game for 13+
2992	1	a	
2600	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played! Highly recommended for everyone! It's level of customization is too good to be true. It's amazing! I can't get enough of it!
4588	0	a	Greetings,  Here we find the explanation of development and how it's supposed to and not-to work. Here we see a great concept, but the game's amongst one of the poorest methods of executions. It's been floating around for about 6-years, it's dissapeared and re-appeared, regardless; not much has changed on it. It's free-to-play, so if you wish to give it a try, go ahead. It's a fun game with friends, sadly it looks too much like a money-grabbin' development team but no clue do I have. Either way, recently as of 2016 mentions of new directions &amp; paths for this game to embark have been set, but this promise has been made many times (2011-2016) through many formerly responsible people of APB's development, administration &amp; moderation team. But let's hope it takes the right way into further growth.  Kindest regards, Nick.
7415	0	a	Most broken game i have played!  performance is â¥â¥â¥â¥, uses ages to load anything, have to use 48x AA to fully use the gpu, and you're stuck with 75 fps the pvp is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t as mission makes you face people with rpg's that instakill you or snipers while new players are stuck with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ assault rifles and a pistol with barely any damage.
3239	1	a	Really good free to play game and Specially if u like shoot guns and drive cars designe cars designe a caracther or more!
4535	0	a	Boring, Shooting Mechanics Barley work, Concept is awesome and needs to be recreated in other games, but you need a better engine, better company, and better gameplay. Words said, waiting for actions
2342	1	a	Very fun with friends! Please try this! 
2097	1	a	Amazing game, defenately worth a try. However, preapare to grind a little for good items.

569	1	a	The game is absolutely incredible. I've read a lot of negative reviews, but I believe most of them aren't justified. People call the game 'unfair' to new players. But seriously, the game is no different than any MMORPG out there, you can't start a character on level 1 and expect to kill level 100 players. The difference is a lot smaller though, I've made 17 kills in a mission versus top-level opponents as soon as I started playing the game, with only starter weapons. Other complains are that it's 'pay to win', which is also untrue. Basically premium only helps you speed up the process and get money faster to buy weapons, also unlocks more customization options. However the premium doesn't even affect the gameplay, it's mostly like an EXP boost which are being sold in most MMO's. Other complains are that the game is dying. Actually the community is slowly starting to grow back. It gained 16% more players just this month, so the game isn't really dying at all. Some districts are so crowded that it gets even annoying. Another complain is that the community sucks and people are teamkilling eachother. Basically it's no different than CS:GO. When you kill more than 5 teammates you get kicked from the game, so I don't see a problem here.  The only thing that I agree with the negative reviews are that the game lags. A lot. I cover up the recommended requirements all the way, yet the game still lags on low graphic time to time. I still don't know what's the problem, but even with lag I can't help it, but enjoy the game. It's just awesome. Tons of customizations, tons of fun, cars, weapons .. everything. I hope the devs do something about the lag issue, then I will count it as the best f2p game ever.
4232	0	a	Yeah... no Headshots and all the premium weapons shoot faster and hit harder. Hackers are a problem as well. Avoid.
10277	1	a	10 out of 10, since it was released in 2009 still one of the best post-apocalyptic MMORPG of all time! I recommend for anyone who likes Fallout or similar games and for every people who wants a new taste of mmorpg! The graphics are not as the same as a new released mmorpg but the gameplay and the roleplay is magnificent! Try it out, and have fun!

125	1	a	A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out. I playing this game for a while now and i'm still loving it! For beginners is it in the beginning of the game very frustrating that you gonna play against very good players. But when u play alot u will become good 2. :) (sorry for my bad english)
9621	1	a	Never played game, writes review. 10/10 wouldent play again?
3017	1	a	It's decent now that it's free and I HIGHLY reccommend you play with friends rather than alone.  Customization options are still awesome, though you're limited if you've got a free account. Not to say that you can't create something awesome with that though ;)  Of the free to play games I've played, the gun play in this game is great. It feels responsive enough to pull off pop-shots and quick swipes across your mousepad.  As for the guns themselves keep in mind that different weapons fill different roles. The game might not do a great job of teaching you what to do off the bat but it's fairly simple once you get used to it. i.e.: A SMG or shotgun will generally lose at range to an assault rifle; Assault rifles are good all-around. The starting rifle (STAR 556) is not to be underestimated, you can definitely outplay other 'paid'/'armas' guns with the right strategy.  Speaking of strategy, it plays a HUGE role in the game. A bit too much to explain in a little box here, but just remember to use the camera/third-person-view to your advantage, remember to check your flanks, and remember to stay in cover. As with any shooter, you'll have to learn the maps for the advantages each area holds, and how to counter them, how to flank them.   Once again, gaming is always fun with a friend, and for free? Sure, why not.

3566	1	a	A lot of people overlooked this game in the beginning. It's free to play now, although you can spend a little cash to get some more customization. This is downright devilish in how fun it is to play together. Get it now! Lets play!
568	1	a	Sure APB Reloaded has it's up's &amp; down's but personly I recomend this 3rd person shooter for anyone who like's PVP game's. You might feel like you suck but after you play it for a few hour's you will get used to it so before you give up, give it a try and see what you think.
3409	1	a	I miss this game, gonna have to start playing again!

9651	1	a	i love this game 
6590	0	a	Until they fix the matchmaking in this game and allow new players a chance to progress without having to fight rank 200 gold threat players, this game is a disaster. I applaud the attempts at trying to prevent cheating, but the game is highly out of balance. You will start out with basic equipment and little understanding of the game and immediately face off against the most highly equipped players that know the layouts and have amazing accuracy.   While this game has mass potential and could be a very solid shooter, the people running the game have virtually removed the player base and removed any and all chances of attracting new players to the game threfore giving this game no real evolution. It simply dies off from the start for new players, and older players like myself alike. If one day the matchmaking systems and servers are more balanced, this could be an awsome game but for now, it gets 2 stars out of 5.

6924	0	a	Some good things about the game :  - Best character creator I've ever seen  - Nice take on cops and robbers  - Great ways to customize clothing and vehicles  - You can create your own music  - Wide range of weapons and clothes  - Gameplay is fun for a while  - 2 reasonably big maps to play on  - Great leveling system  *Instead of actual levels, you level up contracts, that will reward you with new vehicles, clothing, weapons, customization options, and new contacts to level up.    Some bad things about the game :  -The game has a P2W (Pay-to-Win) feel to it  *Great weapons cost real money and are very overpowered compared to the in-game weapons  - F2P weapons are very similar  *Several of the same weapon, with different buffs  - FPS isn't very smooth unless you have a good PC  - Driving is a bit slow, reactions are off  *Turning has a very slight delay after pressing the key  - Absolutely terrible ranking system  *The game's 'Threat Level' is basically a ranking to show off your skill in matches.  *The game has districts dedicated for each rank (Gold, silver bronze) but players of that rank aren't forced to join one of those servers, resulting in a high amount of golds in silver districts (Very little, if any, silvers), and many golds/silvers in bronze districts (Few bronzes). This makes it hard for bronzes and silvers to level up.   The game is fun overall but being P2W ruins it for me. I don't know if many others have had a similar issue, but whenever the game is installed to my pc, it slows down my performance overall, but goes away once uninstalled. The game's worth trying out, but don't expect for it to be the greatest thing ever.
1867	1	a	It is great for free roaming with friends but anything outside of that is pure pay to win and is not recommended.

6746	0	a	This game it's so annoying you are playing you are killing some enemys and then there is a guy that he has given his soul to this game and you are hitting him over and over again and you spend 1 million bullets hitting and he is still allive and he is only looking at you and he is killing you!! Just do not play this game trust me !!!!!!NEVER!!!!!!
8914	1	a	Fallen Earth is a very fun and unique game, it has a lot of features such as mining rocks and scavaging in rubbish piles...with the copper you mine from rocks you can craft into bullets. You can also lvl up geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.
8861	0	a	World is not interesting, enemies are not interesting, dungeons are boring with bullet sponge bosses. The end game pvp is borderline pay2win with the way the shop works. The combat is aim/action based but still uses spammy hotkey skills. Overall the combat is worse than WoWs style due to how horrible the animation and unbalanced the skills are. The crafting takes a long time to do unless you pump money into the game. You can straight up buy the best vehicle in the game, and you have to buy a item to craft the best weapons. This is not fallout the mmo, this is a sad attempt to milk fallout fans.  I have a lot of time in it from pressure by friends to play it. Same reason WoW still has so many subs who don't actually like the game much, they play it as a social experience. Also have a lot of time simply from being AFK. The best way to level is waiting in a place called Citadel. Also crafting is only viable if you AFK in game next to a bought crafting table.
2478	1	a	This game is pretty fun for free it's very good. The customization has a wide variety from things to choose and unlock from. If you are interested into a free roaming fun time download this.

985	1	a	okay, so, i dont have many hours but i will say this, it is a hit or miss game with the public so here is a list of pros and cons as of 2/23/2016 pros: the community is alot better now that bans have been handed down over waves and such, the graphics are great for a free to play and game play is simple to learn but hard to master considerably less hackers, still out there, but i see at least five banned every day by this new system 'fair fight' awsome custom jobs and such, and amazing artwork in and out of game, and awsome player made clothing and charectars to boot, (yes, even enforcers love the way some crims stylise  now that the pros are over, he are some cons  1. hackers, still, not as much, but still there 2. PAY TO WIN, gamers first prides themselves on allowing people to have a amazing fun time, even when your loosing, but 'why is this a con?' i hear you ask? because gamers first, like any other company, like jagex and blizzard, loooooooooooooooooooooooooove money, gamers first is just a bit more open about it, they cater to the rich with awsome cars and weapons, that to have them permantly, you have to pay around 20-30$ usd to buy, and in this game, they almost force you to buy them with irl cash, which brings me onto number 3. 3. expiring weapons, after 7-10 days, your weapon you bought from your contacts is unusable, no reason why, just it, if you ever wanna have a good perm gun, your gonna need to fork over some cash. 4. community moderation, No, i dont mean 'oh admin where are you, this guy is hacking' moderation, i mean fourm moderation, gamers first doesnt really have that great of a customer service really, just a few copy and pasted anwsers most of the time, but hell, most game comapny's do this,  so, in the end, my rating would be. 7/10
4949	0	a	the matchmaking system is bad the higer level players are often placed with low lovel players me my self am a low level bronze player and i often get placed with gold players. can the game develepers please fix the matchmaking system plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

5477	0	a	Bad. Boring, unbalanced, unoriginal, ugly, lazy, I cannot stress how bad this game is. Server problems aside, this is just, one of the WORST games, no wait, one of the worst FREE games, of all time. It's confusing, there's just about no tutorials to be found, the story is missing, the character creation is pretty lame. There is NO PVE, which wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't P2W. There is nothing good to be found here, this beats big rigs, this game actually tried really hard to be good, and failed. The only reason it gets a 2, is because it's playable, not that you'd want to play it though. 2/10.
4737	0	a	I bought this game when it was just APB with Realtime Worlds.  It was frustrating then but enough people played to make it mostly enjoyable. I decided to give it another go and I just can't even get a foothold.  It's an uphill battle the whole way. Max rank, gold threat opposition every single game. Me and the sad team the matchmaking system would scrounge up for me would get trounced every game without fail.  You either have to buy some better gear (which I get the sense they count on), find a team that's good or slog through the grind until you can compete.  Long story short, this game is NOT beginner friendly.  I also need to add that the 'microtransaction' system is nothing close to micro. In fact, to purchase a gun it costs $20 upwards. That's just a single gun. They've taken the notion of a free to play system and add ons that are cheap and gone crazy.  They incentivise it at every turn as well. It's an impossible grind to obtain items unless you buy them. In many games you almost have to have the purchased weapons in order to compete when the other team is packing them. I'm sure most people would rather just buy a game outright and have everything the game has to offer, or at the very least not pay a price for additional content that rivals what a normal game's price would be to begin with.  It's a shameful, obvious cash grab. I would buy something if the prices weren't so outrageous. This system has strangled and alienated the community at a steady rate. I'd be surprised if within 2 years this game is still alive as a result.  ...Not to imply that the current community population could be considered 'alive.'
10293	1	a	Great Game, could use a little reboot and the system is a little old, so its good just has a lack of detail.

852	1	a	I recommend you look for the top Recommendation notes for this game, Personaly I think this game is awesome!
10381	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
10070	1	a	This game was fun but far too slow for me to really get into a lot I gave it a bit of time but the progression was just way too slow for me I felt as if I was playing WoW and the tutorial system was just as bad as WoW's when I tried this game though even with that all being said the game looked great and it showed a lot of promise.   While this type of game isnt for some people myself included I would still recommend it just for the fact that the game itself doesnt feel lieks ome kind of horrible ten minute made on a low budget game. The quality of this game is amazing and the simple fact that its free makes it all that much better I don't understand why so many people have a mixed view of this game but I am sure its in part to the fact that the community wasnt very nice to new players.
8341	0	a	The ranking system is crap. You can't rank to gold without being put abck to silver even after a win streak. They don't ban hackers. Don't play this game.

2091	1	a	Originally released in summer 2010, published by EA and developed by the now defunct RealTime Worlds, APB is a competitive 3rd Person Shooter Sandbox Massively Multiplayer Online Game with rich character customization as one of it's primary features. Now in the hands of GamersFirst and Reloaded Productions, APB has been relaunched as APB: Reloaded, aiming to enhance the original, and expand on content. APB can be a fun game in short bursts, but will quickly become frustrating with it's steep difficulty curve and dependance on better gear, obtained either with ingame currency or through the ARMAS Market (Cash Shop). The system requirements are also painful if you wish to play on the highest settings, however, the requirements have been reduced in order to appeal to a larger market than when it launched in summer 2010. Despite my less than glowing review, I still recommend that you at least try this game.
10171	0	a	Not very good. Even for free. Not worth the time.
1777	1	a	Want the most fun out of your f2p experience? PLay a criminal and don't do missions. You'll make plenty of money and not have to worry about level 1's with a '+10 Sniper Rifle of Colon Obliteration'. Plus hey, you can beat up civies and drive a fedex truck. Wat's not to like?

2867	1	a	good game with vehicles,thiefs,cops,and arsenal but some weapons are with real money so if u realy wana be good game is pay to win
8308	0	a	I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game 3 times, I am not very good at FPS but the it seems like the only people who play this game have perfect 100% accuracy and they can tell when I am coming around corners its amazing and frustrating. I reccomend not even playing this game as you will have fun up until you hit those types of players that just absolutely know where you are and can kill you in seconds with hard shots, crazy game super fun but i dont believe in the anti cheat system of this game.
3019	1	a	If you can stick with the HUGE learning curve this game has, this is a real gem. The biggest problem with the game is the community. Find some nice friends in game, or a clan, talk to NOONE else, even turn off district chat. The shooting is fun, the missions are fun, the driving is fun. The game progression is OK, but slow, unless you have Premium.  I suggest if you like the game to get Premium, it's much more enjoyable ( for me at least ) to see progression happening at least daily, or semi-daily.  This game has VERY few aspects of P2W IF any ( arguable ), so as a F2P player, you can really keep up as well, but it's just slower to progress with contacts.  Again, if you can take the learning curve, and the community, it's a fun game.

6729	0	a	Fairfight? FAIRFIGHT?! Yeah, sure, if you consider a fair fight a team of gold threat players going up against a team of new guys/girls, then sure, but for MOST people, it's horrid! How does anyone expect to advance if these matches happen every single time? GamersFirst would be better off making the game singleplayer or co-op, in my opinion, and don't even get me started on the pay-to-win part, I'm not gonna waste my time complaing about that because no one would listen in the first place. And as I'mst looking at these other reviews, I see the same thing, Horrid matchmaking, Pay-to-win, and the only good thing being great customization.  Do NOT waste your time and money with this â¥â¥â¥â¥, I've been with APB since it's beta stages, and I say that I have a better chance stumbling on a long abandoned diamond mine in the middle of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ocean than actually progressing without paying a cent to APB.
8128	0	a	This game used to be one of my favorite games of all time. I've spent hundreds of hours playing, but lately the developers seem to be milking the players for all they're worth. They release new 'legendary' guns almost monthly, which can only be won with a 1% chance by opening Joker Mystery Boxes (They cost $1 a pop).   Also, their balance team doesn't seem to know how to properly balance the in-game weapons. At the time of writing, they are trying to balance them by introducing some wonky recoil mechanics on all of their guns it seems. The servers are absolute trash and you'll notice, even with the new servers, constant stuttering or warping, and mind you I play on a rather great PC.  The community has absolutely no regulation. There are no GMs patrolling the districts so you can expect a lot of foul language, hate speech, harassment and angry whisper messages from other players. With the exception of new guns or cars (AKA Cash Grabs), there has been no new content added to the game since the game's inception in 2008. There are only two playable districts and a couple of fight clubs and that is all you'll ever see in this game are these maps.  I can not recommend this game in good faith. Hopefully things change drastically, but I doubt that will happen with the way the current developers and team are handling this game.

If you enjoy lifeless worlds, horrible driving, imbalanced weapons, a cancerous 'community' and glitchy gameplay this game is a must. Otherwise, don't even bother. The character customisation isn't even worth it.
8800	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, please dont, just dont.
10495	1	a	It suck serious â¥â¥â¥ 
8484	0	a	There is no such thing as headshots on this game. Shoot a guy in the head with a sniper and he will laugh and kill you with an automatic rifle while you reload. It seems like every window on the cars are bulletproof. The physics of this game are so messed up.   There is rarely any PvE which is fine. All your missions will be done against the opposition. This makes it hard for a beginner to get sold into the game especially when you have all the seasoned players crowding the newbie district. The tutorial is poor and doesn't explain some of the important mechanics like how to aim-outside-the-window of your buddy's car while he is driving. The elitist get mad when you don't play the game how they want you to play it. Its like they have their own little code of conduct.   I was looking for a clone to replace GTA but I guess I would rather play GTA instead. If you are expecting this game to be an alternative to GTA then you will be disappointed. The only thing this game has going for it is the customization(character, music playlist, guns, cars, and etc). Other than that, the game will make you mad and wish it would improve. Game has potential but the mechanics just are not fit for me.
1518	1	a	it's really what gta online should have been if it weren't for sharkcard shilling and rockstar being literal autism

1909	1	a	This is probably one of the best F2P games ive ever seen or played. Just the graphics and customization alone are jawdroping.The game base of crims vs cops is something somewhat new at this level.     Very lovely game ,  keep up the good work!!
9477	1	a	God i love to shoot nuclear monsters with a paintball gun
1598	1	a	:)
8523	0	a	i used to love this game, but coming back to it now i see its just another grindy steaming pile of p2w garbage. the only way to actually beat any missions is either rent expensive better weapons (you cant actually keep the good ones as they expire) or hope the enemy team is too busy killing you to actually do the objectives. you can grind money for better gear but it takes forever with the tiny payouts, and theres always going to be that jackass with his parent's credit card running around with all the good â¥â¥â¥â¥. importing music is just terrible as it usually auto-deletes any copyrighted song so i have to wonder why that feature is even there. the lag is horrid, makes it hardly playable. The game's clothes and vehicle customization is the best thing about it, but getting good looking stuff requires you to unlock and max out huge strings of npc experience, for basic items like shirts and masks, which wouldn't be bad if doing so wasn't tedious. decals are also limited unless you get the premium.  long story short; if your looking for a terrible, generic p2w game you found it.
2738	1	a	I like this game alot.
3563	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.
5380	0	a	1/10 would never play again
2048	1	a	its cool but not that cool 
3672	1	a	This game is openworld kind of game which give u the freedome to do anything. The game customazation of this game is really good which when u can customize ur character or ur own personal car in anytime u want. U can see my custimazation on my screenshot uploads and u will see how u can totally customize any thing in your own. The gameplay of the mission is good. U have to have teamwork so u can win the game. the game is third personshooter and use it to know where the ally or the enemies are. BIG THUMBS UP FOR THIS GAME!
2022	1	a	Even though this game is like grand theft auto it has missions,clans and other things.
9896	0	a	NOT GOOD AT ALL
2873	1	a	I like tha game....kinda like GTA but its not at the same time.

7250	0	a	Used to be fun :( Community=toxic Devs=money hungry Waste of time and money to play it now.
8699	0	a	Updates are ruining it, bad tutorial, multipayer is almost dead.
2592	1	a	APB reloaded is an action packed game. It is full of suprises and is so random it's kind of funny.
5167	0	a	When you first start the game very hard. Even mid-hard. Once under stress and, it will be BIow. Bye ~ bye ~ bye ~.
3711	1	a	This game is actually pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good.  It takes a lot of practice, consistent playing &amp; willingness to learn and adapt to its unique brand of combat but once you do, especially with a few friends, you can kick so much â¥â¥â¥â¥. There is nothing more satisfying than outplaying a team of hackers simply because you have better mapknowledge &amp; practiced skill with the unique weapon systems.  I think one of the biggest things that throws people off is the idea that guns only deal damage at certain ranges, too many times do I see an NTEC 5 user shooting an enemy at 80m+ and wondering why he doesn't get a kill.
3364	1	a	Very Addicting funny game. Nice for playing with friends. I recomend it to everyone (of coure above 18). 
341	1	a	Get this game
9707	0	a	Not even worth downloading. Its impossible to play 5 minutes without it freezing up your computer. I even set a timer on it. It actually freezes after exactly 5 minutes of gameplay. Wierd.
5065	0	a	doesnt load for abou ten mins the doesnt work
6027	0	a	tried it out for a couple of minutes. didnt really like it.
697	1	a	Yeah, That's A Rich Gang Game
1466	1	a	A bad MMO and a bad third person shooter, with amazing customization. Bareable for a little while and fun for even less, but is a decent waste of your time; especially while listening to a podcast.
7849	0	a	pay 2 win and terrible community
924	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
6651	0	a	Pay to Win. Veterans prey on new players. â¥â¥â¥â¥ community. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
7528	0	a	apb reloaded your visa gift card sweety *buys more gay â¥â¥â¥â¥ and an aimbot* wow i guess this game is fun...lol not..
2786	1	a	even tho their are hackers this game is great fun just to mess around on the phusics are comical i love this game
2915	1	a	game is good i really like it but we need a Australian Server or something as i get a huge lag and makes it hard for me to play.
550	1	a	5 years ago, and still love it
2063	1	a	its ok
3373	1	a	To be honest I do really like the game but it is more of a pay to win game since you need to buy weapons with real money to actually own them forever, other than that it's great.
4979	0	a	A broke un-fair piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.......yet i keep going back to it, I don't recommend you get it because it's addicting, and you don't want to get addicted to this â¥â¥â¥â¥, it is extremely pay to win, save yourself the time and go play a decent game guys!
8964	1	a	I Honestly Enjoyed this Game , alittle thing w are all looking for , crafting , uniqueness in character customization, contruction , PVP , And a great storyline that satifies all of us RPG-pvp loving fanatics, i haven't played that long yet, but so far its very smooth and has really good graphics. no bugs of my knowledge , Props to the Devs on this one :D
2475	1	a	I like this game. I really do. If any of you want to play it as a cop please let me know because sadly it is a game that takes more than one person to play right.
4760	0	a	I can't play the game because it says it's running. I wouldn't reccomend it only if you know how to fix it or you wanna be frustrated
7686	0	a	* Brutal to new players * Laggy and unoptimized * Rampent Cheaters that make life a living hell. * Inactive Devs and GM's * DDoS attacked frequently.  If GamersFirst Developers became more transparent and seemed like they cared about their customers I would come back to this game after they fixed everything. This is true with their other games like Fallen Earth.
5381	0	a	If I could go back to time I'd save myself from installing this game.
25	1	a	This game obviously still needs some development such as optimization, but honestly that's about it. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys teamplay or just fun. Once in to Silver servers it become more competitive so practice to be able to play there against most players. The game still has a small issue of dealing with hackers but from the start hackers have been less and less seen. The game is NOT pay to win, all the armas market items are simply reskins of guns that you can buy from contacts, and even some of the guns you can buy from contacts seem to be better then a lot of the guns you can buy from Armas market.  All in all a good game. :)
7350	0	a	To many hackers
7461	0	a	I would not recommend this game. If you're not willing to cough up the money, then the game isn't that fun. As either a Criminal or an Enforcer, you get mauled by others before you even get a chance to try to learn how to play. If you're new, then no one wants you. For me, probably because of my location from the server, it lags. This has a big impact. If it lags even a tiny bit, and makes it so you can't aim straight, or drive the car correctly, let's just say, 'It's not fun.' So, unless you don't have any lag at all, you can pick up how to play in the first few minutes, and you're willing to cough up the cash or barely get anywhere, then all the luck to you.
9188	0	a	WORST F2P ON STEAM, LOOKS LIKE A PAY-TO-WIN WITH GRAPHICS THAT MY NETBOOK COULD HANDLE.
8452	0	a	4 years ago I wrote a review regarding this title and as those 4 years have come and gone I hold a different opinion on this game. APB: Reloaded is a cops and robbers shoot em' up featuring loads of customization from tattoos, cars, guns, music, and of course your character. Now on paper it sounds like a solid idea and I will say it is but I have a few gripes. Like and other lesser know F2P title this game relies on micro-transactions (not forced thankfully) that are a little stupid. You want to own a gun perminately well throw some G1C down (in game currency) and your all set. Besides that matchmaking is more barren than a woman in her 70s I will sometimes by luck find a district full of 7 people or a measely 2 which is not exciting at all. All though im torn with the idea I can't recommend this game to really anyone sorry APB.
7380	0	a	if you seriously like this game there is something wrong with you lmao
5451	0	a	I am not intrested in games with just pvp all the time and the players are hackers and jerks so i do not recommend this game at all.
1534	1	a	COOL GAME LIKE GTA 5
4874	0	a	Welp I guess i should explain a little of my history with this game, I was a beta tester for apb reloaded (not the original) the game at the time looked great and had the potential to be better then or equal to GTA. I played this game for a very long time with a friend, until for some reason we both quit the game. I didn't remember why we left, It was vague but I felt sick just thinking about the game. 3 years later I felt like going down memory lane to see if the game is still kicking. I got my friend back into trying it again. And once I press the play button, it all started to comeback to me like a fever dream. With a slap to the face the game reminded me why this game was terrible. After 3 years its still the most unbalanced, exploitive, laggy, and grief filled game I remember. Seeing that the loading screens with the dial-up sound effects are still in the game makes me vomit.   Maybe I should go over what I loved about this game before kicking it in the balls with fury of a thousand suns.   Pros: Customization- This is probably the best level of customization I've ever seen in games, even AAA games fail to bring this level of control to how I want my character to look. Its a pretty simple system and I'm surpised not many games do it. Theres custom cloths, cars, themes, and etc. It really is where I use to waste alot of my time in the game.  Match Making- This is gray area for me because I both hate and like the match making. In apb you choose to have a death match(fight club), or go into the districts to have some random match making as you drive around when your ready. I spent most of my time in districts because that much more familiar to me then fight club. Drive around with a friend then randomly a call goes out to steal some stuff or defend some stuff or keep some stuff ( Mainly a crim by the way). Its exciting to be thrown into a match, but its bad when its far away or when its already being taken.   Now that I'm done taking about what I like about the game, lets go over why I left this game.  Cons:   LAGGY- Even during launch this game wasn't this laggy, I tried looking into why this is. Apparently they've been getting ddos attacked for a while. How many times? I don't know but enough to keep lag constant in this game.  Punkbuster- I've been gone a very long time, but I'm sure that punkbuster security still sucks right.   Cars- Car are still feel like crap on the road, I maybe able to tolerate the cars in this game. That does not mean I like them in anyway.  Guns- Some people tried to convince me that this game isn't p2w, but when I saw my friend go from 2 or 4 kills to 8 or 11 a game with just using a code for a weapon from the market place. I gonna say thats bs, the premium weapons have less recoil, some have more damage, mods, etc. And if you get to rockets ro gernade launchers say goodbye to balance because they are crazy.  Character modifications- Clotting agent is the only one you need, kevlar is worthless and makes you slow.   Districts: After all this time still only 2 districts waterfront and financial, all with no real changes or improvements. nothing about these areas are interesting and I feel like I know these place backward and forward.   This game could of been good, but its still what I remember a piece of crap I played before. ( And yes I know about the engine upgrade, I'll try it again when It drops, then be mad at myself later).       
8165	0	a	I will say this game has the best customization in a game I have ever seen! but as for gameplay goes, driving in this game is horrible it's like every car is on ice being a free game as well has invited a lot of hackers to play and the game is just dead now.  Don't waste your time.
7355	0	a	this game was bad when it came out and it still is. too bad, good idea, just done horribly.
240	1	a	Very good game. I think its excellent needs a decent computer to run tho only problem and it takes skill which i have.
5236	0	a	It's just impossible there are cheaters and it's as buggy as heck.  but the uninstall button worked!
9912	1	a	Well after a bit of time spent to this game you can say it's cool and not.   This game has a lot of pottential, It has a verry well made story line with a lot of world events arround that will allow you to grather, level and have fun as a lone wolf or with your friends.   The Engine the game has it's old as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it's all glitchy and laggy due the G1 not supporting FE development enough but still i think you should give it a try when you have time, It's all about getting out of sector one wich is the worst place of them all, after that the S2 PvP S3/Deadfall/The District and /PvP is quite funny and entertaining. Level 55 PvP is not the best but not the worst either, to much drama honnestly.   The best thing about it as a F2P is that it's truly F2P. You can do a quick 5 min survery and buy the cheapest item from the marketplace with like 5 G1C and unlock the 10 Red Chips money cap wich is the only thing that hold you back a little. I've so far invested about 5 minnutes into the marketplace and 0.00$ into the game since it went F2P.    Crafters might want to buy commander though, It'll speed up the crafting stuff quite a lot and It allows you to have a larger crafting que.
4937	0	a	Nothing more than â¥â¥â¥â¥, Sorry gamefirst, But your stupid pay to win system is too much for me.
3782	0	a	If you have enough money you can win at this game!   Yes you can unlock and buy weapons with ingame money too, but premium weapons are way too powerful. When you have low level starting gear and the matchmaking.............It's total b*llshit! You have to play with people who have bigger level and better weapons than you. The biggest problem is that this game has, is its unbalanced matchmaking and premium gear.  Edit: 14/5/2015  The community of this game is so toxic! The game is full of trolls, A*sholes and premium guys calling free to play players noobs.   Do yourself a favor, and don't install this if you don't want to pay for guns.
10158	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
10403	1	a	Lots of similarities to WOW. Games is F2P, but if you buy a subscription you can craft items faster and you can buy stuff from their site. Apparently you also get points to use every month even if you never pay.  Game has an interesting story line, post-apocalyptic, with a very large map. Community and clans seem very nice and I was invited to join a clan quite early and even when clan players aren't available there are enough people playing that you can temporarily team up with someone to finish a quest.  Crafting list is immense with 9 or 10 categories and loads of items in each category.  Melee &amp; ranged combat pretty balanced.  Definietly having fun so far.
5679	0	a	Long loading screens, many time wasters, worst game ever. I deserve some hash browns.
9837	0	a	The game felt old for 2011, let alone 2015, don't bother.
4188	0	a	this game wont even work for me ive tried everything if someone knows how then please tell me 
3521	1	a	This game is no doubt pay to win(and its really not cheap), however u can have lots of fun even without paid items. Most of the free guns sucks if you compare them to the paid ones, but you can still kill people with them quite easily.  PVP system in game is nicely done, its not boring at all, lots of action and blowing stuff up. Matchmaking is a little bit unbalanced, although it depends on what players are currently on server and what players are ready for a match. Sometimes it gets annoying if your enemies have paid 400k euro for guns without recoil.   Marketplace is one of the best things in this game, u can sell your 'artworks' to other players or buy stuff from other players, you can also buy there paid items for money you earn in game, but its really expensive (its obtainable, but it takes time)    The 'creation' systems is really well made, u can make basically everything in it (your logos, emotes, artworks), then put it at your clothing or on your kickass car. The customization in this game is just GLORIOUS. Characeter creator is really really good, you can make some serious stuff there, if you know what i mean xD  I strongly reccomend you to buy a premium, its worth it, you will be able to make more complicated paterns, clothing etc.
5620	0	a	i wish i could play it
10498	1	a	It's time to go back.
3066	1	a	Amazing F2P grand theft auto type game love the fact you can also play as the police or criminals and even upload your itunes music and play it in your car! :D
6388	0	a	This game haves great potential if it would be in the right hands but this isn't the case and I doubt it will ever be. It was somewhat good back in 2010 and 2011 I at least enjoyed it and so did lots of my friends after that starting back in 2012 it went all downhill. The managment is idiotic, the new devs are once again untalented uncreative idiots, servers suck s-y â¥â¥â¥ and the list goes on. Instead of fixing the f-g game they ignored the issues and implement more issues by every f-g patch. Armas shop guns are pay to win bs and get tweaked by a new weapon release so obvious bs. Lots of players obviously left due to all these issues. I really wish someone good enough will take over this project because as it is now it's a pile of rotten s-t and there's nothing left. I really loved this game but they just destroyed it and took a s-t on it as a cherry on top. GF and RP I hope you f-king die in a longest pain.
121	1	a	A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out. I playing this game for a while now and i'm still loving it! For beginners is it in the beginning of the game very frustrating that you gonna play against very good players. But when u play alot u will become good 2. :) (sorry for my bad english)
7438	0	a	boring game , cheap gta rip off
8492	0	a	APB Was A Fun Game Until Getting Into The Salty Horrifying Community... Just dont get the game.
4617	0	a	Like every 'Free to Play' Game out there, today. You get a bunch of fedora sporting, neckbearded fat â¥â¥â¥â¥s and spoiled kids spending their mommy's money or their benefits checks on overpowered â¥â¥â¥â¥ for their characters. Just as soon as you start playing, you're constantly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in every direction by unbalanced weapons and rockets and all you get is a two inch â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a weapon that does nothing. The cars control like you're on ice, even when those cars look like they're your typical front-wheel drive rice burner from Fast and the Furious or an All Wheel Drive supercar. If you want a game that you can play for free, don't waste your time and save your money on a better game. Seeing games like this is no wonder that they get bombarded by hackers and trainers.
255	1	a	People saying this game is pay 2 win are just extremely poor at the game. Sure some cars are expesnive. But who gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥, you always end up stealing a car on the street for the missions. Skins on the guns are useless. Some of the weapons are very good, but they can all be bought for ingame currency which isnt hard to get any of. Weapons are very balanced. Snipers arent overpowered at all.
3752	0	a	The game itself is in my opnion close to perfection IF! it had the been released right the first time. With no bugs more content.  Pros: The gameplay is amazing. driving cars is fun and different. some cars are hard at first and so satisfying to drive when you get the hang of it. The shooting in the game is also really amazing (tho it was far better before they started infesting it with new weapons) every gun is different. like playing a new game every time you change weapons. social district without a doubt the most unique part of this game.  Cons: The company behind it is absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥. They are only focused on milking their players for money and as much as they can. They barely update the game anymore. hasent been a good update for years. The players in the game are toxic and mostly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. its near inpossible to find a decent human being on it. Hackers, this game as been dealing with cheaters since it came out. Tho less hackers than you would think.   i would not recommend this game at all what so ever right now. the game went from almost finished to alpha stage. has only gone downhill since g1 took over this game.  I have spent 2500+ hours on this game. and this is all my opnion.
5640	0	a	gta multiplayers worst copy :(
2076	1	a	A pritty fun game. u can be a cop or gamgsta. extream car chasings, lots of shootouts. pritty much all u can expect from a theme like that. and probably the best and most detailed caracter costumization i ever saw in a game.  Only think i dislike, or maybe am not used too. no headshots. at the end it comes 2 who has the gun with the most damage or who is tricky enough and gides behind walls or cars fast enough. At the end it is a pritty decent game, And funn too play
7919	0	a	*DON'T BE FOOLED. THE VIDEOS MAKE IT SEEM AMAZING* When I first saw this, I thought it looked incredible. However, the game doesn't even load! It's really disappointing.
6470	0	a	First time setup takes too long to load. if you are immortal or simply have a few years to waste then i do recommend this game. customization in this game is amazing, but gameplay is simply horrible.
3243	1	a	Ok. So you like grand theft auto? Do you like MMO's? Cause if so, this Free-to-play game is a fun one. Its a very skillful game is a lot of fun to play. Now with all F2P games, there is a paying part to it. But listen to me, the paying to win part is not that bad as other games. In this game, for most paying purposes, it would give that SAID player a Advantage to OTHER players. In this game, I like to think of it as the COC iOS game. You can do it all legit, or you can pay for shortcuts. Those guys who kill you and seem so good? Its cause they have 1000 hrs+ alts and have spent ACCOUNT PREMIUM stuff. Now if you start out BRAND new, you will have Abosoutly have no idea what your doing, but it does have a VERY rewarding tutorial. Anyway The real P2W part about this game is the PREMIUM. Yes just Premium. This 'Premium' is alot more powerful than people think. This P2W aspect makes you make your normal cash, normal contact XP (XP) and THEN, the EXACT same amount with a 50% increase added to it. so in all, its like your getting a 150% increase in your stuff. Anyway, enough rambling, this is a VERY good game, giving people free Codes to enter and enjoy some of the P2W stuff. Now this is the kind of game that you either like or dont, but there are so really dumb aspects to it. Anyway, overall Good game. The P2W's and Smurfs (CS:GO Lingo meaning alters) kind of make it hard to join in. But this game is very skillful and, if you get some friends, its ALOT of fun.   ------Stay Awsome-----
8239	0	a	Very laggy, most weapons are obtained through in game purhcases.Needs to be balanced.
4243	0	a	It is a poor man's GTA Online.
8193	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.
5454	0	a	Sorry but this game died once GamersFirst took over. Even though I got over 300 hours, I just might play one more time. BUT this game is P2W so fucc that!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHA REKT.
8372	0	a	Pay to win.
6586	0	a	After some time playing APB, and spending some money on 30-day premium account, I would not recommend the game. The game is full of hackers, the matchmaking is awful. Gold-rated players vs Bronze-rated players. The server lags every 5 minutes. The 'comunity' is full of annoying and toxic people. For new players, the game is non-friendly.  If you plan to buy guns, vehicles or stuff like that, for 30-day or lifetime, prices are way too high. I find the developers so greedy.   However, the game has a lot of customization chances, and the open world, free roaming and missions are good. But they don't justify the game itself.
928	1	a	Its like Saints row, but free
1478	1	a	gave me adware  10/10 pay for a lot of content simulator
7666	0	a	This entire game is based off of the classic 'MMO' grinding. This doesn't translate very well into a GTA 'cops 'nd robbers' setting. This game has so many flaws, 80% of my time playing this was just trying to get it open based on multiple launches. It's not worth the download time and the stress. Don't play this. Jesus christ, between the loading times and the god damned lag when driving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing -CAR-, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE EASILY, MIND YOU, this game is a mess. It needs to be pulled into the backyard and shot OR redone from the ground up, which is something I -KNOW- won't happen. God damned. I'm never going to get this time back from my life.  I give it a ten because I'm a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot.
8773	0	a	I made two new accounts that i have never played on before and my account got suspended because of a terms of service thing. I am over 18 and i accepted the terms of service on both accounts and i saw nothing wrong but as soon as i try to join a district im banned.
3264	1	a	fun, good customization, pleanty of cars, lots of clothing,customization scrolls, etc.
8430	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
9269	1	a	It lives up to the definition of mmofpsrpg. The presentation's a little rough, and the game elements are thrown in your face kind of suddenly at the start, but it all works. Graphics seem a little dated but not terrible. Shooting is good, custmization is good. Plenty of story to discover as well.
624	1	a	THIS GAME IS CHILL BUT A LITTLE DEAD YUEAHHH
4198	0	a	After 3 years of playing it,I can make a review: First of all,this game is in the category 'pay2win',for example a DLC with a few costumes,vehicles and some weapons that are NOT permanent costs 93â¬.Not to mention that you can really enjoy this game after you pay at least 100$.. These are the pros: -Great character and vehicle customization,it even include a symbol designer,which you can use for creating your own symbol -Each mission has his own story,like delevering a briefcase or killing the opposite team Cons: -You have to pay at least 100$ to enjoy -Laggy -Still full of bugs -Hackers -The gold ranked players invading silver ranked servers -It gets boring,it has only 2 mission districs,1 social(in which you can customize your character,vehicle and socialize),and 2 other districts in which is only team deathmatch;excluding events -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t community,if you haven't spent 50$ or more you are considered a 'noob' -If you are new or think of start playing this game,you stand no chance agains the player with OP weapons that cost over 500$. Back in 2011/2012 it was better,even thought were still some problems My rating for this 'game' is 5/10
108	1	a	The game's customs is what makes it fun. The gameplay you have to have patience with your self and the game, cause if you dont you will get tired of it real quick. Other than that the game is MAD fun XDD
5974	0	a	is this even a game
7609	0	a	when i can even get this game to work its awseome but i had to make a new charter when i saved and my pc crashed 5 min after
5420	0	a	My first impression of the game was filled with annoyance and hate. Walked around enjoying the wonderful city, it was great. Seeing tons of people run around was nice. Then when i start or attempth to start a mission, thats when things got from nice to extremely bad. I was going to mission points like normal, thinking what rewards id get finishing it. Then i died cause some idiot sniped me for no reason, i say ok. Then as i attempth to do the mission again. Someone runs me over with an ambulance, thinking it might just be bored players i waitted for a day or two. Then when i try the mission again dead, this pattern repeated itself none stop. So... I uninstalled the game and said 'Yup, i'm done with this.' so i quit the game.   APB gets a final score of 0.5/10   (Should have a lower score, but i enjoyed what little there is the game has to offer but expirience wise. I didn't enjoy it one bit, too many people killing you. No PvE mechanics, seems to cater to the people that just kills new players for no reason, and this is why it gets this score.)  The graphics is fairly decent, nothing over the top eyecandy. Sound is so-so, and gets boring. Gameplay is extremely bad to extremely poor (Too many Annoying people.)  This game is only for those people with no respect for other peoples prefference of playing nice and slow. Casual players avoid this game, go play something else.  Peace. 0 Comments Subscribe to thread (?)

1449	1	a	this game.... ugh.......
736	1	a	Great game but only when u have Better graphics card..
8136	0	a	Totally waste of time... Free to Play games should be banned from Steam....grinding and money draining as we are going to work to be ripped off whilst spending some time with our hobby! If you want do do a favour to yourself leave F2P games to old people on Mobile Phones!
3181	1	a	Nice game to play. 9.5/10
2696	1	a	The gameplay is likeable, with some nice gunplay and driving mechanics. similar to that of GTA. The character and vehicle customization is rather amazing. you will probably get hours of gameplay simply from customizing and using your character, not to mention how addictive the game is. This is an ideal free to play game for people who do not want to spend money, considering how real money is not required at all to play. Almost all items in game can be purchased through ingame cash, with the items that are not buyable with ingame cash are extra things. Overall the game is fantastic.
9186	1	a	well to be honest I didnt expect much from this game but the quality isnt so bad its just needs major improvments to the Ai and I think it could be a great game to play.
3309	1	a	I love this game a lot.A real police game. I would like to have good Grapical. I really exicited to play this game. I canÂ´t wait anymore.I love police games.And in this game you can play youÂ´re real life that is fantastic. Fantastic
9257	0	a	Fallen Earth at first glance seemed like a good game, and it seemed to have a a good story, but it's gameplay is something to be desiered and not worth the time to download.
10536	1	a	One word, One meaning, One to conquer All. VGS VGS! SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZBOT!
10432	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department? There is nothing quite as rewarding as savaging through mounds of garbage, collecting various long rusted do-dads, and long forgotten whats-its to make various deadly weapons to gut, barrage, or otherwise eviscerate various pus drooling mutants.  Okay, so the crafting is still varily limited. But compared to most MMORPGS it is still rather 'up there' on the scale of awesome. Combine that with real time FPS combat (which still boils down to a-typical pulling and grinding, admitably) and you got yourself some fun times.  The game is rather graphic intensive, but after kicking the graphics down even my laptop with it's outdated drivers and such was capable of running it releatively smoothly. Grab a friend, get your horse and hit the waste! It's time to launch your career as a down and dirty, gun toting scavager!
3380	1	a	My rating : 6/10  This game is a bit similar to GTA or Mafia 2 with okay performance.
1587	1	a	This game will make you love Vanilla Cookies. Don't ask questions...
887	1	a	6/10, This Game Is Easy To Pick Up And Play. But to have some Luck, you need to Devote.  So many of you may already know of this game like me, But this games i gave a 6/10 because the gameplay, the customisation, all of that. Strip it away for a second and see how the game is built. ARMAS - Providing Players with the option to buff their Chars/Accounts with weapons and cars. PREMIUM - Allows Players to futher their customisation and earn more money from missions. Those two are the biggies that get me down. Because i love the customisation that those 2 allow me to expand in and yes i do get that they need money somehow but whenever i log on i think about Patches. A patch where we can trade JT or $ For G1C (GamerfirstCredits.) So overall i have a fun time in the game and it's exactly why I've got almost 150 hours into the game.  If Yu Wanna Play with Me I Will Either Be on Enforcer - OfficerBanshee Criminal - Quanzy Don't ask me where I got my names from. LONG STORY _________________  Mr. Retro Signing Off - I Reccomend this if you are willing to put hours upon end into this game ;)
1848	1	a	It's OK
4818	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the amount of Character/Vehicle customization.
10017	0	a	too much of a hastle to get a account and i have tried everything so ya they need to simplify it.
3213	1	a	I get in game do a mission and get rekt by kits that paid for guns that are better using their moms credit card. 10/10 would get rekt again
3964	0	a	This used to be my favourite game but now it's terrible. Every time I decide to come back and have some fun with it like the good old day it reminds me how much I hate this game. It's so broken it can't be fixed. Believe me I know G1 tried but they made it worse. I won't even start the P2W topic and the fact that there are many hackers that just don't get banned because they bought some G1 credits.
1797	1	a	It's free, so why don't try it.
7586	0	a	Fun game, terrible support, filled with trolls and hackers. The cars and robber / cop faction was fun. Go buy GTA and skip this one.
9455	0	a	Couldn't get past the 'create account' and log in with steam crap. Waste of 6GB hard drive space.
927	1	a	This game is like Yoyaz's house.Dark and full of wierd smells.

7378	0	a	2/10 wouldn't recomend to a dead person, eats the liveing â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of your ram if not then their is almost always a memory leakage for non 64bit systems &amp; microtransactions around every corner almost everyone is either a hacker, glitch exploiter or paid a ton of money for anything as useless as a â¥â¥â¥â¥ stain on their shoes, would rarther rip my balls off and play call of duty 4 with a lobby full of prepubescent 9 yearolds.
8181	0	a	Incredibly pay to win, skill has little to do with how much you win. Easily the worst community I've ever seen on any game.
6903	0	a	Honestly, I really like this game. Its free to play and fun to play but it always glitches and lags too much to even pretend to play. If it wasnt for that Id highly recomend it but there seems to be no fix for the lag and whatnot 
4610	0	a	The game is a cheat fest at this point, and the developers do nothing about it. I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you're a revenge hacker.
1703	1	a	This is a great open world, free to play shooter giving multiple missions and vehicles to mess around with (as well as loads of guns.) The graphics are great, gameplay is fluid and exhilirating and the game hooks you in and makes you want to play more.  Only few criticisms I can give is that the missions are fairly repetitive, and that there are sometimes giant lag spikes (this could just be due to my internet of course.)   I recommend this game and I would give it an 8/10.
9917	0	a	They would not give me a motorbike 0/10  but in all seriousness this game is horrible.
1451	1	a	I set my balls on fire. Not in the game, I just thought I'd mention it. 10/10 like skyrim with jews.
3594	1	a	If you love making people angry  This is your game 
7436	0	a	APB Reloaded is not a very good game for a few reasons.  One: driving. Driving in this game is a chore. The streets must be made of solid sheets of ice, because cars slide around on turns. They're very hard to control, especially for beginners.  Two: unfair advantages. This game features microtransactions, which, when done properly, are not a problem at all. APB does it wrong. The more expensive guns are clearly better than others, putting inexperienced players or those who don't want to spend money on this game at a severe disadvantage to those who do. There is also no skill match mechanic, meaning that new players have a chance at going up against top-level players much of the time. This quickly leads to much frustration at not being able to do anything. For the new player, the only way to advance is to get lucky, which is not a good first impression.  Three: the game constantly pushes these purchases on you. If I wanted to buy something from this game, I would visit the marketplace myself. You don't need to constantly remind me that something's on sale. If I cared enough, I would check the sales out myself.  Four: the gameplay itself. Gameplay is unbalanced and frustrating, leading to much confusion for the new player. Objectives are hard to find, and the instructions vague at best. Rest assured most of it involves killing.  There is only one possibly redeeming quality about this game, and that is that there are good customization options for your character. This is dragged down by the fact that to get these customization options, you need money, which is earned by either trudging through the impossible missions or buying currency.  All in all, this game is only playable if you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars on it, and even then, it's mediocre at best. This game left a bad taste in my mouth, and you can be sure I won't be coming back for another bite.
7008	0	a	If you like waiting extreme periods of time just to play a low graphics game, this is the game for you! When you first log in, you get to what I call the 'black box of death'. (And that after all the 10 other loading screens). Then you'll sit through 24 more loading screens and eventally wait 12 hours to get in a server, only to find that everyone is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that only kills you.
1906	1	a	After a long break I've returned for more blood. It's a bad day to be an enforcer. :)
2173	1	a	If you like to rage a lot, this is your type of game.
4699	0	a	I dont recommend it. Pros= +Free gta clone +Nice Customization +Many Players Cons= -You cant change sens to very low -Toxic Community -Laggy -Hackers  
9151	1	a	This game is a very fun game to play despite a few glitches sometimes but I would definately recommend this! &lt;3

10578	1	a	I had never played any of the other games in the Tribes series when I decided to play Tribes: Ascend. I had no idea what to expect. I had heard it was pretty fast paced.  I was wrong.  I had heard it had a steep learning curve.  I was wrong.  The fact of the matter is that Tribes: Ascend might just be  the  most frantic, fast-paced FPS experiences you will ever encounter. The learning curve is not just  steep , it is like a big wall that goes straight up and then (due to the massive amounts of gravitational pressure) bend backwards at the top. At least that's what it felt like to a newbie like me.  They say that the best things in life are free. Tribes: Ascend is pretty darn fun, just get it. 
3156	1	a	I would really LOVE to play this game. The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle. But there some downsides in which i should mention... 1. No sign of australian servers. Im from Sydney, so that means playing on a US server is like playing with alot of viruses in your pc. and i mean ALOT. 2. AIs. Yes, the AIs are â¥â¥â¥â¥, like. Very Very â¥â¥â¥â¥. But really, the fun youll be getting out of this is the players. Which is another problem. 3. Players. There really isn't alot of people on the servers, Exept for like, one US server. The rest of the servers are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing empty nearly, i saw a server with 4 people on. Get this is mind, one server PER country, no, one server IN US AND BRAZIL. 4. P2W. Or Pay to Win. Lets get this straight. I, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, Hate, pay to win games. Sure, it can be fun to play f2p games, but when it comes to that point when you keep getting killed by the same noob who bought a shotgun for 10 dollars. Its just not fair. I have no problem with pay to win games like planetside 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No... 5. Car mechanics. Oh god where do i begin? You know those frustrating Ice physics you see in games? Its sort of like that. but this time, you driving a car on an ice-skating rink painted black and white with a bit of yellow. Its that bad, like REALLY bad. IDk if its just ther server problems i mentioned earlier or just a bug the developers cant be â¥â¥â¥â¥ed fixing.  Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for. i'd say 5/10. If you have spare time, give this game a ride.
7479	0	a	Don't bother wasting any time much less any money with this game. Gameplay is mostly repetitive and frustrating, and the city itself feels lifeless and bland apart from the players.   Can be be fun for a short time if you're with friends, but even then the shoddy gameplay mechanics get in the way of anything but a game of Quack! Quack!
2722	1	a	i love poilici chase so i download this game i LIKE IT SURE PLAY IT
5058	0	a	Might be a good game if it actually friggin did something when you clicked start, super awesome.
4460	0	a	This game is the worst example of a Free to play (pay to win) game, the guns are so out of balance and unrealistic that even snipers don't have a scope view. the only thing that balances out weapons are weapon mods which are only available at a high level which is almost unreachable if you dont have 'premium' because by the time you would reach that  A; you falcon punch through the screen or  B; spend a butt load of cash on the game.   And the matchmaking should be shot and burried you will constantly fight against fully geared player who will Destroy that little, tiny, spec of fun the game has to offer.
1852	1	a	Cool concept. â¥â¥â¥â¥ dick game. One of the worst allowed on steam.
2783	1	a	I am so addicted to this game. If I could afford to, I would skip work to play this all night tonight and all day tomorrow. Simply amazing!
8881	1	a	With a story that was developed with obvious care, to the extent that character-respawning is one of the largest facets of the game, you can tell that this game had it's heart in the right place. This may seem like nonsense to you, but a lot of games out there these days simply tack on the story to the rest of the game, rather than the other way around (as it should).  With a game like Fallen Earth, you can tell that the story came first, and everything else was built around there; from the architecture, weapons, vehicles, and equipment, it all makes sense within the setting. With the way the game's story is, there isn't the problem of 'when everyone in an MMO is the chosen character, no one is', and the characters within the game treat you as a person and not The Big Cool Hero. Extremely refreshing.  If that doesn't say anything, let me tell you something about my hours in this game (on the other version of Fallen Earth, as there are two in Steam, as for a little while FE wasn't on Steam): I have over 2000 hours in the game, a feat surpassed only by my GMOD hours.
10369	1	a	PS2 graphics...  WoW harvesting mechanics and a little more detail than WoW crafting.  The controls were made by a 5 year old... if you have a multi-button mouse a good scroll wheel and you don't mind pressing Tab every 5 seconds it's not that bad.  The combat mechanics are sluggish, ranged weapons are the way to go as anything melee doesn't hit even though your weapon passes right through them.  Most of it is like as if WoW and EVE Online had a baby that was missing a limb or two &gt;.&lt;  It takes at least the first couple missions to get over the learning curve of the game mechanics and controls, other than what I mentioned at the start it gets better quickly... you also get a mount (horse) right at the starter area so it's great for exploration.  I'll be playing more of this game to see how far I can get in it without it being dullified otherwise I would recommend this to anyone who want's an WoW/EVE Online game experience, yes it takes real-time to craft things, it takes 'Skill Books', you are a clone, you have to mine/salvage minerals to craft... it's all pretty much an EVE Online game made 3rd/1st Person shooter.
9788	0	a	steam please stop recommending this game to me it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible
1694	1	a	It's kind of like GTA but with more grinding and hella unbalanced weapons. You'll rage a lot, but it's such a wonky and silly game that you'll enjoy it anyway. But bring a friend, if you do.
8663	0	a	An awesome game , ruined by his publisher. Try it just for fun , if u wanna win , you will have to pay.
9118	1	a	I wonder how many hours its gonna take me to get to level 55
493	1	a	APB was good in the start, my best ever ping was 180, it went up to 500â1300 ping, saw one frame every few minutes, deleted 160 ranked account. Gave my friend 2 mill. Gave him 5 good vehicles. Oh, and a Nano. It is a very good game if your internet is good, although, it can get boring after u have basicly everything, which will take some time, if your internet is bad like mine.. Don't download it. But if u have a good internet and are bored most of the time, and have 1-3 friends to play APB with in your friendlist, it will be very fun. There are quite a few hackers + scammers. Beware.
9487	0	a	Honestly I Probably might like this game if it wasn't for  A)The 3rd Party EULA/Login  and B) the fact i couldn't login even though i had signed up  Hopefully this will be fixed.
6382	0	a	Planetside 2 runs better than this.  That's saying something.
9832	1	a	it is a good MMO I like it it is not the best but not the worst
879	1	a	very nice game 
4323	0	a	The customization on this game is really good i must admit for quite an old game.  Pretty fun at start rekting people. Occasionally you get them hackers... not fun.  However, I really Hate the weapons that have this 30 day buy deal or Permenant deal for a certain price which then gets expired. It REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks and not a great system imo. It also sucks how you buy a perk in the game; For example, the Car Sufer mod, when i bought it with earned money inside the game i was so excited and I thought it was permenant? But nope. It wasn't. It really sucked.. Quit after that happened.  You play deathmatch and people have Rocket Launchers = instant death. Not fun. This game has died out many years ago. Wish they didn't sell it to this new company.. But heyho.. it happens. Buisness is Buisness.  In the end, I played this game since the beta and just recently got back into it. I have 85.8hrs in total and I would recommend this game if you have friends its really fun. But soloing is pretty boring after a while.  Other than that I dont think this game is worth playing anymore. It has had it's chance and it failed.
9368	1	a	One of the best free to play post-apoc mmo I have played. It has everything from crafting to killing and well everything else you love in a wasteland game...even zombies but thats a given.
1851	1	a	i love this game but since my old computer was bad i did not play it that much because it was laggy but it was amazing 
3691	1	a	yes i would pros free roaming ish you can rob you can be a cop or villian and more cons the frist wepon needs to be buffed beause of how little damage it does and snipers need to have scopes on most because most dont that i us i have got a pistol with ine but not a sniper and the way u play limited still yes i would

6756	0	a	Horrible experience. Very bad matchmaking. Graphics reminiscent of 2007. Character interaction with world on par with original CounterStrike game. To reach its extended character and vehicle customization you either have to pay or suffer endless hours of humiliation in missions against much better equipped opponents.
2750	1	a	Endless playing. Very dynamic. You can never get bored playing, theres lots to do
5279	0	a	Dont bother downloading it or playing what use to be a decent game has now turned to â¥â¥â¥â¥ and go figuer its G1 (Gamers first) fault. a year 1/2 ago it was 1 out of 100 were hacking (cheating) now its like 1 out of 5 are cheating and the rest of the 4 that arnt eather become cheaters or quit, i quit again. if you want to waste your time cash just buy a hack like everyone else they seem to not care anymore.
8776	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
6898	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
8448	0	a	Dont Get me wrong the Game is funn but theres some game changing bugs such as if someone is close enough to the wall the can shoot you through it killing you. another thing theres only one server For NA(North America) and theres way to admins that abuse i was kicked about 12 times in the middle of gameplay i enjoyed playing for a bit but the admins really didnt allow me to play its worth downloading if you Are able to play without getting kicked. good luck dont download this game if you dont have the patients
5327	0	a	'BE ALL YOU CAN'T BE' i'mm guessing thats all â appY wanted before you banned his account, don't even bother pressing the download button on this one, i played it and even with my low hours i know that in hte trailers they show you cool â¥â¥â¥â¥ but hey, you can do that|! if you feed them a thousand dollars you could've bought something better with , payday 2 (-_-) , gta v a proper online open world skirmish where guess what , DLC IS FREE and the only payable thing for is money which you could easily earn in about 30 mins. my verdict they empty your pocket then give you an â¥â¥â¥ bronzing , this is just a massive kick up the â¥â¥â¥â¥ for people trying to play a 'free to play' something this falls short of being.
5519	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
10300	1	a	I found this game very easy to start and follow along. Free to play or Cost an â¥â¥â¥ load it has it all.
6085	0	a	I'll sum it up with just one word and that word is â¥â¥â¥â¥, absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6814	0	a	no support from the company when you lose money on a purchase do no use
1990	1	a	Fun Fun..... not a lot for me to do like drive around since my Fps skills suck but its a fun game.
8089	0	a	This game is so confusing and never got to kill any crooks or cops because of some reason and all of the stuff is pay to get
6418	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I have ever seen. It is free to play but not free to enjoy. It's pay to enjoy. The 'joker' rifle that you can pay like $3 a month to rent is one of the most OP guns I have ever seen in a game. It kills you in only a few bullets and a lot of people use it, making any and all f2p guns that you can unlock completely useless. Why don't I quit crying and get it then? Because it still means that I will not be challenged by anyone on the other team unless they also have this weapon. It is just not any fun killing/getting killed by two bullets. Trust me it is just not cool. The other massive flaw is the location of missions. They are put in a way that whichever team gets there first can win by simply camping the area because there are just not any ways in that will not see you getting mowed down no matter what. It is some of the worst mission level design I have ever seen.
7678	0	a	It's a pretty good game, but it's the BIGGEST PAY TO WIN I HAVE EVER PLAYED. For example, it takes a while to unlock the rocket launcher. I've played this game for days and haven't come close to getting the gun that can one-shot cars. People can go straight in with real money, buy a rocket launcher, then run around blowing people up when they are such a low level. It doesn't seem fair that the people playing the game like it should be played are getting crapped on by the people who run in with a wod of cash and buy everything in the game.
1711	1	a	did i even have this game?
4577	0	a	I have played this game for little over a year now, with over 660 hours played and over Â£200 spend on ingame-items.   The game is fun when you first start. It is much like GTA but with factions added in. The gameplay can be very broken at times, and the server performance is very poor for EU servers. US servers are much better due to them having their hardware upgraded, so if you can, play on Joker (NA EAST) as it is the most stable server.   The community that resides around this game is like non-other. They will complain about anything and everything, but with good reason. It is only recently, that the game has made any progress in terms of quality of game-play, as the anti-cheat software was updated. The game went from using the free version of Punk Buster, to using Fair-fight, which saw a mass ban of cheaters for a short while. Due to the nature of this game, most cheaters will just create a new account and carry on the way they were. Major content updates are very rare, most updates are re-skinned guns, or clothing/car packs. Many features that we have been promised, such as a kill counter for events, are still yet to show their faces.  The support that is offered for transactions and other issues is not useful at all. It is dealt with by only 2-3 people, who will give you the same automated answer, even if it is not relevant to the ticket that you have made. The rest of the staff that you will com across throughout the game are all generally very pleasant people and good at what they do. Some of them are not so good, and often do controversial things which caused drama within the community, the latest of which is about many of the top tier NA players being accused of hacking and banned hacking, or trash talking on the in-game VOIP software (Trash talking on VOIP is encouraged by in-game tips on loading screens).  In conclusion, if you want a semi-broken game to play with friends and dont have money to buy GTA, play this, but DO NOT spend any money on the game, otherwise you will end up like me (Â£200 out of pocket). 
775	1	a	This game is amazing, 10/10
8755	0	a	my older brother used to play this game ah back in the good times but eventually i got convinced to trying it immediatly i noticed it has the same frames and 10 minute loading screens from gta only the graphics are from 2006...... i wondered to myself why dont i just play gta but then i noticed the games paytowin right on the announcments theres some small sale on the paytowin â¥â¥â¥â¥ pretty dumb some reason i have friends that actually enjoy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ i dont id rather just play gta now why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are you reading this review be productive and have positive vibes man
1687	1	a	this game is aids
9126	0	a	This is a terrible and boring game. Full of Hackers and annoying bugs.   Ignore this game and go play Fallout or something.
792	1	a	Pros+++ +Character creation. +Customization. clothes,vechile,songs,etc. +Decent graphics. +Vehicles. +Lot of challenge. (Its not enough u know how to aim, u cant just run centre of street!) +Can find kind player too, true nerds, u can even buy zelda songs!  Cons--- -Matchmaking!! (U have to join bronze district if u silver or lower threat!) -Toxic/cheating community like most of competive games. -Devs dont to right thinks to improve game. -Some of guns are bit p2w. -Sometimes game lag when it get ddosed. -Car spawnz are op! -Fog of war. -No headshots. -Mission reward low without premium.  Still better game than cs go.
10499	1	a	My favorite part is where no one plays this.   EDIT 2: Apparently people can mark reviews as funny now. Shazbot!  EDIT 3 : ( Rephrased some words below, because for some reason people actually read it. )   EDIT 1 ( MAIN PART OF THE REVIEW BELOW ):   Since people actually somehow managed to find this review, I decided to put at least a little bit of an actual review in here. Not a detailed one because I haven't played the game for a long time, but my personal information about the game.  (SIDENOTE: If you want a review that follows a linear flow of explaining information, this isn't the one. I mainly jump around from topic to topic, mostly because this came from the top of my head.)    ( Sorry random OCD guy.)   Tribes:Ascend is a great game, but sadly, a lot of players are missing from the game because developers have moved onto SMITE and they abandoned this game a while ago.  They have made some changes to the game though, that has varied since the release of Tribes:Ascend. One thing they did was cut back on the amount of grinding required, which was really nice for F2P players. The game certainly isn't pay-to-win, but it is deterring to see that a playstyle you want isn't available for you. Most of the default stuff are mostly usable, but I do have to point out that the other weapons are just more fun to use. ( And sometimes more effective. )  The gameplay features high-speed combat, which will be very rewarding to those who value skill. Coordinated roles and classes give the game a nice feel for it's objective based gameplay, and offers multiple different playstyles. Supportive roles, defensive roles, and offensive roles are ALL viable, and they all help you win the game. There's also a in-game voice communication system that slightly helps with immersion ( if you're into that sort of thing. )  There's also a few game modes ( many of which are probably dead. ).  My personal favorite is Capture the Flag, because it requires a variety of roles by the team. Maybe you want to be the guy who grabs the flag at high speed. Maybe you want to be the guy who sits on the flag and laughs at the guy who just died because he rammed into you at high speed. Or maybe, you want to be like a sneaky ninja and blow stuff up. ( People included. )  The amount of skill required in this game is more than any normal FPS. You can't just aim down the sights of your gun and kill a guy in 1 second. You need to actually try to kill him, because 95% of the weapon in this game are not hitscan, which means you WILL have to shoot ahead of a moving target and if you want your projectile to even land CLOSE to him.  Experienced players will 'blue plate' someone. ( Blue plate is when you hit a poor guy directly with a spinfusor. )  Newer players may find it easier to use rapid-firing weapons until they're ready to try out the Spinfusor.  New players will also learn the term 'Shazbot!' ( Which will not be explained here. )  There is progression in this game, but they unlock different playstyles and weapons, rather than directly upgrading your weapons. ( Not counting some of the other things you can upgrade, but let's forget about those for now. )  You don't unlock a grip for your gun to reduce 15% penalty to accuracy, you don't get a scope and whatever, you'll actually want to unlock other classes and weapons. One of the classes has access to a fractal grenade ( the disco grenade ) and another class has invisibility. I'm not going to list every single class, but you get the point.   Weapons play a large part of Tribes as well as the classes. While a technician can put down a turret, some guy on a hill can make it rain explosives on him and clear the objective for a friendly to move in.  Sadly, you won't be able to unlock TotalBiscuit's voice unless you pay real money.   Yes. His voice is in the game.   You can also buy skins and stuff so you look different. Not like you'd show it off to anyone anyways.   You can also get credits or whatever to buy resupply points and call in orbital strikes. Credits are only for the duration of the match, so feel free to call in the thunder.  As for performance, I've always had a problem on low-end PCs, so this isn't really the game you want to be playing on a low budget, but you shouldn't really have any performance problems if you have a medium to high end rig. There's a few performance.ini's on the internet somewhere if you really wanna play this on a potato. Trust me, I tried, and I at least went fast enough to kill something.   If you've read the original portion of the review, I joke about how no one plays this ( because no one does ) but that doesn't mean I don't want anyone to play it.    If you have slogged through this thing that steam calls a review, give Tribes a try. If you like it, tell your friends. Maybe it'll actually have some people playing it. ( Yeah right. )
7670	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.

4666	0	a	very bad at times pay to win new people are against experienced people and some missions they know where you are with a tracking sign so you can not sneak up on them
161	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!
8120	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 0.50/10
5494	0	a	A complete waste of time. This game is literally the worst MMO to date... This is why Realtime Worlds went out of business and the free version is no different. Don't even download it, because it is full of people who buy guns (with REAL money) and being a new player really takes the fun out of it because people will just snipe you from across the map and have one-hit kill weapons. Stay away from this piece of crap game.
164	1	a	I am torn beetween love and hate for this game. (please note I am writing this at the time the trouble maker is op) this game has some great times and laughs but prepare your wallet and also this games engine is a pile of pissy â¥â¥â¥â¥
3474	1	a	I cant install net framework someone help me please ...
2726	1	a	it wont let me play the game this is bull â¥â¥â¥â¥
6509	0	a	it sucks
6972	0	a	Rather play GTA online. At least GTA online not PAY to WIN.
6774	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
185	1	a	Great game, terrible servers and bad hackers
9169	1	a	yes this game is fun but it would be better with a group of friends then you can work together and just have a better playing experience
4685	0	a	its a pay to win
8878	0	a	I quit playing this game when I found out that the 'Devs' were also the same people who were Hackers, who Hacked the game and used their cheats to ruin the game for other people.  There is no customer Support system.  You can send a 'Report' to the company, but, the same people who are the game 'Devs' will recieve it, reject your complaint, and then ask you to shell out more money for a Premium account.  This game was a complete waste of time, and some money.  The only good thing I found in this game was a Clan/Guild, that soon left the game due to Hackers, and the Devs that don't do anything about the Hackers, because they themselves are Hackers, and enjoy tormenting people in PvP with Invulnerable Characters, an are extremely abusive toward the Players. 
4766	0	a	It wont let me go past the updating even when its finished it &gt;:O

5223	0	a	I have spent countless hours on this game wasting a little over a thousand dollars on it (I'm crying) and everything was great until Fairfight was introduced now this isn't the same Fairfight from battlefield, this is the $5 version of Fairfight, basically what it does is it bans you from hack reports and your K/D ratio so if you do good your going to get reported for 'hacking' and you will get banned.. that's what happpened to me now for the sake of your life don't play this game!
9349	1	a	Good game in my Oponion, And if your looking for a decent MMO then I would get this one.
5741	0	a	It may seem like I played a lot I really kept the launching program on  Should you play APB Reloaded... Just get GTA 4 kids
10016	1	a	Basically fallout for poor people
6212	0	a	Dont Waste your time GTAV is better
57	1	a	This game is broken. It's drains your money and your soul. You can expect every person you meet to be a hacker. And no matter how good your rig is, you can expect to barely be able to run it.  But it's 'free to play' and I drove around in a van with hentai painted on the side of it for an hour then got it blown up. So I guess it's pretty cool. 
2392	1	a	wow much shooter
1031	1	a	Great game overall, excellent graphics and animations. The customization alone has no equal in the MMO gaming world as far as I'm aware. Combine that with a broad selection of weapons, upgrades, skills and other features and you got yourself a top notch game. Its even free to play, what more could you ask for? Well for one its pay to win and if you're not paying they're constantly showing you how much you're missing out on for not giving them money. Do or don't its up to you as it doesn't really add much to the game.  TL;DR  Pros -Good Graphics -Good Character design -Good combat -â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good everything   Cons -They really really want your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money -Like really want it -Want it so bad that the guy who gave them 20 dollars has a gun that kills you in two shots bad -like srs   If you can get past that â¥â¥â¥â¥ then the game is really fun, overall I recommend it.
9338	0	a	Every time I tried to leave the tutorial level, the game would crash.
1090	1	a	The biggest most funnest online open world multiplayer out there!
4573	0	a	Good game if you love dead P2W. Servers are crap and lose control of your vehicles every 5 minutes. Community might aswell all be pewdiepie fans. GG.
10388	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS...I CANNOT LOG IN!!  THEN IM SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS
1803	1	a	Highly detailed character creator. Go to advanced and play around - possibilities are almost endless.  GTA-like gameplay, improved by competitiveness (your mission is opposed by members of the other faction). The pay for better items (which are ridiculously expensive with in-game currency) will leave you at teh mercy of others as a froob though (free playing noob).
1029	1	a	it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

5414	0	a	This is stupid and doesn't work. After downloading the game I clicked 'Play' and it takes me to this pop-up window. I just suspected the game was downloading in that window because there was a loading thing, and when it finished I clicked continue. THEN it takes me to another pop-up saying 'Like us on facebook for free new items!' I finally went to the official site (Which I shouldn't have to, seen as how I downloaded this from Steam) and even their site was useless. DO NOT download this because there is no game to play on this.
10797	1	a	Really fun game, fun mechanics, fun weapons. Only one problem with the jetpacks; everyone has to rely on it, because most weapons are explosive, so no one tries to even airshot, and the jetpack is relied on too much and I find that really annoying. Everything else is fine though. 9/10.
3173	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME. NO KIDDING. see the hours... multiply that by 5 and u have my total overall
3762	0	a	APB is a classic case of great concept done very poorly. After watching it 'evolve' over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading. - Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players) - Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves. - Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws. - They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill. - The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols. - Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game. - Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons. - Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort. - Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making 'improvements' slow to never fix issues and glitches.  Overall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features. It earns a 4 out of 10  **update 11/20/2015** READ THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!! (all examples provided are paraphrased) Pando part talks about how they are not liable for anything that happens even if it is their fault. Punkbuster part clearly states they have full rights inspect the contents of your Hard Drive, RAM, etc while it is running and even take screenshots which they can use publically. Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it. That is but a small taste of what is in that agreement..   I WILL NEVER INSTALL APB AGAIN! I also advise for the safety of your PC and data that you also never install this game!
6449	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ so boring and full of pay to win people
8649	0	a	  Opinion/other stuff
8279	0	a	Can--Can I make a review without being shot in the face by my team mates? Yes? O-Okay.. *Clears my throat* This is my first review so live with me here..  OKAY! I'm going to go through MY experience with this game. It was......Meh. This game is about Criminals wanting to take control of the city, and basically the cops issues Marshal law, so they kill the criminals. You get the Idea, anyways, when I first started, I LOVED, the character maker. SO much you can do to your Character, like adding Tattoos, scars, changing hair, eye, and even nail colour. I made a pretty Bad â¥â¥â¥ enforcer guy, and he's pretty sweet, but I'm rambling. So, you spawn in, right? No Idea what the hell to do, so you just ask around on the chat box, and IMMEDIETLY get cussed out by some white trash wannabe trying to be cool. So, I shrugged it off and learned what to do, making my way up. Now, get this, you can buy stuff with ingame money and real money. Like..Gear that you can KEEP. Guns, no, They expire in 10 days and you have to RE-buy them for like, 1000 in game money. (Price range may Vary) But, back to the community in this game. If you're looking for back stabbing team mates who shoot you in the face, White trash gangsta kids talking â¥â¥â¥â¥ to you, and all around a community that makes the Call of Duty one look like they're nice people? THEN THIS GAME IS THE GAME FOR YOU, SIR-AND OR- MADAM! Thing is, this game gets oddly addictive when you want to keep your character looking badass, But the money is so difficult to get because most of the time, New people at the game have no chance to do good in this game at the start. You're instantly put with people who have better guns and gear, to kill your sweet butt with. And in the end you end up Raging your heart out cause your team mate shoots you with a double barrel in the back cause you tried to play the damn objective! The only Reason why I keep the game, IS FOR THE CHARACTER COUSTIMIZATION! Only reason. Right there. Other than that this game is a Putrid mess of hackers, trash talkers, 12 year olds who scream into the damn mic every five seconds, and back stabbing team mates! I rate this game.....   3/10!  Ony reason to keep: To make and improve your Character.  That is all! I hope you found my review some what helpful! Peace!
8727	0	a	Updates are ruining it, bad tutorial, multipayer is almost dead.
9657	1	a	is very cool game!!!!!!! BRO!!!!!!!!! 
9298	1	a	I actually purchased this game a long time ago, and played it then, got distracted by some other really good games. But this one is online, and has the perks you get with an online game. Thru Steam it is Free To Play, and I can't seem to get the game to start. Did a file validation, there were 11 files missing. I already have an account with Fallen Earth, so I should be good to go, as soon as I get those 11 missing files. What could have happened? Looking forward to getting started again and I'll update my findings. Yay Steam.
8493	0	a	this game is just a game, not intersting game, just a game.. not a good game. just a game.. just a game..  there are better games, this game is just a game
4116	0	a	the game fails to load at all no ater what i do and it goes he same with a mate of mine too
2790	1	a	very underestimated, its really good i like the creativity involed in the game and you should definatly download this. people say this game has hackers and bad performance, i have encountered no hackers and have smooth fps, but what do you expect its a huge game its not going to run 60fps with no problem.  11/10 - ITS FREE!
7860	0	a	worst game ive ever played i cant even play it because every time u have to sighnin
7573	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
9327	1	a	Its k

3363	1	a	i want to play this but it wont function even though i meat the minimal requirements
8471	0	a	I loved this game at one time but I got banned for no reason that they were willing to explain to me and as such had to start from scratch on a new account, what the hell guys?
867	1	a	Review Date: 31.03.2016 My pc specs.  Screen: BenQ 27' 3D LED XL2720Z (1920x1080, 144Hz, 1ms, 12m:1, VGA/DVI/2xHDMI/DP) AMD FX (tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (8 CPUs), -4.0GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 (4gb Memory) 24576MB Memory  MINI REVIEW â APB Reloaded  The Good âºTons of character/weapon/car/clothes/midi customising/modding âºVery fast group system, just to push K âºeasy to unlock weapons, just pledge to one dealer and you on to it.. âºthe stuff you unlock ingame like weapons/cars/mods aint to expensive so you can buy and try them out for a period of time, and you learn Skills with weapons after using then wich also leads to unlock of newer weapons. âºIt have a nice tutorial pushing you through most of what the game has to offer :) âºoffers ton of fun with friends, once you get the hang of the guns and dont get insane â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by ppl saying 'hack this and hack that'  The Bad â¹It can have a stuttering lag now and then, its like the game runs smooth just in missions or pvp that one time lag can lead to a quick death, but its not to often visible thank god. â¹You can pay for elite weapons with alot of nice mods installed on them for real cash, same goes for cool cars, way better than f2p part if you aint using alot ALOT of time to unlock everything. â¹A pvp grindfest and it can get old fast if you aint loving that :), cause the main mission is often attack or defend typish..  â¹No first person view for sniper mode, hehe not bad just really want to se that in the game. â¹Very expensive shop, and it can get alittle confusing how to manouver as a new player!  Worth Noting The game itself is easy to master and to understand, you will be put straight into a brutal battle, either you decide to rob shops as a criminal or mission with other players ;).  May-Aug 2015 Roadmap (they are somewhat alittle after on some parts still): â¢Completion of all EU District Server Upgrades (NOW LIVE!) â¢Joker Mystery Box 17: Urban Legends (NOW LIVE!) â¢EU PC Server Merge â¢US PC Server Merge â¢Espacio Season Pass â¢Refer-A-Friend â¢CRISP: Community Moderation System â¢New Matchmaking Release â¢PC Engine Upgrade Release â¢PS4 Launch and Xbox One Launch   The Verdict: This game has alot to offer for both f2p players and the VIP cash boys, if you look for a casual/semi active  game this might just be it, that said you are loving the GTA style gameplay.. Chat can somewhat be alittle harse with players mostly crying/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing over hackers etc. im sure there are some out there i have not seen any yet!  this game has improved alot since the old 2011 APB, but sadly if your looking for alot of changes they have not given any difference game missions just 2 pvp modes mostly..   I have had alot of fun playing it with friends, and it pushes my heartrate up when trying to reach checkpoint after checkpoint.  'I really recommend players to try it out, i know there will be alot maybe against me giving it a THUMBS UP'  (i am sorry if there are some spelling mistakes  Cheers Mspaint out
6109	0	a	worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game on the internet opened a door i died 10/10 would not play it again
2698	1	a	APB Reloaded isn't necissarily something you would want to play extensively. Much of the maps are drab and boring, customization is enough of a hassle to where you have to farm and play to start looking like you want, and alot of the mechanics that this game tries to work with fall short and make the experience lackluster in the long run. While it's not something I would call a favorite, I have moments in the game I remember fondly, so it's good enough to try at least for a bit. I would reccomend that you pay for at least a month to get a taste of the full game and see if you're happy with the result. I'd give APB: Reloaded and unofficial 7.2/10.
2446	1	a	This is game is a pretty good game but they could make changes to make it better.   -The responding time when you're driving is not fast enough -Hackers are starting to dominate the game -Broken spawn points -Skin texture issues when you load up -Can be boring sometimes, repetive missions  -Finding a mission takes a while because barely anyone plays this anymore -They should add bikes  -The Asylum thing has not been open for a while, that game mode made the game really intense and exciting -Laggy as hell  I stopped playing this game because it became really dull and worthless but if you like free roam,action games then try this game out.
2857	1	a	Very good mmo game.Sometimes the servers are not so good but it is nice.
5769	0	a	Driving is sh*t, matching ising balanced, you have new players matched with players with full mods that its just a one sided fight
7965	0	a	the tutorial isn't really describing how everything works.
1176	1	a	Love it so fun but aim is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3045	1	a	This is by far the greatest rage inducing game I have ever played. You can customize your character to look like just about anything, or make your character into your own unique personality. You can do this same with your vehicles. I have 750+ hours in this game, not just through steam. Most of it was spent customizing, just because you can get very detailed with it. If you have not tried this game, I highly recommend it, but be warned it is not easy and you will rage a lot.
124	1	a	Dis game is alright, its not the best and have many problems but i still play it, cause i got potato sweg yup mhm =)
9308	0	a	welcome 2 update simulator. so first lets update. 2 hours later (in-game time doesn't work propperly) let's start. i was very excited and then it happend. error..... so let's try again. error again. so don't waste your time.

7835	0	a	Id say it was fun to play and uninstall but the game wont even load properly dispite multiple attempts on several different methods of download. If your looking for a game that doesnt load properly then this is the game for you!
1190	1	a	One of the best games ever!. I keep coming back to this game, it's so much fun!
7733	0	a	I would recommend this game to a lot of people, but I will not! Just because there are too many cheaters since the F2P release...!
9437	1	a	Cool but i do belive that nonmebers should get some form of a dune buggy at very low level just because its fair :3
1390	1	a	Cops chasing Robbers  or   Robbers Killing Cops  Nuff Said
8264	0	a	Can't even start the game,please fix this problem.
2586	1	a	cool 
1332	1	a	Im Very Sad I Need A New Computer To Run This Game :( Vista Failed Me Today It Says 'Your Video Card Does Not Meet The Minimum Requirements For Running The Game.' Please Fix This Damn Bug!

6366	0	a	It has virsuses 
4316	0	a	i played this game for well over 300 hours, it full of hackers, unless you wanna spend real money on this game. i would say dont brother, this game is truly cancer
9976	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space.  10/10
5314	0	a	launcher was on this whole time and it counted as hours even tho i barely touched the game    game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ btw
7107	0	a	the graphics are just horrible, the gamelay itself is wacky and killing someone in a match is not just difficult but their health gets restored. I know that its a game but if someone shoots you, youre not magically gonna get restored health. the only good thngs in this game is the driving, the character customization and thats it. the game is just a bad gta copy its horrible in my opinion and its a pay to win game. dont waste time on it.
2645	1	a	Nice game,good idea - 'Cops vs. Thugs' ,I like that you can create character how you want.
10033	1	a	Saw this downloadable on Steam, was thinking about giving it a second chance...Played for several years, took a break. This game, like many others, comes close, but falls short of the Ultimate MMORPG(FPS).  Pros:  Detailed crafting system. Excellent Foraging/Salvaging System. Gain levels from crafting. Crafting actually takes longer (for a realistic effect), ie. you can't craft a car in 2 minutes, it takes awhile... Gameplay is fun, it's nice to have a MMOFPS that actually counts headshots. Graphics are decent. You actually have to aim (for most skills/attacks). Pretty Realistic in some aspects.   Cons: The character animations are super clunky and akward. Small playerbase. The mutations (think of it as magic in other games) are pretty limited, ie. no 'caster' class in the game.   That's about all I can think of for now. Overall, it's a good game, if you haven't tried it, its atleast worth a try!
8172	0	a	wtf is this?
7383	0	a	wot a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit game pay for this pay for that full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ noobs who been playing for years so new people cart do â¥â¥â¥â¥
7597	0	a	Once I got over the horrible sign in with Steam feature I watched some pretty dramatic videos that gave me a rough introduction to the dangerous world of San Paro. After choosing my faction (Criminal or Enforcer) I was pushed into a character customization screen. The character customization in this game is absolutely horrible. I would click on different traitrs and such to edit my character but it wouldn't change anything. Once I had exited and re entered enough times to find a decent pre set skin I jumped over to the next screen. Here I was supposed to name my character and chose a server to play on. I did so naming him of course Mackie D. and choosing the closest server however the game would not allow me to click next and begin the game. I waited thinking maybe my PC was running behind but nothing happened. The menu eventually faded into some sort of an idle screen and when I swivvled the mouse the server select returned. Still I could not get passed that menu and into the game. Since I can't even play the game I'm gonna have to say that I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone. Unless they have an idea on how to fix my problemo.
9049	0	a	Got bored quickly, crashed a lot, the game felt dull, broken and not worth the time spent looking at it...  Now, 4 years later, it's still where I left it... So I will leave it to die in peace.
7490	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
6563	0	a	Hate games that have optimisation, interesting quests, no camping spots, civilian AI and don't let you win if you give them money? Then APB is the game for you. Bet you want to play a bad guy too because being evil is soooo hardcore. Well you are in luck as the criminals always defend so you get to stay nice and snug while camping the point with your insta kill assault rifle that you splashed money on while those silly ol' goodies run at you with pea shooters. You sure are great at video games!  I should point out that the character customisation is brilliant as it lets you change just about every little feature but this is counterbalanced by every player you walk by having the green cap and jeans model as they never load in time.
7501	0	a	I really like the customization... but sadly the gameplay is ruined by a pay to win business model.
4225	0	a	its pretty bad
6447	0	a	Boreing game better off playing with barney and friends poor pc peasants still have no games 2 play , no wonder its a free lol.
1811	1	a	game is great alternertive to other action games like gta 5 but the problem i hate the most is the lag n to op weapons
2511	1	a	Really good F2P game that takes a unique turn on Third Person Shooters and MMOs. The customization is truly amazing. Customize your body appearance, clothing, car, music theme that people hear when you kill them, make your own songs, etc. Main complaints are that theres not enough content to drive the game and the matching system is flawed. You can either do PVP in arenas where a team of Enforcers goes against a team of Criminals, or do missions in one of two mission district instances, which leads to grinding, as the tasks are repetetive. Upon doing these missions, you run the chance of getting matched up against people who greatly outclass you, better perks, weapons, etc. Think of it like four level 20s trying to take on one, two or three level 60s in WoW, along with three, two, or one level 20. GREAT social and competetive game once you level up in that you can customize everything, show it off, and PVP, but leveling up proves to be more frustrating at times rather than fun.
4909	0	a	The worst company =&gt; Unnecessary gamersfirst =&gt; Inane apb rel... They do not deserve you
461	1	a	This game is a difficult game to review. It's a very fun game to play, but it really does feel like a Pay 2 win type of affair. I have not spent money on the game so I should probably be on the other side of the fun fence, but not really. I hear constant stories about hackers but they are a rare case in my experience (Do not hold my experience as a standard, just a point of view). The criminals and enforcers differ in cosmetics only (except that enforcers have stun equipment which does feel incredibly cheap at times). Would I recommend this game? Barely. If anything I listed above sounds like a deterent for you then heed this game. But for me, it's free 2 play so there really isnt anything to lose.

808	1	a	criminals are how you normally play the game enforcers are grade a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scum they wait like cadavering(?) annoying pests and wait for you to get up a high amount of loot from farming the npcs by mugging them or doing ram raids then they waltz in like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s they are, wait for the computer to give them a mission to stop you and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shoot you in the face and steal all your hard work and money in about 5 seconds flat. 0/10 hate this game

847	1	a	Overall its a pretty epic and unique Pvp open world game. Dont listen to all people that try to make it look bad just because they dont know how to be good at the game.  Its not pay2win! U can beat armas weapons very good with non cash weapons. The best weapons like Ntec, PMG, OCA and HVR are all FREE FOR IN GAME MONEY at contacts.  It just takes much time to learn the game (map knowledge, tactics, weapon control and more).   And its also NOT full of cheaters. Of course there are cheaters but its not even half that worse like in many other f2p games. This Game uses Fairfight Anti Cheat. Fairfight monitores how someone is playing (Check  FFBANS.ORG  to see most banned players from APB).  The customization possibilities of APB are just unique. U can almost make every design you want on your cars and clothing :) (Thats why it needs this high amount of RAM) Well about performance its not very optimized because its a old unreal engine version very heavy modified.  Engine upgrade for PC should come after they released the Ps4 version on which they currently working on. But it can run well at 40-60fps when u own a good 4 core Cpu, 8 GB of Ram (its waaay more CPU and RAM intense than GPU intense) and a Gpu with 1 - 1,5Gb of Vram. Of course it depends on your Graphic settings. You can make more detailed graphics Settings with Advanced APB Launcher (search APB forums to find the download for it)..   So give it a try and start learning and u will see its just great.
5102	0	a	Might be fun sometimes but seriously, this game is just p2w (by the joker box weps) You will laugh at me of my time but im not on my main acc now, lol!
4751	0	a	Before I re-installed the game through Steam I had been playing APB for more than 2 years. What caught my attention to the game, apart from the fast paced shooter mechanics, was the mind-blowing amount of customization, encompassing character, clothes, tattoos, cars, death themes, etc. This is, I think, the unique selling point of the game, as I haven't seen something so broad in terms of customization in any other F2P game. Some of the holiday events made by the devs were genuinely brilliant and my liking of the game eventually got me to spend some money to support the devs so they could fix the server issues, lagging, etc. Sure, since Day 1 one of my biggest issues with the game has been the considerable amount of toxicity, but then again the developers are not to blame. Oh, and the occasional hackers too... oh dear. But whatever, I loved APB.  Then the Fire Natio- sorry, the Server Merge happened (supposed to fix the lag).  For crying out loud, what happened?! More lagging!?  It's disappointing to see that most of the server issues, weapon balancing, severe lag, (add any other claim made by the players) haven't been resolved and instead G1 has focused on releasing re-skins of weapons in their insanely expensive Cash Shops. Now I am partially kicking myself for having spent money on the game, but I really hope that the devs can turn this game around and actually listen to the players for a change. Until then I'll keep playing APB (I spent a good amount of money in the game, so I might as well continue even if it pains me).
9005	1	a	After playing this game for 1000+ hours I can finally make a statement.  Pros: - made lots of friends, - had fun for a few weeks,  Cons: - outdated graphics, - juvenile and trolling player base, - balanced PvP? BAH! Forget PvP if you use rifles or pistols. - late game is definietly a money sink. If you don't pay, forget about the Alpha zone or later areas.  Still recommend it as a friend finding application :).  Edit: You can craft grilled prairie chicken. 11/10
744	1	a	Awesome Free Oper World Game!
9909	1	a	I recomend this game if ur interest in a mmo tps or fps zombie game thats open world.
3493	1	a	I love this game, years of playing it. 1300+ hours between Steam and In-Game. It's a little buggy and full of raging teenagers, but the shooting and fighting is great. I've spent hours just driving around and ramming things. If you want a F2P Third Person Shooter with a little bit of a learning curve, I'd recommend this one.
5678	0	a	10/10 would bang, fun to not play... this games sh*t
3578	1	a	  The game has a lot of potencial, it's good idea, but poorly executed. It can be fun for a bit until you start realising all the flaws it has and it's huge pay2win aspect. The gameplay feels a bit clunky and lacking. The graphics are outdated (although they're getting an overall soon). It has a good amount of character customization, although I would love to see some more settings for it, and different styles of clothing. The vehicle handling model is bad, 'nuff said. The UI isn't always that intuitive and user-friendly, could use a cleanup. The game as a lot of bugs, sometimes to the point of being unable to play. The servers fail to deliver too many times to be justifiable, in terms of ping. A lot of the systems are poorly thought out, i.e. the threat system. The pay to win aspect is really the biggest deal-breaker.  'Basically, this game is cancer. I recommend this game, if you want to get ebola.'  On a more serious note, I do recommend this game, just download it, try out a few of the missions, the fightclub, try out the character customization (which is the best if you like social games), the vehicles, all that jazz.  Have some fun with it! It won't be the most amazing game experience, but it's pretty cool if you have nothing to do, and it can be pretty fun sometimes!
5667	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
2315	1	a	1 little baby â¥â¥â¥â¥ tap of your car, can kill someone   10/10
2935	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. Once you start making some customizations, and realize that you won't win every fight, you begin to grow and have a lot of fun. There are tons of options to chose from without ever paying, but the paid XP boost is very helpful.
2785	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
947	1	a	Community is Terrible. Gameplay servers use dial up. 0/10
9663	0	a	An okay mmo with a dead community.
8226	0	a	Played the Original, played the Reboot, played the Reboot of the Reboot, and I can honestly Recommend not to Recommend this game to anyone, not GTA, not Saint Row, not even close, has a lot of frame rate problems, campers, and spawn killers. I think Eve Online has less gankers and that is saying something.
5707	0	a	game is terribad 11/10 do nat get is vry tedios and sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ wen u haz bed compoopder
1734	1	a	really fun when working with people.
1433	1	a	One of My Favourite Games Ever. Great Graphics. A Nice Community. Awesome Maps. Never Gets Boring. And On Top Of All We Can Do lmost Everything.
4678	0	a	****WARNING***** NEVER GIVE THIS COMPANY ANY MONEY!   This company sucks. The game never works. Never has and never will. They only want your money.
9686	0	a	Worst game i've honestly ever played in my life
533	1	a	such a good game can customize a lot of stuff, the graphics are pretty good, i like the gameplay of it,
4963	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.
176	1	a	its great its like gta but more epic FOR FREEEEEE
3896	0	a	3 words: Pay, To, Win
5952	0	a	Just a CoD Knock off. CoD is x10 better and has way better graphics.
1375	1	a	Okey so reviewed this game way back in its CBT and just when it went live on steam, now its had time to grow and all tho alot has changed and stuff has been added its still no where near the lvl i would like them to be , however thats not to say the game is bad i was hooked to this game clocking in well over 200 hours before i even made the jump to the steam version   the only downside to the entire game is that the rendering system as well as the draw distance and the massive buggy engine made the game dip alot , at first it was overrun by hackers Then that was dealt with in the coming months , now its just performance dips and bad memory leaks , now since the time i did play this ive upraded my PC and it runs alot better at least better than it used to i think , either that or its not optimzed alot for 600 series cards and above from nvidia , but nether the less the game will be fantastic when the new engine update hits  AT LEAST we all hope so , for all we know it could get messed up just like everything else does most of the time they release new stuff.  as for the P2W aspect everyone keeps saying... hmmm yeah i can see that even tho i have spent money on the game around Â£200 worth but its defo P2W no perm weapon avaiable in game that you can actually earn or buy from contacts , and dont get me started on the weapons on the market , i sold my nano the day i got it when the joker box hit , sold it for $7.4Mill and its just as worse as today , obciously any new free player aint ever going to be able to afford that let alone afford a 1-2 Slot weapon etc fora 10 day lease , it was hard to make that money at start and it still is
3619	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again
7434	0	a	no its crap and wont let me play it after about 2 hours of â¥â¥â¥â¥ farting around go spend 20 bucks and get gta 1 you will have more fun
3767	0	a	'Oh yeah, the engine version update will happen soon.' ~2014 'Yeah, don't worry, soon.' ~2016  tl;dr -p2w -low population -tryhards and hackers -toxic community -lots of lag  Current state is pretty bad. Very addictive, but at the same time very bad. Devs seem to pump out more virtual things (microtransaction things, not free) than fixes to problems. Recently many legitimate players have been getting banned for 'harrassment', and the overall active-player count has been falling. Items are insanely overpriced ($40 for a permanent virtual weapon? Come on, now), and new players usually don't stand a chance against 'hardened' veteran players. Community is pretty toxic for the most part, and the game seems to be more frustrating than fun to play. Hackers are also common.
1457	1	a	I set my balls on fire. Not in the game, I just thought I'd mention it. 10/10 like skyrim with jews.
8848	0	a	Played 1k hours Apb. Then punkbuster completely stopped letting me play for a year. Came back accounts hacked characters deleted. 10/10
7424	0	a	This may have differed now, but when I played this game, the landscape was a barren wasteland with nobody in it. (Not literally a wasteland) Also, it was hard as hell to find things to do but roam around. Half the time you would just be getting shot by other players and they are way better than you, so you can't do anything about it. It is also a GTA Clone. And by Barren I meant there were no NPC's you could ever find 2.3/10 -Wasn't Very Fun
3725	1	a	
3565	1	a	I'm pretty sure this is some of the most fun I've had with friends in a video game ever. After 1400 hours on my criminal character, countless quittings and returns, and a mind blowing amount of 4â¬ spent, I believe I can finally give an honest review. I started playing back in 2011 and had an amazing new player experience, which included me and my four friends robbing stores to gather money for a personal van. The game was in a way worse state back then, but there was still plenty to enjoy. I don't play on a regular basis anymore, but the good memories still make me visit it every few weeks.  Now, I can see what people are whining about. Not much new free content has been released in the past year. But if you are a new player, there is still plenty to experience, ESPECIALLY with friends. And yes, there are still hackers and bugs, but it seems way better than 5 years ago. The servers seem to have improved significantly, atleast on EU. While the gunplay might not be impressive for most fps players and the driving mechanics aren't on a racing sim level, the character customization and the social aspect are unlike anything I've experienced before. Starting my own clan of around 40 people, sending them all stuff to design their outfits and cars, then rolling around the district trying to approach missions tactiacally... and end up team killing everyone anyway. But looking great while doing it.  It used to be way worse than it is, and it can still be a lot better. If you are like me and are willing to ignore some of the game's flaws and learn the basics, you can be in for a lot of fun. When or if the updated engine rolls out, I recommend every player, old and new alike, to check this game out. Hopefully after that, the devs will start pushing out more new content too, because it would be a shame if such a unique concept went to waste. 
2424	1	a	This is A very good Game everyone should get this
1832	1	a	it like gta but only online 
2152	1	a	Fun game...if you are a GTA fan this game is like it.
6785	0	a	PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK  The game is filled with foul-mouthed creatures that, if you have very, very low patience, will infuriate you to no end. Despite the multitude of weapons available for free-to-play players, the best weapons you'll find will be either in the in-game marketplace costing ridiculous amounts (yes, i'm looking you all who expect so much for such a simple weapon) or in Armas Marketplace which costs real money. The lag is terrible, causing rubberbanding effect, which is very, very annoying in and out of missions. Not to mention higher level players invade the lower level ones and calls people who can't shoot them down losers or noobs. Matchmaking is bad. Low level players are often pitted against higher ranking ones.  It's not a bad game, all in all. Like many other MMORPGs, it is plague with many problems. On the up side, this game has by far the best customization I've seen out there. It's just insane with how many things you can do that you will literally spend hours just to design your clothes. There's always a lot of action going on and different faction-specific tasks you can do.  I don't recommend this game for casual players. However, if you are a fan of profanity, hours of dressing up your toon just to shoot the hell out of people, then feel free to play it.
1486	1	a	If you like GTA, you'll love this game! Lots of fun, and it's free! Just don't get too upset about those who pay to win.
4876	0	a	it cool but when you start the gravicts look like crap
4633	0	a	I love the customization and everything. The only problem is, the community is more toxic than a nuclear meltdown site, the game is clawing at your wallet 24/7, and the fighting is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Honestly, I would play it from time to time, in between 10 hour sessions of TF2 or whatever, but...well...here's the thing. I once logged on to APB, wanting to just â¥â¥â¥â¥ around for an hour or whatever. I get the infinite loading screen glitch, and I haven't been able to play since. Yes, I've gotten free stuff for waiting...BUT I CAN'T ENJOY THE FREE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING STUFF WHEN I CAN'T GET INTO A DAMN SERVER! I found there is one way to bypass this, and it's by creating a new character from scratch. Every. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing. Time. I. Want. To. Play.   I really want to like this game, I really do. But I'm not gonna spent one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cent until you fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10469	1	a	I love this game! You scavenge, harvest, craft everything yourself. If you like post apocalyptic games. this is for you. Please dont think that all you do is shoot Zombies.. as it is not that kind of setting. The world was ruined by biochemical weapons and radiation. But if you want a fun free to play game, then come join the rest of the community!!
10292	1	a	This game is sorta like the fallout series, but some very noticeable differences. you can create items from raw materials, which range from simple farming(actual farming, you know, with veggies and stuff) to badass looking vehicles (along with weapons) there are several tradeskills, such as construction, armorcraft and ballistics, skills such as, intelligence, perception etc. to level up and to benefit your playstyle, there is an auction to sell off on the worldwide auction to the highest bidder, the story is very interesting in my opinion, seeing that you are a clone that never truly stays dead. there are quests to complete, items to craft, enemies, including bosses to fight and several sectors to explore. i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of mmorpg's and post apocalyptic gaming
9346	1	a	I can't pinpoint why I enjoy this game so much, but enjoy it I do! The graphics are sub-par, causing me to hesitate through the tutorial as the controls were somewhat unintuitive and clunky at first. Keybindings can be changed, however I did manage to get used to the original controls within the first week or so.  The gameplay is a little repetitive, but I find most MMOs are. Gathering and crafting are both a large part of this game due to its survivalist nature, but combat is also significant in moving through the main story. Leveling is slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as there is substantial content in each area for you to level from.  Overall, the story line and community are both great, so if you can get past the controls and graphics on first glance, I feel like any MMO fan would enjoy this game.
8553	0	a	Good Game but Gamersfirst are a bad company, dont waste your money
3527	1	a	Amazing PvP and GTA like style with a lot of customization.
10717	1	a	A fantastic take on the FPS genre. While CTF dominates the gamemodes, it is in no way boring or dull, as the unique system of movement and variety of classes allows for constantly interesting and fast-paced gameplay. With the first patch since two years announced a few days ago I hope this game improves even further and that the community's size increases. A must play game, very fun and entertaining.
6441	0	a	what does apb even mean?  many questions need to be answered, bad game, too mysterious
8086	0	a	Just... Unplayable....
10025	0	a	great for about 12 hours of gameplay. after that even dropping money on it doesnt make it better.
10074	1	a	This game is so much fun I played it for 8 hours with out stopping.
4125	0	a	This game is so broken it doesn't even let me go throug the login screen.
7927	0	a	A horrible example of how overwhelming a pay-to-play game can get. This game is not kind at all for new players and is NOT meant for lower-end computers. The game's worlds are tiny and the missions get repetitive easily.
9240	1	a	Fun game to play for about an hour from time to time, but playing it dedicatedly just makes it boring. Bad graphics, but can be looked past. The crafting system is extremely developed and expansive. However, the game is dying at a rapid rate, and losing players, which is a shame considering how fun it used to be around one year ago when I first played it.
6812	0	a	Got banned for nothing. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
2574	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)
1753	1	a	i have been playing this game since it was not on steam, i like the game because of the customization of everything you have, car your person and guns. some people say that this game is pretty pay 2 win, whihc yes i can see that you can pay money to buy op guns, but alot of games are like that, so really it just up to personal prefrence
4354	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, enough said

803	1	a	PvP + Action + Open World + Advanture + Nudity = OH YAHH  i Really Recommend This Game   P.S: Store system really â¥â¥â¥â¥ i mean  WTF Virtual Paid Weapons And Cloths  This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t  any way i recommend this game
2388	1	a	Yes, i have a lot of fun playing this game. Should be better with friends but i didnt play with any.
8238	0	a	This game is p2w you can literally just buy the best weapon in the game with money , not even worth playing this game .
5561	0	a	This game...its just bad. It is a pay to win, lag to the max, community worse than fallout deathclaws, and just a failed product that is now just there in the garbage. The creators dont care about the people or what happens. 10/10 would not give a dam again.
1043	1	a	Great multiplayer shooter with ok ghraphics so you wont need a great computer to play. Though it is a VERY VERY glitchy game evreytime i hijack a car then go out to shoot the person they dissapear and not only that when i go to hijack a car then i see a better one i stop person dissapeared again! PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME. Would higly recomend  4.3/5
3447	1	a	Loading simulator 2015   10/10 would wait again
788	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
7487	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
3809	0	a	Greetings everyone who decides to read this Review of APB.  I'm an EX-player of APB:R after an insane amount of time and felt it was a duty to help give some advice on this game.  **NOTE: I'VE HAD AN APB ACCOUNT PREVIOUS TO THE CREATION OF MY STEAM ACCOUNT.**  The world of APB:R is immense in the sense of how whacky and fun it can be. You'll encounter strange occurances with objects (cars in this instance) interacting stupidly with other objects and it's all a joy. I've sincerely have had a lot of fun with this game. Oh! One more thing, the entire concept of APB:R being 'Pay to Win' is a complex haox from everything I've encountered in my 4 year run with APB.   How is it not Pay to Win?   Simple. All 'ARMAS' weapons you'll see in the game are typically re-skins or variations of the same weapon you can achieve with normal gameplay and progression.  Example: Joker CR Rifle is the exact same as the N-TEC and VARS-SWORD.  Many of these guns just are bought for their advantages due to their pre-set modifications which even then an ordinary player can obtain after playing for a bit of time.  The Customization is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, I've never had such a creative outlet in my life previous to APB:R. Making a fresh and beautiful designed IO: GROWL, or FireHawk Vegas or whatever car of your pleasing is one of the best things you can do in APB:R. Show it off to your fellow faction-mates and even those on the opposing side! Make your own death-theme for your victims to listen so that they know it was YOU who ended their misery. Customize your clothing, get creative with tattoos! Enjoy an environment that's not restricted to just PRE-SET PRE-DESIGNED decals like most games would have.  Wait! This review is NOT recommending this game why?  Over the last couple of weeks, something has been happening. Something that has been triggering/messing with player-base. The ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM: FAIRFIGHT, in addition to the formerly used PUNKBUSTER, has been flagging players, both cheaters and non-cheaters, and respectfully banning the player in question.  Isn't that a good thing?  Well, I'd suppose it would be a good thing that the anti-cheat system is actually banning people and actively detecting the use of horrid third-party programs and the lot, but, what about those who were non-cheaters?  I'm one of those players.  I'm formerly known as the criminal: xShadowscythe.  A few days ago, I logged into the game I've loved for so long, entered a match, and as I was driving to my next destination BANNED.  Oh? Banned? You could just open a ticket to GamersFirst, maybe they'll help you out?   NOT AT ALL.  Although the game is fantastic and such, the company that hosts the game is unwilling to clarify/justify/assist any of it's players with any information regarding to why they were banned.  Upon sending an email to the support staff, I've been handed an automated letter and have not been given any insight onto why I was banned from the game other than 'Someone has been conducting suspicious activity that violates our Terms of Service.' Upon a request for clarification or for a reason I was promptly sent away and denied with yet another automated message.  For those who have read this review and thinking of still playing APB:R  I sincerely hope you give the game a shot and help in it's resurrection, but please be aware of the corruption and malfunctioning system in place as of OCTOBER 31ST, 2016. I sincerely hope you all have a good time in the game and will leave this review with one final piece of advice.  Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time. Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.  Love,   xShadowscythe.
6725	0	a	First i would like to say this is one of the best games out there despite the Pay for more mindset of this game. costumization is crazy deep detailed but the default substcription you carry as a new player limits you to 25% of this games costumization capabilities. that aside there is also very anoying mechanics in this game specially playing as a bandit or criminal. a enforcer can handcaff you from miles away limiting your abillity to fight back or even try to brake restrains. little things like this are game braking. i havent spent much time in this game to give you a detailed idea of everything in this game. another thing that really bothers me is the community simply because its mostly filled with a very young community fan base. it bothers me i have to go online and play with 10 year olds. this game has the potencial to be the best game on steam for GTA fans and i think if taken in the right direction it would surpass GTA in many ways. i recommend it for a casual gamer not someone thats looking to take the most out of this game becouse that? .... well thats just impossible unless you â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold bars.......
2782	1	a	wow much shooter
102	1	a	+ It's a good game, graphics are amazing and it's multiplayer. - It's hard to drive and make actions. + Criminals makes easy cash - Enforcers steal your stuff to earn cash on it + Private Cars - Public vehicles can be stolen from you with the loot in + Free to play +++ BRUTAL multiplayer game with Constant action all the time  Rating: 7/10 Additional comment: The gameplay is awesome, I love this game. There are only 2 things that annoyes me: #1: Other people stealing your car if it's not private... #2: Enforcers busting you in action... They can easily catch you up if you don't have driving skills
2568	1	a	awesome fun.Lots of players andd missions.customizing is amazing
10720	1	a	It was fun until it decided to stop working permanently despite three or four re-installations. Tech support gave me some weird pain in the â¥â¥â¥ thing to do that involved finding some file somewhere and changing a number or deleting it or creating it, I didn't do it I don't care â¥â¥â¥â¥ your stupid game.  Also the game is pretty fun.

8840	0	a	Updated Review 2016 - The bloom in this game is awful, picture this...fingerprints all over your phone screen and then smudged. That is what you can expect to see while playing this game. Now once you get past the dated graphics the actual core of the game is fun..provided you don't mind PVP. Tons of customization options to your character and your items. Sadly the Armas Market (real currency required to purchase vehicle body kits, guns, weapon skins etc..) is very pricey. The real bad part is the insane amount of cheaters since this is a free to play game...you can expect to come across them daily and just about every other match. The anti cheat detection system is fairfight and some in-house countermeasures....all of which puts its fair share of catching and banning them on a daily basis. SO dated graphics, gnarly amount of cheaters, expensive market place...and a toxic community are what you can expect here..oh and I shouldn't forget this game's developer has an uncanny knack for UNBANNING hackers/cheaters which really should deter you from investing any amount of time and money into this game.

5792	0	a	This game could be so good. But. greedy devs, bad community, no community, P2W, no beginner support, lack of playable content, no new content, laughable matchmaking, small maps, few maps, free guns suck, free guns are temporary, level system sucks, unlockables are well locked, ect... I could go on probably but whats the point its all written in other reviews. I do hope some how, some way, this game gets put in the hands of people more capable and returned to the relm of f2p, because unless all you plan to do is customize you character or melody or clothes or car or emblems, ect... you have to Pay to Win. I cant reccomend a game that cant be played. So hurry up and fix it!

227	1	a	APB Reloaded is a mass-multiplayer 'sorta open world' third person shooter/objective based game. I find it very fun in my opinion and even better when you're playing online with a good group of friends. The objectives vary, and I find them enjoyable as well as not too reptetative, the only problem I think this game has is that the enforcer role seems to be a little too OP when they are equiped with a tazer/stun gun. I know people counter this by stating that criminals do make money quicker, but I still think that the stun gun is rather unfair. However, this is just my opinion and someone else may feel differently towards it. But, if massive-multiplayer, online, third-person shooters sounds exciting to you, than this game is perfect.

9836	0	a	Looking at this, I was expecting a Fallout-ish experience. I was mistaken, but not by much. Don't let the play time fool you, I played a good 50 hours of this outside of Steam. Pros: -Crafting -Exploration -Factions -Multiple starts -Many weapons -Steampunk feel -Reminiscent of New Vegas without being a clone -Very open  Cons: -Glitchy -Crafting system is a bit confusing -PvP is populated almost entirely by hackers -Optimizatin is â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Players are generally ill-tempered -AI isn't verry Intelligent -Quests can be a handful at times -Aiming likes to twitch, making long-range shots hard -Leveling system is a pain  Neutral: -Tutorial can be a bit confusing on your first run through -Graphics are a bit dated -Kinda empty (Not sure if they're going for the 'Wasteland' feel)  Overall, it's fun to play with friends for a week or two, but not something I'd sink another 50 hours into
9886	1	a	This game has really great atmosphere. That is because most of the content is ripped straight from the Wasteland/Fallout universe. If you ever wanted to play a Fallout-ish MMO, this is the best choice. It's more focused on crafting and the whole 'carrot on the stick' gameplay, and of course you can just buy the carrot. I really enjoyed the short time I spent in game.  I'm torn about this game because, quite frankly, the community is just awful. Instead of Zone chat like in most mmo's, there's a Help chat. It's filled with players that have been there for a while, but most of them have that whole 'elite' attitude. Help chat is supposed to be used for people with questions, thus the name. These 'Elitists' will use Help chat for anything they want, berate and accuse new players of trolling, then turn around and lecture everyone on the 'proper way' to use Help chat. The GM's are even worse. They constantly hand out mutes/bans, but ignore any complaints towards the preffered players that have been there for a long time or spent probably $500 in the cash shop.   Also, the GM's are crazy about censoring peoples' screen names. I had a name that wasn't even offensive, I played for a bit and when I came back, my name was Cupcake1244. Yes, if they deem your name offensive, you get to roam the Wastelands as Cupcake____. And you only get 1 character slot as a F2P player. I contacted a GM about changing my name and guess what? Oh, you can BUY a name change in the cash shop. $10 because you got offended for no reason? Hah!  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that's going to argue right back with you when you're acting douchey. So I told everyone off in Help chat and am uninstalling :)   To sum it up, if you enjoy the crafting side of mmo's with a Fallout/Wasteland atmosphere, go for it. But if you're not going to spend money on it, I'd suggest that you keep the chat window closed and just chat with people locally. You're going to want to avoid these Basement-Dwellers.

4696	0	a	This game is a bunch of bull crap. People with pay to play weapons, percs, tricked out vechiles ruining your day as you a wee low level try to get one perc. Hackers have kinda been dealt with but still some. Used to be a huge horde of hackers. Game can kinda get addicting if you manage to get atiny bit good or have high level clan mates to carry you. And 'DLC', Pay to win weapons, car decorations are stupidly expensive. Complete waste of your money.You could be spending it on better things. Would not recommend.
5973	0	a	i cant get the dang thing to load :( 
3031	1	a	I've played APB for about 2 years. I see alot of negative review concerning the game regarding poor matchmaking, bugs, hacking and most of all the community. To be honest I could not see APB nor could I enjoy playing it the same way if it weren't for those things. You are in a game where you can make yourself look however you want. Literally I've seen people walk around gunning people with what looked like underwear with a giant brown stain and a party hat. I've seen people paint masterpieces on the sides of cars and vans alike. I've seen people put so much detail in their characters they stand out no matter what. Everyone stands out somehow. You have your own personal touch that people will recognize. Your shirt, your car, your tie, your makeup or a tattoo. The customization on this game is endless and you can even make your own MIDI songs ingame. Sure they won't be pop quality songs but how many games can do that today in the MMO field?   Matchmaking is good the way it is simply because there are people who are on a higher tier than other players and pick on the newbies. This game is brutal concerning that one detail... Its f*** or die and granted that is sad but this is not a game that will spoon feed you skills nor will it hold your hand till you can walk by yourself. You can't just click a button or two to make your problems disappear. The more you play the more you will understand that it all comes down to two things. Skill and teamwork, with an emphasis on teamwork. The hardest, toughest mother*****r can be killed with teamwork that is guaranteed. However there will be times when its all you under the spotlight vs three other people and only 30 seconds left on the clock to finish the mission... You will probably fail but sometimes you will be able to shine. Once you put such a high bar in a game the satisfaction of winning is increased ten fold.  Now regarding the community... I want everyone for just a moment to understand something. This is a game where you either pretend to be a criminal or a vigilante (neither have a problem killing pedetrians at will). Its also an FPS game with things like 'lootable' money. Also let us not forget this is the internet... Do you really think everyone is gona be nice or play nice? People will insult you, they will hate you, they will bother you, hell if they could they would perma crash all your cars, steal your money and leave you without clothes. However... Every world is the same town, there are good people and there are bad people. I've met decent human being on APB who were not hell bent on defecating on your gaming experience. The community of APB in my mind is exactly how San Pedro would be if such a situation ever existed. Besides I personal find satisfaction being s**t talked by the entire opposition for 30min after I win the game.   To conclude this game is not for everyone and it requires a bit getting used to. If you read this review and decide to give it a shot don't worry about sucking at this game. Even after you become the proest of them all, to someone (or a few people) you will always be a 'noob' ;).  9/10 They don't get my full vote because I'd very much like to see new maps from time to time xD

7459	0	a	Much of the UI for character creation work sporadically at best. You get dumped in at a spawn point with no idea what to do. My spawn point was/appeared to be a bank. Peopl ran in and started shooting and I couldn't tell who was on what side. Makes a game with two factions difficult when you don't know what side the players are on.
8911	0	a	This game just sucks â¥â¥â¥. Devs aren't going to fix anything. Ai can heal them self to full health instantly if they want, They can jump to roofs and run trough walls and hit you from 100m distance with a melee weapon. This game is not worth your time, don't even try it.
4762	0	a	  This game is a sespool of juvenile players.
3519	1	a	Everytime there's an update, it is harder to get into the game ... HALP. XD
9364	0	a	The game got boring pretty quickly, I'm not sure if I like the story line or not. But if you are the type of person who loves apocalyptic games, you should try this one out to see if you enjoy it, but there's a high chance you will be disappointed. IMO, this game is not for me.
188	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs. There were alot of bugs in the earlier version but they are mostly fixed. New patches and updates are coming so the game won't get boring for a while. The game looks good and even with minium settings
7787	0	a	So let's get this rolling.  This game is addictive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ due to being just so much fun at the lower levels but when you progress your threat changes and you will be placed with much harder opponents. The problem is there is no required level for this threat, meaning low level players can reach the highest threat level and then they are for the most part â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. You face enemies that have so much stuff or spend real money on the game that you just get face rolled.   Which doesn't help the match making, that's broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥. At late game you get placed into such unfair matches that it releases the devil inside you. Placing you in games with unbalanced amount of players or threat level. We were two silver threat levels playing against 2 highest level gold threat players and being facerolled.  Then there is the problem of Pay 2 Win. This game has the most OP Pay to win system I have ever seen. You can buy the max level guns and items at any level, meaning you get players just owning you at lower threats and levels. These guns can be obtained (Sort of) at the highest level but just think for a moment, low level players with end game guns....  Now for servers. The servers are for the most part fine, the problem is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way the game uses the servers. Almost everything is server side, so lag? Tough â¥â¥â¥â¥. You're going to crash and backtrack the whole time, also the server side thing doesn't work for international players as they have delayed â¥â¥â¥â¥ing everything. Delayed controls on vehicles, delayed hit detection, delayed death and damage. Making the game feel like a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The Weapons in the game are for the most part good except for the OP Premium guns that are sold on the market. The guns expire every 10 days and they don't cost a high amount but the problem is that the Guns you pay â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money for also expire, although the period is 30 days instead of 10. So when you come back after taking a break from the game, you'll find out that you have no weapons and have thrown more money at the game to unlock those weapons that are required to even win matches.  The game's customization is simply amazing, the company that owns the game host events for artists to create new works of art for the game and if they win they get allowed to sell it on the premium store, but the problem here is you have to pay to be able to make anything. That's right, you have to pay for fonts, icons, decals and much more to be able to make something. Anyway to skip that part is to buy vehicles or clothes that are on the market and have been customized. Lastly there is the way this game makes you rage, with the lag and the pay 2 win style, the most anoying part is when you die, you get played a taunt from the enemy that can be really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anoying. This game has made me rage so much on my friends that we stopped playing it.  In the end, I wonder why I even played this game for so long.
9447	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
8949	0	a	All of my expectations about this game has failed after i played . If you like games like warcraft or fallout ...meh maybe you can play .But if  you were expecting some action based game , this is not what you  are looking for .
5773	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
3692	1	a	i played the game for 12 hours and i think to my self this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fun canda game for poeple like me of mmo's and mmorpg's and moba's i don't like the game but i like a bit of it i grown on me to play the game i hope the fix the car's driving error's that i have who can drive like that i recommend playing it on your own risk if you like this game i like to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with this game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ all the player 'up' and ya msg me if you like it but not realy like it

1096	1	a	it's a game that exists, isn't that good enough?                                    really you'd only play this for the customization, but that's besides the point
354	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is 'cheating', most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.  I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.  Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.  See you in San Paro!

6931	0	a	This game helped me learn that being cooperative and working together is the key to success.  Unfortunately, none of this happens. You either get called a noob, hacker, or just get frustrated.... Because in the end, all you will hear is the sound of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ quality music playing through your teammates mic.   The only reason you should play this game is if you have friends that will play with you. This game is nothing without cooperation.   For these reasons I do not recommend this game.
9994	1	a	Much improved bugwise in recent times. Truly f2p, but you will benefit from subscribing (crafting wise.) Lot to be said PvP wise here, but PvE is more meh. Fun cash shop, but a bit overpriced. Fun to just solo and fart around which is rare in MMOs. If you like crafting this is your Huckleberry.
1473	1	a	This game is so much fun! I find it fun for a free game and i dont like free games.

74	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 
10309	1	a	Allo poppets, anuva reveiw...  So... Fallen Earth, an MMORPG set in post-apocalyptic america, original I know, but the the game itself is, actually quite unique, if a bit lacking in areas. Having only limited tim on this one so far I can say this for sure, it could be so much more than its is, visually and in actual gameplay. Thats not to say it isnt still a good game and enjoyble thus far.  The storyline seems fairly original (to me at least), and the character creation is fairly in depth, skills and progression of characters are simple and fairly rapid, but the thing that really set this one apart is the XP system which i will describe in detail below.  In Fallen Earth you start as a clone in a lab and must 'break free', but once you are free of the lab, the wasteland of the Grand Canyon, USA, has much to offer in the way of chr. progression options, meaning you dont have to be a warrior, or combatant of any kind (though you will need to be able to defend yourself), you can make a living and progress in Lvl &amp; skill by travelling the wastes and scavenging, harvesting and collecting supplies and refuse of all kind, and, either crafting/building things from them or just selling them.  The combat and equipment system is pretty cool (although complicated at first), as you can choose a wide array of weaponry to equip and even use in combination i.e; Pistol in one hand and blade in the other or sword and axe etc., which I found very fun. Most weapons and armour can be crafted with the neccessary skill, and clothing/armor can even be dyed for an extra touch of personalisation.  There are also many Mounts, pets, and vehicles to accompy you, or be used throughout your travels in the wastes, and you don't have to pay real money to get them, though the best ones are only on the market. Nor do you have to pay real cash to get/tame pets, just spend game 'chips'(the currency of the wastes) to get the corresponding item, i.e; Wasteland Hound Leash will allow you to obtain/tame a dog/wolf pet.  The only downside as I touched on earlier is the fact that its very 'un-polished' thus far, some part of dialogue texts are even grossly miss-spelt or nonsensical, and it gets a little glitchy in some areas, especially when there is a heavy populatio of players in-game. This lack of 'finesse' does detract quite a bit from the game, however, as you can see the great potential this title has, hopefully coming updates will fix these issues.  When alls said and done this is , at least, worth a look due to the involved Role-play aspect and wide exploration capabilities, just dont expect a highly polished experience...  I'm rating it 5.5 out of 10 Red Poker Chips
9091	1	a	pretty good game wish more users
5970	0	a	This game WAS worth consider playing, with gta-like elements and Wide range of customizations from clothing to vehicles and death themes and more .....but the pvp matchmaking is terrible AND with the type of weapons the devs allowed has made the type of 'fair game' disappeared. If you want to play this game with a much enjoyable mood then buying certain things from the game is recommended...I play it only if i have no games left to play.
3595	1	a	Its nice and fun game to play with friends. But the support is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9795	1	a	apperently im allowed to post a review even though ive never played this.
4290	0	a	How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons.   This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.  The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.  This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...  The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!

9123	1	a	OMG! Guys if you like Post-Appocolyptic things then this is your game. It is so fun with real plays even though there is still NPC's and Mobs. It has missions to do and the XP to rank up to lvl 55! Now i know some people might say that, 'are you kidding? lvl 55 will take forever!' But seriously not, I've played this game for a month and got to lvl 55 and to do so all you have to do is kill loot and sell and get a good clan to get some new friends and hang out in the Wasteland. It has all kinds of cool looking armor and weapons but here ammo can become scarce sometimes if you dont watch how much u have. BUt anyway I would want all you appocolypse fans to play this it is realy worth the download.

When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
4215	0	a	Pay2Win system of weapons
2691	1	a	Awesome cops and robbers style gameplay that pits criminals against enforcers. Crims get to ram-raid shops for quick cash and Enforcers get to use 'less than lethal' (LTL) weapons to bring an enemy in alive by arresting them for more points and cash, along with 'witnessing' crimes by pressing ALT on a criminal commiting a crime in order to get a bounts mission on them.  Overall a great game with tons of customization options and a wide variety of weapons.  A solid third person shooter with a solid style.  9/10 [Mersey seal of approval.]

You'll see that this is totaly Fu cked up, Pay2Win, BUT, you also can play with some redeem codes realy well at the start. It's not the best game but also not the worst GTA knock off, Watch_Dogs is worse than that. But, the commiunety is full of As s holes! You want to play a mission 'n win that damn missions, and Your own Team mates are killing You cuz You want to win the mission 'n earn money 'n help 'em. -10/10.
6823	0	a	For me the game wasn't smooth enough it needs to be worked on a little more
4995	0	a	Character creation was fun.  That was all the fun this game had to offer.  Edit: Honestly, yeah, I'm an APB scrub-- and for a reason. This game is purely all show and no go just as much as it is a pay-to-win scheme of a game. (And based on your hours, I guess you fell for that.)   The developers would much rather keep their blockheaded playerbase happy with updates that exclusively include more guns rather than EVER updating the game's engine or fixing/ adding onto APB's bland as balls gameplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, I guess I can see that driving around and doing the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again could be amusing to some people. But I feel like that's just a very small demographic of likeminded people who require little to no mental stimulation.   This game literally offers nothing new or innovative and the hours you'll spend on it before realizing that there's nothing more to it, are spent making up characters or customizing other things.   I don't know. Say what you will, but every other review for this game just rolls over the same points I just made.   TL:DR I'm a scrub but this game still sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥.  Abridged Version for the APB: Reloaded Playerbase:  'yo, y u spendin' yo money on dis gaem when dere nothing 2 do lmao dis girl buggy as hell an she aint got no game, playa.' 
3579	1	a	I have no clue what I'm doing, but its OK.   I'm having fun while doing it.
8630	0	a	I'll probably get lynched for saying this, but there's nothing to do in this game. In addition to the lack of activity, the two main elements of the game - driving and shooting - feel cheap, weird and unrewarding. There's a big fan following though, so you might like it. I didn't.
2210	1	a	What could be better you can drive cars, shoot pedestrians, and robs stores! And for the people who say this is a bad game try playing it now!
7585	0	a	mehhhh â¥â¥â¥ not really i dunno  is it good? nah could I GET INTO A SERVER? NO
9110	1	a	Nice simple apocolyptic game. Few small kinks but I'm sure with few patches and graphics update will look really nice in the long run.
2434	1	a	Not best but could play when bored
7302	0	a	In the basic a real nice game with a solid gameplay and good mechanics.  Also the mission design is great with a lots of varieties.  But... The progress in this game is rather difficult due to the overhelming 'buyable' content. I had a lot of fun playing this game, but in the end was frustrated as i get killed by players with weapons you can't unlock through simply playing this game.  This game could have great potential to be a really great f2p game, but the unbalanced content, also the frustration you will experience while playing against some players who take all the posible buyable benefits, negate all positive experience.   In the end i do not recommend this game, unless you are willing to spend some $$ for a faster/better armored car and a weapon which is more accurate and does more damage than the free counterpart.   My last opinion on this. If there would be no buyable content (cars/weapon) but only cosmetical content like clothes etc. This would be a great game as a f2p. Right now it's one of the most wicked pay 2 win games i played in the last months

7317	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.

10064	0	a	This game was a good idea, but is one of the worst games I have ever played in my life!!! I had more fun playing E.T.
4547	0	a	This game is so pay2win u wouldn't believe it which is very sad considering the awesome customization options and decent gun-play.I really wanted to like this game but the lack of PvE means you will get your butt handed to you almost every mission you play, because of someone that spent like 100$ on this cash grab.It can be fun when playing with friends sometimes but that happens very rarely. Stay AWAY from APB Reloaded, you are better off playing Warframe,Defiance or Firefall.
8860	1	a	How to do a review for a game that you spent over 3000 hours playing? Could it be objective? Hardly. But i will try at my best to keep it real as much as it is possible. First off, this game is not old. Its ancient.  Graphics  are, by todays standards, in world that saw titles such as Crysis, CoD:AW, Battlefield or Witcher series, laughable at best. It looks old, it ''plays'' old, but it has some of its charm for it.  Story ? Interesting, starting parts are very cohesive, but later on its starts to be very watered down.  Gameplay ? That depends solely on player. There are multiple things you could do ingame (crafting, pvp, pve, farming, exploring, ect), and it works well on its part, but some features definately need to be worked on. I could spend hours explaining each part separately, but generally, game has complex crafting system, pve is fun as far pve goes in other games (there are bosses, instances, dungeons, team raids, ect), farming and harvesting are nice way of getting materials in large quantities if you dont mind posibility of being attacked while doing so (depending on place where you farm/harvest). Over the course of playing i met lot of interesting people. Some were nice, some were not, but all around, Fallen Earth has (or had) one of best comunities around in MMO's. There is always someone who will help out new player, give some usefull advice, share money, resources or items. There are also individuals who organise various community events. One of biggest problems most post apocalyptic games have is that they are constantly being measured towards Fallout universe games. That is a problem, since most games do not measure up to Fallout. Fallen Earth is one of games that comes very, very close to that. Not the same, but not too much diferent from it. Each of those games has its own pros and cons. Sadly, at current time, it seems that G1 (company who owns FE) isnt too much interested in adding new things (although they do occasionally, but not to extent from before), but we always hope they will come to their senses and finish polishing the diamont that Fallen Earth is, and make it shine as it should.

1050	1	a	Eh. It's ok I guess.
3367	1	a	It's basically a poor man's GTA Online. The character creator is suprisingly in-depth for some reason. I can't speak for whether it's pay-to-win or not as I never actually bothered looking at the cash shop.
2818	1	a	Bears similiarities to Saints Row and GTA, steep learning curve but alot of fun. This game has been going strong for a while now and though progress is slow it is being update constantly, a whole new area has been added as well as multiple items which can be had at not actual cost. This game is the very formula for a proper F2P, there is no pay to win and should you chose to purchase a weapon or vehicle be certain you shop wisely since each is well suited to a particular playstyle.
7679	0	a	This game is NOT noob friendly. in APB reloaded, there is no sign of matchmaking whatsoever. it just compiles a random clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of people to duke it out. which means if you're just starting out, you could easily be placed against someone who's been playing nonstop for months repeatedly. I tried to get on my feet in that game for 3 days, but every cent I earned went toward ammo or was lost in deaths to people who play nonstop and pay actual money for the good equipment.   also, I dare say that this is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. even more so than Call of Duty. I don't get angry easily, but this game angered me to the point where I threw my mouse across the room and shattered the damn thing. So, here's a warning. if you're angered easily, AVOID APB RELOADED  It's a shame, because the idea behind it had a lot of potential. I was really excited to see someone finally making a game like this where you could actually be the cop with custom cars and weapons. It had so much potential, but the absolutely terrible matchmaking and blatantly obvious pay to win strategy ruined the entire thing for me.  long story short: unless you're willing to spend an untold amount of hours on this game, all it's going to do is infuriate you. it's a gigantic avoid from me.

5	1	a	If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients - To Make the Dough 375 grams (3 cups) plain flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1/4 cup (50 ml / 3Â½ tablespoons) olive oil 1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water Extra flour for dusting    - To Make Cheese Filling 15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese 5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) '3 Cheese Italian Blend' (Parmesan, Romano &amp; Asiago) Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend. 1/2 cup cheddar cheese 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper   - Extras Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana) Parmesan cheese Basil Fried vegetables Shrimp Fish slices Chicken pieces  Make the Ravioli filling.  - In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork. - Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper. - Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency. - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.   Make the Ravioli dough.  - Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix. - Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. - Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. - Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. - Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. - With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles). - Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesnât suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.   Fill the Ravioli shells.  - Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. - Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. - Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a âhomemadeâ touch as well. - Repeat this process for all your dough circles. - Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.   Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.  - Roll the dough into two sheets - Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups. - Fill with the ravioli mixture. - Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. - Remove and separate the finished raviolis.  Cook the Ravioli.  - Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. - Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. - If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest  - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates  Serve it up. Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

3222	1	a	great game ive always wanted grand theft auto v but this can work the same as it so yeah 
7818	0	a	If you want to have fun then this is the perfect example of a game not to play.
62	1	a	Jesus guys. I'm just going to be honest with you- stop looking for bad reviews. Its a free to play game, so just download it and play it. If you don't like it, then delete it. What is the worst that could happen anyways?  The hackers? Ok now for real, there are hackers in like every game. I even met an aim-bot hacker in CS:GO. So stop complaining about the hackers because any game can be easily hacked.  Oh, so you just spawned in and you died by a grenade? Big deal! Someone buys CS:GO and gets sniped by an AWP they automatically refund the game? No! They just get better at the game. And if you really need it just click on the 'Advanced' option while picking a district and click on one with a green orb next to it.  So just get the game and if you don't like it delete it.

6114	0	a	This game was a waste of time. The game is all based on money and how much money you wanna waste. He's a few 'bad' things about the game. I missed some. -Bad updates (The game was better a few years back)Â¨ -Time limited items -Money grinding only gives 30 day items -Expensive DLCs (You are not EA!) -Bad textures -Bad matchmaking system -Money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs -Pay to win And i could do that in ages. The point is.. dont waste your time and life on this. There is many way better games out there. Alot of you might disagre with me at some points. But its a review. This is what i think! (I played this a few years back and now i begun to play it again and never knew it  became that bad!   UPDATE!: I played the game to see if i could find more reasons the game SUCKS heres some.  -Even more Pay2Win -Expensive gear -Invinsible objects and doors -Bad servers -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Matchmaking -Only weapon and clothes updates -Expensive DLCs (They should be a fair price even if they weren't on sale)  Enjoy them..

3490	1	a	all i want to say is two things i think this game needs that might have made me play it more than i have  -1 it need a way where people who dont want to pay can earn cars through missions or just have a way that we can have more possible features if we dont pay.  -2the map is small like really small  i might change my mind it depends f the game changes.
9879	1	a	I've had so much fun running around, picking up bits of plastic :)

799	1	a	Definately has a GTA feel to it, but with insane customization, while it is fun to play free, I would 100% reccomend buying premium, however, G1, the company that owns the game, is completly money hungry as well as a tad â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as far as sever connection goes, but even with this, it is still a game that is very addictive, and very fun!

Litreally you cannot go more than 20 seconds without lag and this isnt an individual problem, no this effects everyone playing  -lag? check -pay to win? check -driving thats worse than Ride To Hell? check -hackers? CHECK â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CHECK  I really like this game but oh my sweet jesus ive never played a game so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing laggy and easy to hack in my life even god damn CoD5 servers are in better condition than this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Its a damn shame that this awsome game is ruined by such â¥â¥â¥â¥ing useless employies who are down right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid to use anti hack systems that are 10 YEARS OLD! and never maintain there â¥â¥â¥â¥ing servers.  Untill they fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥ I give it a 3/10 because of how frequent lag and hackers are and IF they fix it I will give it an 7.5/10 thats how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad the lag and hackers are, and thats saying something.
4052	0	a	A Dreadful P2Win game that isnt even remotley balanced. New players will find it damn near impossible to even go toe to toe with oposing faction. Server experiences frequent and crippling rubbanding lag.
1622	1	a	i love to play this game 
2835	1	a	APB Reloaded, pretty fun MMO. I enjoyed the time I played it. I recently stopped playing it. Idk why. It got really boring after a while. Pretty much this is a Grand Theft Auto MMO. Which I was excited about! Grinding for money also got boring. The game was really p2w. All the good weapons you had to pay money for. I recommend this game to GTA and sandbox type game fans. Just try it out, you might get bored, you might keep playing it!
2564	1	a	Fun game to play with friends
6865	0	a	It was really good when It first came out. but It wasn't even THAT good. It was certainly something new and innovative for it's time but now its just a pay2win cash cow with the occasional cheater mixed in on top of the already nearly impossible to beat pay2win crowd. It still has some awesome features unrelated to the main game such as the customization of your character. (see my publics screenshots on this game to get an idea) You can have your own crew, and cars customized to match. There are ton's of cool guns and lots of cars. You can make friends in the game and just chill out at the social district, or race around the city. But these days not many people play and the streets are mostly empty. which isn't really the games fault. It's just older now. If you like highly customizable games and you have some friends to play with, I would say give it a shot. but for the average player who want's to just enjoy the core game, I would say look somewhere else. preferably at the new Grand Theft Auto.
735	1	a	A nice third person shooter that pits two factions against eachother in mission-based PVP. One of GamersFirst's finest in my opinion. You can gain standing through completing missions for contacts and climbing up in the ranks. Earn guns, clothing, cars, and more as you increase your standing and move up in the city of San Paro. There are three districts, the Financial district, the Waterfront distrect, and the Social district. The Financial and Waterfront district are the two main districts that use the PVP system. The Social district is where people go to sell items on the in game marketplace, pimp out their character, or just hang out. Overall I think APB Reloaded is a great game and I recommend it to all.
9894	0	a	Made 3 accounts and its still not working. I hate this anti-DRM â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. ITS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING F2P SO WHY DO I NEED A G1ST PROFILE?
3161	1	a	Because far out character creation, actual teamplay, and shooting stuff.
6766	0	a	The game has potential but like so many other Free-To-Play games it suffers from poor performace, Pay-To-Win players, and several game breaking bugs such as exploitable invisible walls and suceptibility to aim-bots amongst other hacks. The game has so much potential to be fun, and to make the dev's money if they would just put in the effort to make the game fair and balanced. The matchmaking system is broken as well. The district you choose is supposed to match you against equally skilled opponents, but in a world full of hacks cheats and obnoxious children this hardly makes a difference. You will get matched up against pros every time because they are the only players left as the new players get scared away by everything I just mentioned.

4272	0	a	I have played this game when it was released. Paid somewhere between 100 to 500 USD on items, upgrades, extra's, you name it. I had a wonderful time playing this game. Until... I got banned. I sended a ticket to support and they said that I got caught cheating which is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, because I was livestreaming on Twitch.tv and anybody saw how I played and how my opponents played.  I even sended the following proof of someone using an aimbot who had 51 kills 7 deaths :   http://imageshack.com/a/img922/9103/0DtOEP.png   http://imageshack.com/a/img923/1844/mMXMvK.png  But they didn't care. I checked for APB Aimbot on Youtube and I found tons of videos of people using an aimbot in the game and they still play in the game based on the date they publish their brand new hack video compared to legit players, paid or not paid for extra items, gets banned with no reason what so ever.  This was somewhere in the year 2012. 4 years later I write my review to help others not to buy this game.  It's up to you if you want his game or not. Check the reviews 15k positive vs 7k negative.

I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good â¥â¥â¥â¥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
1971	1	a	^^
10489	1	a	Good game play. Need to improve on stash and inventory.
3685	1	a	Please, update car physics
463	1	a	This game is so much fun to play with your friends, make a gang, rob stores, or make a police patrol and kill bad guys, so nice and it's free !
8706	0	a	great game, however, still awful controller support, down right unplayable for those who don't use keyboard and mouse
9903	0	a	In the grim darkness of future, there is only war. But not here. Here, you will find a desolate land with funny people running around, lame excuses of a storyline, traces of developers' sloth and indifference, ancient graphics, grinding and... Long story short: I've played worse. But that's hardly a recommendation.
10229	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
1093	1	a	Tons of fun, once you get past the learning curve and actually understand the game its awesome. Recommended to play with friends.
9883	1	a	A great free to play MMO which has elements similar to games like Fallout and Fallout New Vegas, it also gives the choice of third or first person perspective. It also has vehicles such as motorbikes and also horses. A great free to play MMO experience overall.
10134	1	a	Only have about 6 or so hours into this game but so far, I'm loving it. For the price, you can't get much better. In reading the other reviews before getting this game, I saw a lot of mention of this being the 'poor man's Fallout' game. Being a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, I find this to be mostly accurate, but it doesn't live up the the actual play of this game. It has a lot of what made the Fallout series great, and expands on what Fallout could have been, had it been made into a MMO. It also seems to be much more detailed when it comes to the scavenging and character building aspects. For what it is, I really couldn't ask for more. Once I get another 20 or 30 hours in, I will revisit this reveiw with a little more info and detail.
2707	1	a	For being a cop or criminal, this is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. It is one of the funnest games I've played and I totally reccomend it to you. It can be hilarious in various ways. So get a muscle car and ramp off â¥â¥â¥â¥. Go have fun.
9716	0	a	Not even worth downloading. Its impossible to play 5 minutes without it freezing up your computer. I even set a timer on it. It actually freezes after exactly 5 minutes of gameplay. Wierd.
6055	0	a	Lags as â¥â¥â¥â¥, horrible pay to win, and too much g1c for a single weapon. Would play again.
5104	0	a	Booty Game It Sucks P2W TO THE MAX Bad Mechanics U New U Suck thats life in this game 
9120	1	a	I've never played this but steam says I have so here is my review. This game is playable. (i think)
2549	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fast paced, shoot em up, Free to play, open world strategy combat MMO; and if you are any good at it, you hate it with a passion.   I recommend it.
2685	1	a	awesome game, hard to play, hard to master, so if you want a challenge play this
1860	1	a	Its like GTA with a few differences but its fun as hell... If you can get it to work
4297	0	a	The Pay 2 Win is Real in this one.
6891	0	a	...
5011	0	a	not as good as it could be, confusing and uninteresting after 3 hours it gets repetative.
3154	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
1207	1	a	It is so so.
5411	0	a	When I downloaded it, it didn't even work for me, and I have a Windows 10.
9704	0	a	can't even login.
9127	0	a	10/10 Would uninstall again!
9827	0	a	never played 10/10
6163	0	a	Doesn't work. It keeps going into this update window but it never plays the actual game. Waste of time downloading this...
8179	0	a	Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros in this glitchy, slow GTA-Wannabe.
4782	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks â¥â¥â¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.
10686	1	a	Actual gameplay: 11/10 Other crap that comes with that: 0/10 This game is made by hi-rez, a company with a history of creating and abandoning their games after a couple years or so. They ditched global agenda for tribes, then ditched tribes for smite. So essentially it has gone un updated for years causing the player base to be very low and the cheaters to be somewhat common (It won't ruin the experience but you may see one every few days, just switch servers).  Conclusion: Possibly best game I have ever played, insane skillcap, insane speedcap, weapons mastery unlimited and super rewarding, but at this point its hard to start getting into it because of the lack players and dev work. Even though My steam profile doesn't say it I have played over 1000 steam hours of this (they reset when I reinstalled it) and an unknown number of hours playing it off the non steam launcher. If this series was rebooted or the game was updated I would certainly get back on it but until then ill stick to other stuff.
9577	0	a	Fallout is awesome! Oh, wait this isn't Fallout? Oh yeah it's 'Fallen Earth' don't buy that â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4104	0	a	If you are not willing to spend $1500.00 on the game then dont get it. Its a P2P community where the kids cant earn anything so they steal their moms credit card and buy all the more powerful weapons.   While the players who want to play without putting any real money into the game have to use crappy guns with crappy accuracy, and the only way to get anything decent (Which you can only have for a short period of time) takes months of grinding. Ive played this game for 119.3 hrs and only gotten just over $17000.00 ingame cash. Which doesn't get you anything good if you were wondering.   This game is a waste of time and there are many other games out there that beat this one in overall performance and quality of the community, I give this game a -100 out of 10 due to its lack of free to play compatability ingame and its lack of a mature and friendly community, all I see in this game is a bunch of rich 10 year olds who get their parents to give them $500 allowance a week to spend on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  For your own sake and the sake of you're mental ability to play and have fun.   Dont download this game, play minecraft or something, which overall is a million times better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ show.
84	1	a	Game that used to be brilliant 2 years ago turned into something many wish it'd never happen. If i would look at the game through prism of the past I'd say it's game that puts MMOTPS genre into the next gen and has a lot of potential that yet has to be revealed... but it was 2 or even 3 years ago. As for today? Don't bother to try this game, servers are running poorly, gameplay mechanics are broken, community is awful and good players have difficulties to get opposed mmission due to matchmaking system yet even with those issues this game has moments when it really is fun. Beside of all these issues this game also has the biggest rage startling factor that i've ever seen in any game before as it's not just about your skill but how good are you at dealing with factors that you don't have control about.
1768	1	a	Screwin around is awesome
9636	1	a	
9666	1	a	i lost over a year of my life to this game
8451	0	a	APB, Back in The Days Of. RealTime, They Had Some Problems With This Game Of Course, But, They Eventually Caught Up With Them Faster Then Most Companies Would, It Was Pretty Much A Dream Game You Just Got Hooked To In A Flash After Testing, After Getting The Ropes Untangled. Then They Died Out And Others Toke Over The Fantastic Game.  ... ThatÂ´s Were All Kinds Of Hell Broke Losse For ME At Least.  RealTime, Never Caught Up To ALL Of The Problems It Had, But, Who Cared Back Then When You Actually Had A Super Fun Game?!  This Was A, Great Game Once, And Will Sadly Never Be Again, As ItÂ´s Riddled With;  * Bugs. * Glitches. * Screwed Up Mission System. * Grindy Then EVER. * Screwed Up, Improvised, Match-Making-Atempt-of-A-System. * Login Errors. * Random Game-System Errors, Never Seen So MANY Different Error Codes Before.  And Feels UnFinished, WhatÂ´s Worrse IS The Use Of PunkBuster, Wich is An Early Warning Flag For These Types Of Games.  However. If You Want To Experiance A Fun, And Totally Epic Game IÂ´m Sad To Say: ' YOU WILL FIND IT!  And Then Crushed When You Realise, YouÂ´r Peared Up Against Someone With 1000+ Hours Of Game Play, And HE CHEATS, Abuses Bugs/Glitches.  When You First Join Up With A Crew (Clan), Rebels Or Enforcers, You Will Get To Learn By Your Mates, HOW YOU ABUSE THOSE BUGS/GLITCHES, This Is A Very Common Practise.  Others, Kick Crew Members Who Are Caught Using Those Underhanded Tactics, At Least There Is Some Sort Of Silver Lining?.......  I Do Not Recommend This Game Anymore For What Ever Reason, It Had ItÂ´s Prime Days,Now They Are Simply Gone. IÂ´d Say Take Care APB &amp; Rest In Peace.... ~ Cries *
3391	1	a	I played in the Original BETA with RealTime Worlds. This version KICKS MORE ASSSS!!! Play it. Come onto Server: Patriots EU2
4613	0	a	&gt;account randomly blocked &gt;asks support why i got blocked and if i can get unblocked &gt;''your account is blocked permanently and will not be unblocked, further tickets will be ignored.'' &gt;thats all she wrote  &gt;?????  barf
542	1	a	This game is pretty nice, most items in Armas ( ingame market) its just clothes. But since clothes not give you any stats, its nothing. Weapons are mostly reskins. Company working slowly, so updates here kind of rare. But still this game worth to try.    Only 1 advice, don't play alone! Soloing in this game is unreal. Try to stay in your newbie districts (Green/Bronze) as long as you can ;)   Don't forget to read steam/forums guides.  gh hf
8066	0	a	there needs to be more added to the streets because they look so empty and i dont think it would be too hard to add stuff as to fill the streets. i think that they should bring out a update to do with the graphics needing to be re-done.. come on its comeing to 2016 there are alote of games that have better graphics and that are free as well.
2346	1	a	That game.... Developer claims its 'Free to play' , but its a pay to win... but its fun when you play agains 'normal' players ^_^
9119	1	a	Fallen Earth is an MMORPG game with the Post-Apocaliptic theme. You can either play in first person , either in third person ... But in first person you can only fight. Its OK for my taste. Its free . Its good for MMORPG lovers . I recommend it.
3755	0	a	After playing this game for about 3-4 years (and even giving a presentation about it for my highschool english final, kill me inside) I finally got the guts to quit playing it.  This game can be classified as GTA's artistic (no, not autistic) cousin who died off early due to a birth defect but was resurrected by the power of money and a dream that is constantly being battered down by a poor community and a money-hungry company.  I'm not berating this game. The only problems I have with the game is its toxic community (aside from some hand-picked few), the fact you have to pay for everything, and the graphics get worse each year. I still do come back to it to make some friend's custom symbols for when they ask. This game was great for what it was at the time. A F2P multiplayer Grand Theft Auto for the PC in which you can customize just about everything you ever wanted. But for the community and the company that hosts the game? I'd be taping a huge DO NOT CROSS banner on it if you're looking for a game to main. Play this game only if you have a bunch of friends to join in to kill time.  The game is great for what it delivers as a 2008 (or around that?) game. - You can lean around corners and you're allowed a wide-range of weaponry consisting of but not limited to: On-Impact Grenades, Light-weight Snipers, Rocket Launchers, IRL Paid-For Legendary Pistols that do better than any of the F2P rifles in the game (I'm looking at you Nano &lt;3), half a brick, and even snowballs. - The Vehicle system is great allowing you to buy a bunch of epic looking cars that (for real life money) you can modify just like Need For Speed Underground with the body kits, car seats, dump valves, radio waves, and monkeys. - You can run around two different pretty big cityscapes ranging at 1k+ meters and traverse it the way you want by either running around or driving cars (or surfing on em). - It contains one of the best character and car customization systems out there, allowing you to make symbols by the use of manipulating random shapes/vectors and placing them on a vast amount of character clothing and vehicles. - You're also able to change the music people hear when you kill them, music that gets played out your car, and music that you can play in a portable stereo system. (Yes I know, its as epic as it seems) - And you can even chill in the game's social area where you can edit your car, clothes, face, and just hangout with other bros and bro-dettes.  All-in-all if you want a game in which to customize stuff with, this is your game. However you practically have to pay to get everything, otherwise have fun spending thousands of hours trying to unlock everything. Also don't play this game if you get mad really easily, that's my final word on this.
9856	1	a	The map is huge. Biggest map ive ever seen. Play it for good looks
1072	1	a	Realy good game to spend your time and money on.   Pay2Win..
7231	0	a	I have not play the game yet even though that it says I played 1.3 hours, the game just wouldn't start, it ran even with my computer shut down. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE! This will change when the developers fix what ever problems this game has. I got interested by watching YouTuber Rapid99 play this.
8462	0	a	The game is good, but it is buy to win so â¥â¥â¥â¥ it...
8388	0	a	APB RELOADED Horrible Community. Useless Game Designers(since beta network issues) nothing more. NO. Uninstall. Shut Down Get rid Of.
868	1	a	Entered the game bought g1c got the euryale  banned 11/10 whould defentily buy again
10184	0	a	I did not enjoy this game one bit, the controls are really irritating and very hard to use. It gives very little information on how to even play. I do NOT recmend this game to anyone.
3518	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
2435	1	a	The best crime warfare !!! Weapons and outfits are no limits. Open-world and cool online missions can replace GTA V! { Just only my opinion. Sorry if you're GTA fan }
92	1	a	Do you want to play a game where you can steal cars...drive them and destroy them because you always wanted to do it? Or do you want to shoot the sh*t out of your enemy and enjoy the physics of the dead body flying from that building you shot him before? Or do you just want to play GTA online? This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ awesome game does include every aspect mentioned! Play as a crime or an enforcer, it is your choice.
9804	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
5258	0	a	First things first, this game gave me high blood pressure         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Best of Frankie&nbsp;
1690	1	a	WOOT WOOT â¥â¥â¥â¥ GTA GO THIS jk Still really good 
5616	0	a	I think I played this for a long time... Its Pay 2 win with over powerd weapons and car upgrades only avable for payed accses members. If you have a big wallet and time I can recomend this game, But If you have time and no wallet I can tell you that you will have a good time dying all the time.

2239	1	a	It's very cool game and very annoying one..
10105	1	a	this is a good action and aventure game for people who like killing stealing and dieing
5409	0	a	Game is RUINED. The new company with zero management skills took EVERYTHING away from older players (mainly the game itself) and made it easier and more appealing to ignorant and obnoxious 13 year old callofdutyâ¥â¥â¥â¥, animeâ¥â¥â¥â¥, bronyâ¥â¥â¥â¥, and potheads who use their mommy's credit card to buy a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing $10 GUN in a game so they can grief the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of everyone else that use to enjoy it and other than that they have nothing else better to do than hump eachother's female avatars while they listen to gay japanese music, who have now OVERUN the game. Any comments or complaints of their eratic behaviors are met with fierce opposition from almost the ENTIRE community. This is coming from a day one beta player with 100+ hours and if you don't believe me, DON'T try it for yourself.
742	1	a	So far, still extremely fun as hell. A lot of ways you can show off your creativity, and even though the missions are repeative, if you have a good team they can prove to be a bunch of fun.  10/10
8841	0	a	What got me to try it was its intricate customization system but, sadly, it wasn't fully accessible without having a Premium account. Along with my other disappointments is that the game is Pay-to-Win, meaning that new players can just buy off stronger items (with real-world cash) than to work hard for them. I don't recommend this unless you have a stack of money to burn.
7575	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
5951	0	a	you will be constantly fixing it while the reward isnt to great (gta clone) as it disintagrates the entire computer
2831	1	a	Hilarious
923	1	a	Even though this game is Pay-To-Win which i don't normally play, it's the only Pay-To-Win game i enjoy  Pro's  - You can customize pretty much everything - Graphics are nice - Loads of things to do like missions/pvp/social/chill   Con's  - PvP Feels Unbalanced - Pay-To-Win - Toxic Players join your missions.  Overall Rating: 8.5/10
10633	1	a	Amazing game, many say its dead but not yet. I recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet.
5012	0	a	Hackers, cheaters everywhere, i never play it because it sucks, buy Saints Row and play with COOP for better experience.  Or apply for Triad Wars Beta , bette.r.
5982	0	a	This game needs controller support, just saying....
8420	0	a	The game is good, but it is buy to win so â¥â¥â¥â¥ it...
6894	0	a	It is a huge pay to win game and it is boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you dont add moeny. 0/10 hate alot...
7128	0	a	I don't really like this game. It isn't what i thought i was going to be. You need to Pay to Win in this game. Can't really understand how to drive a car in this game. Because, when i press 'D', the wheel will turn 1 second after i presses 'D'
6369	0	a	PayPB: Reloaded  it gave me AUTEESM
3979	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Pay to win game. Waste of time.
4158	0	a	tiggs ruined the game
4780	0	a	Played it a few years ago outside steam. This is a sad, disappointing joke of a game. Great idea, but completely unbalanced, terribly running, full of P2W. New players have nothing to say here, they are going to get torn to shreds by grenades and high level, out of balance P2W guns literally during their first mission. Cars behave awful, game looks mediocre, gun handling seems â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Complete waste of time, unless you want to have a go with custimising aspect of the game, which is amazing. But the grind to get money WILL be very repetitive/painful.
6492	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
523	1	a	Play from Australia and it is unbelievably delay for driving a car. It is like max out the driving difficulty. :P But what make this game so good is a extreme customisations that I never ever see before.
8516	0	a	Can't even play the game until I leave a Like on their facebook page?! Are you kidding me? Firstly how am I supposed to know if I like your game unless you let me play it first and secondly are you so insecure about it that you have to beg for likes before you let people see it? Uninstalled, pathetic.
10321	1	a	this game its awesome so cool know i have 20 friends thinks to this game who ever make this game its the best
416	1	a	the game is great but when i open it , it closes it self.
8921	1	a	An okay game overall, but I made some righteous friends on here so 8/10 for that
6844	0	a	Not really good, the game just throws you in with no explanation of what to do. Everyone is running around with p2w weapons which can one shot you, your start weapons are absolute useless shot my whole magazine in guy and he didnt even flinch.Also the grenade spam is preposterous everytime you come near a objective you are greeted by thousands of grenades... Loading times are waaay too long which is strange considering that the graphic arent that great. All in all I didnt had a good time also the community are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
9780	0	a	Horrible game. Srsly. Why would you play something like this!? _:
8552	0	a	Worst third person shooter I've ever played. Hackers everywhere, never miss a shot and can see you coming on radar you don't have. Pointless to play even with money.
722	1	a	no one cares just play the game.
7010	0	a	Solid concept, bad execution. Why? Online multiplayer doesn't work. &gt;.&gt;
394	1	a	its good to me :3
1191	1	a	Pros 1. Love the Customization even for a Free Account (9.9/10) = Not cause I'm free (There is a Limit (3), The Video is showing you a Premium Account(50)), but cause I thought clothing was more modular (And trust it is already pretty modular, reminds me of NFS Carbon and the Customization is so good it can be a game on its own)    Example of What I thought Clothing Customization would be = Shirt: Collars/Cuff Type, Collar/Sleeve Length and Collar Form; a Deep V-Neck with Fur Collar, Tight Long Sleeves (Upto Wrist) and Puffy Rounded Fur Cuffs --vs-- Tight Open Turtleneck (Under the Jaw) with Button/Latch Collar (Similar to Motorcycle Bike Rider Jacket) and Sleeveless/Shoulder Length with Ripped Cuff (Similar to Ryu from Street Fighter) (For Cuff Types Google 302444931199841460 ) = Shoe's Length, sole or toe/heel type: High Feel Sneakers vs Clown Boots (Kingdom Hearts), Spiked Toes/heel vs Open Toes/heel (Naruto) = Gloves Length (Half of Palm, Wrist, Elbow, Shoulder), Finger/Knuckless (Which Finger(s)), Palm/Back hand less (Size, Shape), Wrist/Finger Trim/Cuff (Ribbed, Zipped, etc) = Holding style as well (There isn't Dual), but Shoot the weapon the way you want     2. Love the Controls as I use keyboard (8/10, but need some buttons to overlap specific controls like Turning the Camera On Foot, but not while Driving)  3. Love the GTA Feel (9/10, Commandeer or Hijack Vehicles, but sadly only 2 weapons are allow to be equipped at once and there isn't dual Wielding)  Cons 3. The thing I like the least is the Tutorial (5/10) as I will not gain money and there are no NPCs. I'm stuck trying to find the Evidence Vault -some places are hard to find- need indication of which door is usable and step by step of where to go ( Highlight the Area/Path or Place it somewhere easy to access)  4. Jumping and Climbing is in, but its predetermined (So those walls you can almost make it over, you can't), and there are so many doors to go through
614	1	a	this game is awesome! you can be cops or crims you can get money from missons and buy cars and clothes and guns! and you can do missons with friends and buy thing for your car and get a name and edit your people!
740	1	a	Go ahead and play this game.  You will soon find out why players that only spend 40 hours on the game like it and why the players that have logged over 800 hours hate it.      Note: This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome; It has so much potential- It just has the world's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest Dev's I have ever seen.
4233	0	a	It runs in the background..? I've played for 4 minutes and I've logged 18 hrs.
5192	0	a	I have played APB for a short time, when I first started playing I got gold my first day, I was having fun, but as soon as you hit high ranked servers, you're dead, the game is no longer fun because you can't kill cheaters, or people who are just too good at the game and should stop playing it.   APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change. Change what the community wants you to change.  Will NOT play again. 3/10
9299	0	a	this game kinda just showed up in my libraray
1070	1	a	A truly unique gaming experience, almost endless character and gear customization, fast-paced FPS action, and the timelessness of cops vs robbers.
2179	1	a	Not The Best Game I've Ever Played, But It Can Still Improve To Be Better :)
6554	0	a	Don't play this game unless you want to create a bond with it to only play this game and no others. This game is EXTREMELY unabalanced. No matter what weapon you pick the 'pay to win' weapons will ALWAYS outclass you. SMG's are unbalanced as they can shoot from long ranges and still maintain accuracy, and those are SECONDARY weapons. Essentially just pay for a SMG and a Rocket Launcher and then nothing can stop you. The only fun part of this is the music making. I wouldn't call this game pay to win because that would give it some decency. This game will make you it's b**** until you give it money.
7574	0	a	pay2win game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
9765	0	a	i thought this game might be good. Played it for 10 minutes and wanted to kill myself.
1254	1	a	best game to play,iam addicted
380	1	a	I Love Playing this game but the sad part is i dont own any credit cards and i want a weapon that i can have permantly have and not for rent because i hate renting things :P
9342	0	a	this game was fun be for the dev made it hard too play picking and take of caer of faction they like it get old after a long of time playing then the dev allow bullying harassment peoepl you did notuhing too get mad then start following you where every you go and kill you so yea i wont ever play this sorry game ever agning be thing the dev need too do is trun off the who's in the local area beacues pvp mean player vs player then mean there sholud not be any thing too give off where they are on the map or what part there in
7444	0	a	I have not yet got to play this game , However it states that i have played for 89 mins. untrue I can not even get into it and i have loged in iI have created and regiestered but have yet to play the damed game what the hell is it. I am taking every thing out of my laptop now and forgetting I even tried this god awlful game bye bye
6845	0	a	Strike three! The game won't let me even play it.   Okay people make a game that you simply INSTALL and then it PLAYS with no problems.   SO many other game makers do that.    Make a character, choose a name, choose a zone. Then NOTHING. The NEXT button never lights up.   The other times the stupid game said I had another account it was under. Did I sign in with another accout? No.   Looks like it could be cool but I don't have all eon to try and get onto this game. Now how do I delete this and forget it for good.
6537	0	a	IT IS A TERRIBLE GAME DO NOT EVER PLAY IT!
9063	1	a	This game is by far one of the more enjoyable post apocalyptic mmorpg's combat is fun and interesting, the stat system is simple yet complex as you can choose what you want to be able to do in the game making it a unique experience for each indivual player. All in all a fun game to play either alone but more fun if you can get a group together making encounter's much easier.
4329	0	a	APB Reloaded is quite the interesting game. It's a fast paced 3rd person shooter MMO in a somewhat open world. I've enjoyed this game since 2013 (ah, the good old days.) The game itself is very buggy and can make no sense at all when it comes to combat sometimes. But if you actually get the hang of how the gun mechanics work then you should be set. Ad the driving, oh man the driving. these cars are hard as hell to drive. either too slow, too fast, car gets blown up too easy, can't blow up an enemy car cause it's too armored. This game requires a lot of skill and a buttload of learning. I say try it out and try to get past rank 60 and you might get addicted. And that stuff about being pay2win is all nonsense. the joker CR 5 has the same exact stats as an ntech. The difference is that you buy the joker CR 5 with real money. And if you actually pay for some of the packs, they come with awesome cars, clothes, and weapons. Every gun that is on the armas market (the place you go to spend real money) has different variant at the joker store (ingame store to buy guns with ingame currency). And speaking of gear, the customization is endless. Do you want to look like a soldier? A maid? A racer? Someone fro myour favorite franchise of games? you can do it all. I would recommend buying premium with this game. You get more contact standing, more money, and discounts on pretty much everything in the armas marketplace. You also get waaaaay more room to customize. It goes from a nonpremium member only having room to use 25 shapes to a symbol, to a premium member being able to use 100 shapes. I love this game and it has a special little home for me and a lot of the veterans on this game. Also, this was originally made by the people that made crackdown, so you'll notice some similarities.  TL;DR  Pros- no limit to creativity, be who you want there are quite a bit of nice people in the community, they just don't talk addicting super fun with friends cool guns cool cars  cons- The playerbase is usually extremely salty and mean they push you to buy stuff a lot it is very hard for a beginner to enjoy because it's an odd game mechanics can break and ruin everything too many bugs (can't do a mission because the mission just breaks for no reason) very, very, veeeery grindy game  As much as I love it. I only love this game because I've been playing it over the years and it is unique. Other than that it's a meh game.
4612	0	a	Falsely banned over 3 years ago. Terrible customer service as you can't even email them to contest the ban. Didn't respond to my BBB inquiry.   Had the nerve to tell me that I was justly banned but the need my money now so they are unbanning me. They can shove this game where the sun doesn't shine.
1498	1	a	This is a very great game, i love this game! Its the best game i have seen some its free&lt;3
1339	1	a	Great game , epic i can say... it doesn't even feel like a matchmaking game because it's map is so huge that you forget about that part.  Pros : You can create your own designs and apply them on about anything that you own (yea car / clothes / character / weapons , even post graifty on buildings with your own design/picture). Fun to play as hell , at least , at first. Cons: Lag , lag , lag , lag , then something amazing happens ( yea no more lag) and then again , lag lag lag lag.... The low ammount of hackers is still annoying. Pay to win. Even a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ one can produce a killing spree with a bought weapon , so you may have an idea on how overpowered are the premium weapons. Also , premium players get x3 more rewards than a normal player does. So meh , if P2W isn't a problem for you , then you may enjoy this alot! It is pretty hard to at begining at least. And the game is free so meh , i guess i should not complain about negative parts , to much.
8551	0	a	So I wrote that section at the bottom way back in 2014, recommending the game. I've since changed my opinion.  Honestly, this game does have great potential, but it's wasted by empty promises for better updates and non-stop premium shop content releases.  A lot of weapons are simply not viable thanks to a small meta selection that out-performs the rest, and the developers aren't looking to balance things out any time soon.  Terrible match-making paired with terrible mission objective locations means you'll eaver be the team that stomps, or the team getting stomped. There's no close matches anymore, it's always a hard win or a hard loss.  Developers have repeatedly promised updates that will fix things, such as an engine update for optimisation, chat moderation systems and weapon balancing, and each time a deadline has been given, it's come to pass with nothing but a few new premium items added to the market.  If you want to try this game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, it's free after all. Just don't invest your money into it, at this point the game deserves to die.  __________________  It's undeniable that this game has a great, unique concept and is literally brimming with potential. Endless customization and plenty of things to do let you truly shape your own life in this non-linear game.   Hours, days and even weeks can be spent on this game without losing interest and entertainment.   Sadly its full potential is yet to be met by the developers who bought out this game, but recently hope has been lit as they detail changes they're working on.   I wholeheartedly recommended this game to everyone, despite it's flaws. The entertainment this game delivers is truly noteworthy for a free to play game.
4906	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
8262	0	a	Spent half an hour in the character customization menu making sure I have the best looking jugs and nostrils in the game, entered a District, tried to do the tutorial, got gunned down by another player. Re-spawned. Tried to make sense of the map. Got gunned down. Re-spawned. Tried to do a tutorial, was prompted to press K. Pressed K, received a mission. Got called a noob and was told to go fornicate off and die. Got gunned down.  Uninstalled the game.
10494	1	a	Not a bad MMO for its age, its lowish graphics make it easily runnable on even the worst of potatoes. along with the crafting system being rather well done in my own opinion.
3117	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
8200	0	a	its a great game but its frickin pay to win every team i go against im sniped by a gold weapon which has perfect stats so either nerf these weapons or make them rewards because im sick of it. DONT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY  
4523	0	a	I don't know why this is in my steam library, but I don't approve.
941	1	a	Like it to death
978	1	a	Take me down, to the San Paro city, where the noobz are green and teh hacks are pretty.
913	1	a	The highs are really high, the lows are really frequent.  Though not as much lately!  I've been playing APB on and off since RTW beta and it honestly does just keep getting tighter and better all the time. I can't for the life of me persuade anyone to return to give it another chance, though.  The customisation options alone mark this out as something special, but managing to have a roughly working game where 100 players can drive around in their custom vehicles in their custom outfits playing their customised theme tunes having non-instanced PvP missions against each other on a huge map is even more of an achievement.  It's not GTA and it doesn't have fancy euphoria physics or anything, but when it's good none of that matters.
10437	0	a	it definetly isnt a fallout game nor dayz but it's fun the pvp isnt really 'good' as you would say the weapon's literaly are nerfed alot since the last time i played and i didnt alpy it alot but i mean yeah it's a open wor;d apocalypse game but the pvp isnt worth downloading this for.
4111	0	a	This Game Blows, the music sucks, you can't even rob an armoured armed Truck. Waste of my time this and I'm To Sexy For This Game :D
9450	0	a	Godawful game, its a laggy mess with horrible graphics. Just Don't get it. Its a waste of time.
9683	0	a	pretty boring game. gave it a chance... uninstalled within a half an hour.
8959	1	a	Fallen Earth Pros:  -Amazing environment and immersion -Wonderful PvP gameplay -A rediculously good crafting system -A large ready-to-explore map to quench your need for adventure -55 levels with new gear no matter what you're at -Conveniantly placed merchants and fairly easy-to-master Fast Travel system for teleporting all over the map at low cost Auction prices that players post are generally fair*  Fallen Earth Cons: -The majority of the staff team needs work or improvement as far as moderation and fairness goes (this is prone to change whenever they may so improve) -The community is easy to get sucked into, and not in a good way, people tend to troll endlessly if you get them going, and they can go on for hours and never shut up due to mass amounts of self-pride and ignorance -Everyone types with their face -The Auction can sometimes become inflated but over-all it's fair*  Do I reccomend it? Yes! This game is unlike any other, and you can't say Fallout beats it because last I checked Fallout didn't have the balls to be an MMO! Let alone FREE TO PLAY YOUR WAY!
4643	0	a	Don't mind the Steam played time. I played it when RTW owned it, and I've got 188 hours in the G1 version.  Let me break this down for you.  The game advertises customizing your guns to fit your playstyle. Unfortunately, to do that, you will need to grind. A lot. First you have to grind contacts to unlock that gun, then you have to grind kills to get upgrades for that gun (that may not even be the upgrade type you want).  And the grinding will NOT be fun. The playerbase is all but gone, which means matchmaking (not that it was EVER good) is horrible. Expect to be stomped on constantly by the folks who have spent plenty of cash for the much more effective ARMAS weapons. Also expect to be matched up against gold players as a bronze or silver a lot. They hang out in the bronze districts because there's nobody to be found in silver or gold.  So if you like being forced to open the ARMAS store every time you open the game (unless you turn off Steam in-game), having UPGRADE NOW flash at you every time you finish a mission, and having to get your â¥â¥â¥ stomped on for hours upon hours because there's literally nobody else to play against, this game is for you.  If you don't like lessons in masochism, do not play this game. I tried. I really tried to enjoy the game, but I just couldn't... and I fear you might not either.  Unless you drop a couple hundred dollars and start mowing people down. Then you might like it.  EDIT: Lest I forget there IS a way to get the cash shop guns by grinding tons of in-game cash and daily limited Joker tickets. So if you're a masochist, this game is for you.
10750	1	a	there has to be a certain...allure to being able to 'ski' around a combat area shooting TNT frisbees at each other.   Gameplay wise the game is rock solid. It doesn't try to be something it's not which is a nice relief.   Great game 9/10
6351	0	a	This game is a piece of crap, when about to start the game, it doesn't pop up. I had spented 2 f*cking hours to wait for the game to download.  2\10 -IGN
6918	0	a	It's GTA + aimbots
3034	1	a	Awesome game. Very open worlded and customizable. Definitley get it.
1310	1	a	choo choo
8369	0	a	Me and my friend tried playing it , well wasn't very fun . P2W
3529	1	a	Cool game for going all out against hordes of cops/criminals. Also, very good customization options, I recommend. 
10364	0	a	bad game, wierd controls and bad graphics
5682	0	a	Matchmaking is very frustrating. (Two Silvers v. Two golds) Weapons feel unbalanced, and paying members are definitely the winners in this (Pay-to-win) Freemium game.
8006	0	a	Download APB Reloaded they said.  It will be fun they said.
657	1	a	If you want a free GTA Online then this is as close as you're gonna get! It is a really fun game and you may aswell try it because it is free! 9/10
4197	0	a	just got it finished downloading then needed to update and takes forever and it stops and dosent save my download%. 
9146	1	a	It's a good game.
17	1	a	  Definitely one of a kind.    Don't be fooled with my hours played here in Steam, I actually have one character that has over 1,800 hours played. And did I mention that is just for one character? Not just that, but I've been playing this game since its Open Beta Phase during 2011, and that is even before it was released here in Steam.     1. Background   - The game was first released on June 2010 under the name 'APB: All Points Bulletin', where in the game design was led by David Jones, who created the original Grand Theft Auto. During this time, the game was subscription based. But on November 2010, the developer has announced that the game will be shut down due to lack of development process, management focus, and the desire to make the game better. But on March 2011, the game was revived and sent to Closed Beta where 5,000 players were invited. Then it has been released on May 2011 to Open Beta.    2. Graphics   - The game is still using an old engine, therefore in its current state even if you can run Grand Theft Auto V on the highest settings, you're still going to face some stutters here. But the developers have announced a roadmap for this year, and it includes an engine upgrade.     3. Content   - Most of the contents are recycled, weapons re-skins are common, and some are just brought back to life from the old development. The team currently doesn't have anyone who can animate as well.    4. Gameplay   - I'll be honest, it may look like a Pay2Win game for those who are new to the game because of the weapons that can be bought from the in-game cash shop called Armas Marketplace. Other than that, the game also has a very steep learning curve. Yes, it is pretty easy to play the game but it's actually hard to be good at it. Most of the time you'll be thinking your oppositions are using aimbots or triggerbots. But if you give it time, learn the different uses of each weapons, techniques on how to take advantages of the situation, learn the different tactics to win, and etc., you will be more than rewarded. Because let me tell you, stock weapons can beat the hell out of this paid weapons.    5. Customization   - Given the old engine, some parts of the customization may hinder you from what you're trying to achieve. BUT! Never have I encountered a game like this, you can literally create any designs you have in mind. You have a shirt in your closet that you want your character to wear? No problem, you can! But the only catch here is... You have to be good at it. This is one of the reasons why I'm still playing this game, it's because I can be who I want my character to be.    If ever you're interested in checking out some of the clothes/outfits/vehicles I made you may check them out  here.       6. Micro-transactions   - The only lifesaver this game has. The cash shop is pretty much expensive, why? You want a cool looking clothing pack that only consists of about 5 items, sure, just pay them 10$ for that. It even offers weapons that can be overpowered to those who are new.   Update: They have released packs that includes tons of new items bundled into one. The pack actually costs 40$, but if we're going to analyze the content, it's worth more than what they're asking.    7. Conclusion   - Even with my huge hours of playing this game, I also had some breaks. There are times that you just want to stop and get over it. But sooner or later, you'll find yourself searching for something to repalce this game. If you first thought that this is just another Grand Theft Auto clone, then you're wrong. I admit, at first that was also my first impression. Time goes by, I realized it is nowhere near it, it's a different breed of game.
1894	1	a	greatest free to play forerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
6666	0	a	need alot of revison and alot of balnce 
1921	1	a	Amazing game!! A must play for pc gamers.
2145	1	a	Good Game but as soon as you reach Gold there is many people with Hacks - Triggerbots etc. Kind of sad, very low hack protection and a lot of very low Rank people without anything but are gold, mhmm suspicious.. Apparently it should get better soon
9950	1	a	Fun when u know how to do it .. :))))
8366	0	a	This a great game, but the community sucks... And the Support don't care about you just care about your pocket if you have money they will accept it, but if you need help they will just ignore you or say that they can't do nothing for you. So that's why I don't like this game, but I'm already addicted, I'm getting cancer and bla bla... So for your life if you want to be happy and get a family one day don't play this game.
3023	1	a	Best game ever . GTA+Saints row + multiplayer = AWESOME!
6469	0	a	My steam profile keeps saying i'm in game APB reloaded but i'm not so lets get to the point THE GAME IS RUBBISH CRAP
2304	1	a	Meh, got it to play with a mate, plus its free so cant complain.
2017	1	a	This game is so bad its good
9244	1	a	relly like this game i recon you should try it cos moet likely u will like it
931	1	a	  plz fix game freezing ;-;
4620	0	a	Was a really bad game, I didn't like it, do not even try it.
5518	0	a	Bugs, trolls, unbalanced combat and a general pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5224	0	a	i have played this game for nearly 1000 hours. not on steam but when it was just by itself. i can say without a doubt in my 1000 hours, this game is nothing but hunger for money.  Dont bother playing. Pros - Variety of guns Variety of customisation of vehicles and character Fun in groups  Cons - Horrible customer service by APB Money hungry game No body cares about your opinion Hackers left and right Have your account hacked every few months and for APB customer service not to do anything about it. 
9813	0	a	well... a bit hard to play, specially because of the lame movement and combat system... i know it's old and all, and it has a nice story to... but i had to mess up a lot on the oficial page, game1 page... then, after 1 hour downloading, i had to wait another one installing it. if you like these kind of games, fallout can be found free and it's obviously better.
9924	1	a	If you can't wait for a Fallout MMORPG, then here's the closest thing. You'll have to live without V.A.T.S., but since I don't see how that would work in multiplayer without making it turn-based anyway, this will more than satisfy your needs for a giant post-apocalyptic world to explore and survive in. Plus crafting i s awesome. Oh and ENDLESS ways to personalize your character&lt;3
1001	1	a	Its ok
408	1	a	it is cool
6668	0	a	a nice game, really indepth char customization. sadly it gets boring really quick. as it is just -&gt;get money-&gt;launder-&gt;buy some of the limited items of ingame currency -&gt; do again  you also get spammed in the face every 10 minutes with BUY PREMIUM GET THIS AND THAT  Physics are also just complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. also is car steering  but with some friends on skype you can defenitely have some fun in here.
6959	0	a	pay to win trash
9143	0	a	Fallen Earth is the story of a really awesome idea getting destroyed by poor presentation, horrible gameplay, and just making a great example an how not to make a MMORPG. The story is sort of simple, you are a clone and stuff happened and then other stuff happened and now you are in the open (after a 20 min tutorial). I'm being for real I didn't know what was going on the entire time. The dialouge is horrendous which becomes a problem since thats how you get both important information and quests. Even though it's free it's not worth your time.
6626	0	a	The idea was good, but the world feels to small, the way people misuse the system, even without hacking/cheating, just makes the game bad.
9239	0	a	WHOOO, EVERY FUN THING IN A GAME: Slow annoying movement, Crappy Ai's, Glitches, Crappy jump, Crappy mission system(its glitchy), Press Y to interact? Most games is press E, Crappy dailog box(it glitches...), Crappy skills.  Well, if ou like that crap ^^^ then this game, still isnt for you... its really that bad, don't play this game.
336	1	a	I Didn't Choose The Thug Life, The Thug Life Chose Me.
9718	0	a	Way too hard to understand, full of 100's of hard to follow tutorial, and unclear instructions. During my 0.7 hours i play, i achieved 3 deaths, a couple of kills(NPC's) and litreally nothing else. I tried extremely hard to find a storyline, or quest but could only find one's i needed higher levels for. 3/10
479	1	a	sorry about the scar.
6399	0	a	.
6461	0	a	It's an addicting game, but lacks many things that would make it immensely enjoyable, headshots, visual range greater than 325 feet, heavy weapons doing more damage at closer ranges, destructible environments, melee abilities, FLAMETHROWERS, WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE FLAMETHROWERS??? Also, for such a large variety of weapons and gears, it seems to be very limited on options for vehicles, most upgraded vehicles are one of about a dozen set base cars with multiple modifications that do for the most part, NOTHING.
4841	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
247	1	a	I recommend it, no dirty stuff like GTA V. It's fun to play when your bored. Make new friends in it and play together. Invite your Steam Friends to play too!
4594	0	a	Pay To Win {PTW} .. i played this game when it was in beta and loved it in the begining when you have 'no packs ' to buy or as we say not PAY TO WIN ... but now if you played lets say 1000 hr and you did not spend any money in the game ... you will have less â¥â¥â¥â¥ and worst luck than a guy played this game for 10hr who payed 500$ in the game already .... yes .. if you have money you have skilles and if not you suck and this is the reality of this game .
6597	0	a	wow took hour 2 download and said i have not anoth room when my laptop is empty just steam and apb
5851	0	a	Doesn't work/10  I guess i should say more. well you can't smoke weed, that's not very open. oh and i love pay to win, why did i give this a thumbs down again? well to sum it up, this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥in' mlg
8212	0	a	Spent the last 3 hours tring too install its 'Game Files' and it can't even run the application.. I recieved a Steam Error when it tried to run.. Don't download, the game makes your download a lot of other bloatware which the game itself doesn't need.
7233	0	a	It's been trying to launch for 40 minutes now and I'm still looking at my desktop background
43	1	a	This is probably my favorite game of all time. I love this game for many reasons. One reason being that it has an EXTREMELY wide array of customization features. You can customize pretty much everything from weapons to clothes to cars to custom themes to play whenever you kill someone! Another reason this game is so amazing is because of the gameplay. It never gets boring or bland (especially when playing with friends!) It is also so much fun to pop out and shoot someone down that is about to score the last winning point to cause you to lose the mission. The game has awesome and hilarious physics that will cause your car to literally FLY in the air whenever you hit a ramp! The game is overall very smooth, extremely fun, and very versatile and different. I like to think of it as if GTA and a Cops and Robbers style game had a baby. This game is fantastic.
9214	1	a	I like he ''Mad Max'' feeling of this game, it's a great idea overall. But it would've been great if the developers tried to interact with their fellow fans.
5783	0	a	'Oh man this game looks awso-' Got headshoted in the head by a sniper. *respawns* 'Alright! let's g-' gets a pellets from a shotgun in the back. *respawns* 'Just give me a mome-' gets blown up by a rocket launcher. *respawns* 'What the fu-' Gets ran over. *respawns*  'Ok â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gam-' Gets banned. Morale of the story: Just give up. Besides music and customizations, this game doesn't hold anything intersting. And though it seems like I don't know anything about this game in my 16 hours of gameplay, I have another 200+ gameplay hours from an older account that I played it back in 2013, and trust me, this game almost hasn't changed a bit since.
6480	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
7621	0	a	I'm playing on a 2500 dollar game rig that was built within the last 6 months. With my setup this game plays for â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can barely get 20 fps during combat. Customisation is amasing, though. I hear it's p2w, but I can't confirm as I can't really play it.
1572	1	a	I CANT GET THE LAUNCHER TO UPDATE IT WORKED FINE YESTERDAY NOW ITS MESSED UP

9375	0	a	Not a bad game but also not the best game. My only concern about this game is the controls are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ it makes the game almost unplayable. Another thing is that u have the press either 'Y' or the scroll wheel to toggle the ability to look around and thats kind of stupid. Like i said, not a bad game but also not a good game. If you want this game, by all means get it but i dont recommend it.
2119	1	a	Pay to win from when I played it, but I think it got better, and it was always fun....third person kind of makes angle camping kind of common, but I always recommend free games.
10786	1	a	This is by far the best game I have ever played.
7081	0	a	Want to try an MMO that's Free to Play!? This game has some of the best customization out of any game I've ever played. You can customize your character's clothing, appearance, tattoos, and even your car. It's FREE, check it out today!!!  UPDATE (1/1/2016): If I were you, I wouldn't waste your time on APB: Reloaded since it has become a Pay to Win style game. The company that took this game over has changed it from the glory this game once was.   You'd be better off NOT wasting your time with this title.
9596	0	a	derivative and repetitive. You'll find nothing in this game that every other mmo doesn't have. It's crafting is pointlessly slow and the map is too big and the content too low. Leveling to 20 and entering a new map is tedious and punishing. Don't download it just because it's free. Guild Wars 2 is free now and infinitely better.
6088	0	a	Would be fun if balanced, but its not.  Pros: Its pretty almost like GTA, and you can drive a car YAY! And also pay money to look like, well a bunny, or something stupid like that. Thats it... Cons: Why a bunny? Because nearly every firefight ends with you being bunny hopped at close range. How many seats does the car have? WHY would that matter if you can simply ride on TOP of the car? Shooting at a car is fairly useless, tires dont blow out. Driver cant be killed unless they exit the car. You can then just bunny hop on them. The whole game is build around buying stuff on their annoying marketplace. Why give the player a choice of 5 FREE GUNS for 10 days, if they can simply go to the marketplace and try a BETTER gun for free for a day, theres more then 10 to choose from. The NPCs are useless. The only missions you do are random ones by selecting READY, that is not an RPG. Servers are unbalanced. Guns unbalanced. Half the time getting into your OWN car takes over 3 seconds. People shoot a grenade at your feet and arrest you, and you can do nothing. You play for 10 seconds, and then wait 30 seconds to respawn. There is no teamwork at all, just rushing the enemy 'beach of normandy style' till they die from being overwhelmed. Loading time is HORRIBLE, connecting to server takes forever, just to find out that there is only 3 people there and you need 4 to play. Weapons are kinda sad, lots of choices but are basiclly the same, you buy ammo manualy, cuz they gotta drain your in game money on something I guess. Thanks a lot. Sorry im tired of typing...
7604	0	a	Laggy gameplay, car physics broken, seemingly bad input lag, under average shooting mechanics. There are better free games out there than this.
6751	0	a	The typical pay-2-win game. The only game that stats in a weapon mean absolutely nothing. You get into the game and your first prize is to try out the premium membership for 1 day. I have no idea what it gives, neither what advantages I can gather from it. And then, there you go into a confusing game where everything is random. Your party is picked randomly, missions are picked randomly, your level is random. And the tutorial won't help you to understand this case.  The game claims to have a matchmaking on, but you will always randomly join noobs in your team and play against pros. The server itself is lagging awfully, it's hard to control cars or even his own character. The map is fine but not entirely used, some places are useless. Finally, people on the chat are psychotic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that cry if someone is better than them because they spent so much money that they wouldn't accept to be beaten anymore. Also, it's full of hackers.  I won't even try again.  
5698	0	a	the pay to win element is cancer
7116	0	a	Good game a realy good game. But this is more like log in simulator.   1/10
2820	1	a	All Points Bulletin, or APB for short.....what to say? It's a 50/50 with me,   This is a great free-roam game, and the ability to make your own character is good. all the different vehicles you have to choose from are great, and the fine details on everything is nice to see.  However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot. Just don't go in with high expectations or you will be disappointed
2398	1	a	i think game APB reloaded so good and I verry like game.
7568	0	a	This game requires that you downgrade your graphics drivers pretty heavily for the game to even launch at all. Sorry APB, but I'm not going back to 2011's geForce drivers just for you.
1828	1	a	play this game
8362	0	a	Best Horrible Game so Far ...
1993	1	a	it's kinda gta for free, but not as good
7949	0	a	no good if ur new. the gear is too bad so you cant compete with the ppl you have to fight. the game matches you up against experienced players with mad gear -- no XP to be had. uninstalled
9847	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
2650	1	a	its a awesome game
8115	0	a	i was sooooooo excited to get this game! and i tried everything to make it work but it wont even come on! 
5424	0	a	So I found this game maybe in 2011. I played it first as criminal, didnt like it, changed to cop. Crminals are easy money faction, because you can ram with stolen van on store, get the stuff, sell them and change money to clean ones. Cops are also very fun because you can 'chase' random ppl for nothing sirens on to â¥â¥â¥â¥ them off. (Ramming included) Now let's get to + and - parts  Pros +Character customization and car customization totally in in-game money (easy to get too) +You can look like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and be a cop at same time. +A lot of emblems to create for your character and some people can make amazing ones. +Trolling as cop Cons -PunkBuster, I call it PunkCluster. -Those who pay, gain TOTALLY OVERPOWERED advantage with their premium shottys. (Not much of those though on lvl1) -Very limited amount of character custom clothes if not paying. -On level 50 (like me) I got sniper (kills in 2 shots) shoot a guy 2 times, he teleports and kills me from 200 m with premiumshotty. -Servers sometimes really laggy and disconnecting.  So why I said no? Well I like this game a lot and REALLY recommend it for you, why not, its free, but personally, after 4 years, having 5 month pauses, I don't enjoy it. That's why. But that doesn't mean YOU don't enjoy it, I'm not here to say 'You can play this, you can't play this', i'm here to give my opinion. Thanks.
9354	0	a	Complete and total junk can't even gat past the create a charachter menu. When clicking 'CONFIRM' it just sits there doing nothing even when spammed  I would not recommend this game 2.5/10 atleast it runs
6990	0	a	Takes ages to set up, and once your in its very boring. even with your friends. 
7066	0	a	whats physx? 
743	1	a	Verry good game :)!!!! I recommend it too you !!!
3179	1	a	This is the best game ever in my opinion any way I recommend this at a 5 Star rate
4369	0	a	anyone who plays this game must like getting their male reproductive organs slammed in between a door for a living
4759	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
6333	0	a	It's a Pay2Win   it was better back in 2010 where you had to level up and buy your â¥â¥â¥â¥ with in game money not real   So Do i recomment this game?   â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-N-O
2623	1	a	I recommend anyone who likes online games and a relatively large arsenal of weapons...
9773	0	a	the game dont starts 
3121	1	a	pritty fun game reminds me of gta 5
2843	1	a	Fun way to kill some time, just don't take it seriously. The community on this game is awful.
363	1	a	One of my favorite multiplayer games of all time. Even after almost 4 years I still enjoy it. And G1 is clearing out the closet hackers and all the new hackers pretty fast now. If the community would just clean up and be patient for the new engine, we've got ourself one hell of a game. The game isn't Pay2Win either. The default STAR is in the top 10 guns in the game due to its easy use. It's mainly skill, luck, and positioning. Take your time with this games immense learning curv, meet the positive community members, and have a blast with some friends while making new ones.
4978	0	a	if you want to get camping police that camp at your objective, get this game  if you want to get owned by a guy that absorbs your whole magazine and insta kills you with 3 or 4 bullets, get this game  if u want to suffer failing missions because of camping policemen, get this game  4/10, too many camping pigs  all serious though i love the idea of being a criminal or a cop and doing missions while being able to customise your person or vehicles in many different ways but you will have an extremely difficult time playing, exspecially if your a criminal as you will get policemen that are like 30 or more levels above you camping at the objective and ruining your day. at random times a special weapon will appear and who ever has it when the timer runs out then they get it. normally the weapon makes them unkillable like one time where a grenade launcher spawned and while he was busy firing at the enemies infront of him i sneaked up behind him and fired a whole clip into his head before having him turning at the speed of light and blowing me to bits. when you are doing missions (mainly if your playing as a criminal) you will get to the very last objecitve and just when u reach it 3 policemen will just join the mission and pretty much make the mission impossible to complete. if this game was more balanced and didn't have people who are complete bullet sponges then i wouldn't of have uninstalled this game. overall i would recommend u get this game if you want to play as a policeman but if you want to be a law breaking criminal mastermind then u got no chance.
8991	1	a	One of the greatest MMO's currently in the market. I've literally played EVERY AAA MMO out there and this one takes the cake. It might be free but they really know how to keep the fun factor in without having a 'pay me to unlock this feature' screen in your face. I haven't seen any difference between paid players and free players and that's why this game has my utmost respect.  You're a clone that survived the apocalypse. Your old self is dead but you (the clone) are alive. You need to find an antidote to ensure your survival and with that you go through many zones and fight many people/monsters to do it.  The game map is ENORMOUS. It'd literally take you 15 minutes to get from one town to another. There are hundreds of towns in the game. There are also thousands of quests in the game. It is impossible to beat the game within 100 hours as you'll be enticed to explore. You'll find a random bunker in the middle of nowhere and it'll eat at your curiousity. What is it doing there? You step inside and get in an elevator. It takes you down underground (without so much a loading screen, mind you) into a factory filled with mutants. This game is huge in every respect.  You can also craft almost anything and everything you see other players wearing. Every weapon, ammo, horse, car, farm, helmet etc. is craftable. Money is a bit difficult to come by which simulates the real world well.  This game is a MUST PLAY for every hardcore MMO gamer/MMO connoisseur. There is so much to do when you hit the higher levels. It's a sandbox in every respect - as a high-level player you will spend a lot of your time attacking and capturing territory for your faction. As a low level player you will spend a lot of time witnessing the warfare between factions as you level.
10216	1	a	Worst f2p game in the world awful controls awful gameplay you spend most of the game getting stuff for people and all you ever get for compeleting quests are dumb books first person mode looks like you're playing it on gamecube
10259	1	a	My most Favorite game of all time .. This game has everything a wast lander could ask for, Open world(Sandbox) lots of equipment and weapons .. I truly love this game.
2253	1	a	I love this game but it does run slow but I do recommend this game.
9147	1	a	This game is cool for time consuming but it does have some realy bad bugs like on the first mission i finshied the mission and i couldnt take another one.
2748	1	a	i like this game its awosme but hard to buy cars 
8829	0	a	tried to launch this game for 5 hours ;{
2838	1	a	Played it for awhile too like planet side 2 but i dont understand such a thing O.O the Vehicle control really hard to learn.. and its fun never tried playing like police or something
8988	1	a	I certainly like the idea of a fallout like theme where everything is destroyed and so what humans remain alive have created forts and live off what remains of the old world. It's customization is certainly a nice feature. The fact that you can get ' Mounts ' or vehicles is certainly a awesome touch but with the size of the actual map it's clear to see why they are in this.   Since it is free to play there is no harm in giving this ago. I've spent meant hours in game and I do enjoy it and would reccommend it to other's.
4738	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
173	1	a	'Fresh and New' free to play.  With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.  Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.  Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.  Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a 'must play'? No. Is it horrible? No.   You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.  6.5/10
919	1	a	Realy good gameplay mechanics, lots of fun with friends, and what i love the most, is the consumazations you can do there, its one of the best ive seen so far, so much to do and so much to make, lets say your imagination is your creation. you can make your own style, design your car, and even design your own music and alot more stuff to do. But if you want the full experience you need to pay for it, so you are kinda limited to what you can make, thats the only bad thing i can say about it, but the free version is alot of fun to, if you like Gta types of games, multiplayer competetive and co-op , i realy recommend this ;)
10021	0	a	Having trouble linking it to Steam and I've reset my Steam password three times (which, with Authenticator every single time is a huge pain in the â¥â¥â¥). I've wasted two hours and a support ticket (with no response from the manufacturer).  0/5 stars. Even looking on thier gamersfirst.[com] forums, it seems like this has been a recurring problem since 2011.  Frankly, I'm so angry at a wasted evening at this point that I could spit.  I'd appreciate any advice.
3223	1	a	Typically pay 2 win... BUT it has a big pile of good content!
3013	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fun game in general, it's your basic shoot em up but it has a distinct twist of cops and robbers feel to it even though its just like any other game. What is realy surprising is that so much planning and detail went into it but the lag and the people running it our terrible. They gave up on the game but it's still fun to play if you deal with all the problems, its a load of fun especialy with friends and since its free, its a must have!  What stands out:  Fun with friends: 9/10 Lag level: 5/10 (thats bad btw) Design and Polishing: 8/10 OVERALL: a 7/10 but still worth playing! 
7590	0	a	This game have lag and its impossible to stay alive.You play 1 minute and you are dead.Really now,this game sucks.I don't recommmend this s***
55	1	a	  APB Reloaded - Siuya's Review 
622	1	a	best gta clone ever.
497	1	a	This game is bad. Not the room kind of bad with that classic cult feel or like those steam games you unironically enjoy for under $5 like runaway, nor even the LA Noire type of bad where everything is the just perfect â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥torm of cheesy that sucks you right in. No. This game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad. It's the kind of bad that just seeps into your pores and skin and constantly reminds you that while this game may have been free, it certaintly wasn't worth the piece of your soul for admission, even if the rampant free 2 play, awful controls and pedo vans won't haven't convinced you otherwise. In short: â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, it redesigned survival horror in ways Silent hill and resident evil could only wet dream about. 7.5/10 if only for the Richard Nixon mask. Would play again if drunk and forgot about the first time
1699	1	a	APB is a very good game. Belongs to the sand table style game can be where you let all can go. There are many ways to do the task, very interesting
3680	1	a	  Cool try this
3601	1	a	Well i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, ive played APB for a long time now and i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, who ever thinks it aint good screw all the haters
5291	0	a	Don't waste your time on this game
7695	0	a	It's a good enough game (Gameplay, Missions (kind of?))  But the one thing that let me down on this (now â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) game?  The community. DDoSers / DoSers, Hacks &amp; don't get me â¥â¥â¥â¥ing started on the micro-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-transactions!
1657	1	a	This game is both good and bad in many ways. Only really great thing is the customization. Servers are awful and very laggy, most of the time. Too many ARMAS weapons, way too many re-skins in the marketplace as well. (even though I have purchased a decent bit from armas) Missions are very repetitive, but who really reads the descriptions of them. The objectives seem to spawn in different areas often, but you may end up with the same actions there. Defend this, raid that, kill the enemy. And this game still has, in my opinion, one of the worst communities in gaming. Do good last mission? Everyone thinks you hack. Did bad? Your a noob. Using a armas gun? Noob. Using a free gun? Hacker. Im not even going to say anything about G1. EA is a better company, and look at what they did with BF4. (I know firsthand the brokenfield 4 problems) If you can ignore the ARMAS marketplace and the servers, APB: Reloaded is worth a try if you like free roam games. Or if you love the idea of playing cops and robbers in a MMO form.
3941	0	a	if gay mode was a thing it wud be called apb reloaded       o wait
5403	0	a	field field field warnning dont play this game if you dont want to kill youre self and always be angry this game is full of cheaters 60% of this game using cheates because all of them can make a fake account with 10min emails and use their cheates without gamersfrist ban they real accounts this game dont have any ip ban so if someone use cheates and anti cheate ban him he can make a new acc and use their cheates.  its one of many problems of this game other is: 1:this game have fps problem in the battels youre fps randomly go 10 from 90 im playing bf4 but i dont have fps prbolem so my pc is so good but i have fps drops on this game. 2:this game was not a p2w game in 3 years ago i played this game but now mrs tiggs make this game a full p2w game with many p2w weapons cars and perimums. but immportant is so many cheaters is already playing on this game this game have only one anti cheate and that is fairfight but they cant find any cheaters agin:D so i really dont reacommend this game for you guys i think soon this game lose all their players and everyone can see servers empty
1118	1	a	im in love. 20/10 would run over, mug, murder innocent civilians again!
250	1	a	Really fun game, Especially with a group of buds
10676	1	a	Best game! If you like TF2, CoD 2 and 4 and Quake and/or any quick play shooters, this is a game for you. As much as it is getting the 'bad' reviews its a greate game becouse of its fighting stile, 'skiing' and afterall just haveing fun with friends. Go pick it up now and if you rage before you are lvl 11 then you should play it still... If you still rage after lvl 11 (couse that is the breake point of when you can get most of the calsses, guns, stuff, skill) then yea, its not a game for you, or you are still really bad at it!!!  ITS FREEEEEEE... Not a lot of free games are awesome :/...This one along with TF2 and some others make an exception!!!
387	1	a	gut game, i rate 5/7 p2w
9744	0	a	no word to desscribe this ****ing game i take the download then a download in game that take 6 each
8658	0	a	The lag you'll experience is going to be â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unreal. Besides, so many p2w weapons have been added which can only be received through mystery boxes, this game went from awesome to complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash. Don't waste your time on it. Your skill doesn't count when everyone's teleporting due to the lag and p2w â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ spray the AMG Medusa all around you. Idk why g1 is so money hungry, little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s
9467	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.  I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.  The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.  All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.  
5332	0	a	Pathetic.  EDIT:  Wasted 6 years of my life on this sad excuse we call a game.
5554	0	a	Don't. Just don't. I can't decide who's more toxic: the player community or the GamersFirst (LOL more like MoneyFirst).
9902	1	a	Its like DayZ but with no zombies and fallout without the demon things
7274	0	a	Let me tell you exactly what happens when you start playing this game: 'Oh cool this is pretty neat character creation, Woah this is just like GTA! Alright lets go on a mission! Oh.. No one sent against me... No one.. No one.. Oh hey new Mission more people! Yeah We're kicking their faces! Woooh! BAM BAM! Awesome I'm feeling good lets do another mission! Wait.. Why do those guys have gold ic- OH GOD MY SPLEEN OH CRIPES MY LIVER! OH GOD NO HOW DO THEY KEEP KILLING ME!?'   And that's how the game continues on, it's nothing more but a free to play game heavily inserted into pay to win, You got money? you have permanent character upgrades. The mtchups are unbelievably unfair even in a matchmaking server.  Not Recomended unless you just want to go Crim and do nothing but carjack or ram into stores.
1933	1	a	i reccomend this game if you are going to play with a group of 2 or more, if i had to point out a negative about this game it is that it takes abit of time to launch so if yours doesnt open up instantly give it sometime,
9749	0	a	my verivacation didnt work!
8249	0	a	WTF is this â¥â¥â¥â¥!! dont just dont.
5015	0	a	Desparately needs some F2P servers, i've been in to far too many situations where I (as a bronze and silver, for a short time) have been put up against max rank golds with fully decked out characters. guns and cars. This game has absolute zero balance and unless you funnel half your life savings into their premium currency, you have no chance of getting anywhere.  Here's a tip for new players and people who are not vey good at FPS games; avoid the missions altogether, you'll be slaughtered every time an enemy spots you now matter what server/district you're on. The learning curve for this game isn't much of a curve, more like a vertical line.
10685	1	a	Play this game. NAO.
1159	1	a	Now before you write this off as a fanboy review, hear me out. Don't listen to the negitive reviews, this game is a ton of fun.   It plays a lot like GTA Online but in a free to play format. That sounds like a nightmare, i know, but it really isn't. It's kind of grindy, but that is to expect from a F2P game. Don't expect to have to play 100+ hours for a single item.  There is an endless amount of character and vehicle customization, this is half the fun for me. A really interesting thing they did with vehicles is how the radio works. You can import your songs and play them through the car, like the 'personal' radio channel in GTA. But wait, it gets better. Everyone in and around the vehicle can hear what you are playing, so the farther away the car is the less you can hear it. AND if you have the doors open(ie. when you are parked), the music is clear, and when the doors are closed, it's muffled. That's a very small thing to mention, but i like the attention to detail for this kind of stuff. I play this game myself and have made a few friends through this game, and it's a lot more fun if you have a friend to play with. Now, one of my favorite parts is that the chat is uncensored. It's hilarious.  Now for the bad:   The devs are almost non-existant. They're there, but updates are few and far between.  Hackers. They pretty much drove the game into the ground. The amount of people that play is low compared to any other similar game. FairFight keeps getting better, so there are a lot less hackers than there used to be.  And lastly, the textures and models are a little dated, gameplay could use some refining, and there are only 2 main maps. That being said, you are playing in a giant city so i can't complain wbout having more than one map.  If you can get past that, it's a really fun game to play, plus it's free, so it's definitely worth trying.  All 'n all, I would definitely reccomend this game.

4618	0	a	I have played this game for 287 hours and honestly was one of the worst experiences i have had in gaming. From the ridiulous leveling system, to the quite frankly pay to win aspect of the entire game, i would honestly NEVER recommend this game to anyone.  The community can be extremely toxic and vulgar, with casual swearing and slurs in chat, just a small anoyance, but nevertheless.  The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.  The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the 'you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents' attitude.  Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.  EDIT: Grammar stuffs

9629	1	a	RealChris said it all. Reminds me of a kinda 'Fallout Online' Crafting system. Auction system. Mounts. It's probably the best MMORPG i've ever gotten into so far. I'm still pretty new, but so far, this game is worth your time trying. Happy Scavenging!
2369	1	a	hello good game but when i am playing this game it says not responding lkfhjfskdkfdhgefhkjhfdl dato wers ase :D 
10474	0	a	This game seems to be good. It has some nice features that combine more traditional MMORPGs with things usually found only in singleplayer games. However, there is one major problem: LAG! Shooting is, while seemingly well-designed, virtually impossible outside of spray-and-pray. Melee faces similar issues, but is at least feasible. In other words - good game, but it requires too powerful of a computer for the level of graphics and ai complexity it offers. If you have a powerful computer, I recommend it. If not, then don't waste time trying to deal with the lag.

3943	0	a	This game used to be awesome. Keywords are 'used to'. Now it's just a circlejerk of hackers, rerollers - experienced players who make new characters 'cos can, troll characters - characters that are meant to look as hideous as possible, and a company that does a really poor job of not only getting rid of the hackers - they usually just ban innocent players - but making the game run well. It runs on an outdated engine and is poorly optimized. I have state-of-the-art hardware in my computer, and even with the graphics turned up to the fullest there is still aliasing, texture and animation problems. The company who owns this game, GamersFirst - they didn't make the game, but instead revived it from the company who originally created the game but had to shut down for some reason, can't even make good content for the game. The last, like, four weapons they've added have been reskins of existing weapons. But these ones you can only get by spending REAL MONEY to get, and it's not cheap either. Permenant weapons for a single character are forty dollars. FORTY DOLLARS. I could buy a completely new game with that.  The thing this game does well at is the customization, my God is it amazing... Only if you are a wizard at making symbols; otherwise you look absolutely stupid. The designers for symbols and themes - you can make a five second tune, usually an ear-piercing screech, that someone hears when you kill them or become MVP - aren't the most user friendly, and because of that there are only a handfull of people who can decently make them.  The gameplay is really repetitive and grindy; do the objectives and shoot the bad guys. The objectives don't mean crap, though. You can do all the objectives, but if you don't kill anyone you get barely anything. You level up at a snail's pace unless you, or course, spend REAL MONEY to get Premium, which allows you to get insane bonuses - something like 200% - to money and experience incomes.   I started playing this game right around the time it came out, and it was fun for a while, but for the past year the only thing that has kept me playing is the hope that GamersFirst would do SOMETHING to fix this crap-heap of a game. I would not reccomend you play it. If you do play it, however, do NOT spend any money on this game - it's dying, and fast.
5867	0	a	This game isnt bad but there are alot of hackers and not very fun when the game is free to play but its pay to win

837	1	a	This game is real example of hard work, this game has perfect engine and MMO world so I must say that this game is really good, gameplay is awesome, driving is less hard but don't matter. Anyway, this game is #1 from MMO games with 3rd Person View, no more words. AWESOME GAME! :)
1318	1	a	It is nice perfec i giwe it 10 of 10 rating
6308	0	a	This game sucks hell, Ive never been writing negative reviews, but because of APB this is my first time. First of all this game is so laggy, i check my ping on other games, its only 130 I am in saudi arabia, i joined Joker NA east Second this game is so buggy, and can cause your computer to crash any time, my computer crashed like 17 times A DAY because of this game. Third why cant we steal other criminal's cars? I mean Hello? We are criminals? we can steal anything we want. This game makes no sense at all.

3060	1	a	It's a fun game to play with 1 or more friends but alone It's not as fun. Still a great game.
6234	0	a	For the love of god, don't do missions. In my experience there's a lot of P2W out there. Although the customization and the worlds are great, the PvP makes ArcheBlade look easy.
3176	1	a	Good game a crap load of bugs, for instance it won't even install.
5172	0	a	When this game was first released (before being 'Reloaded'), I had really high hopes for this game. The videos of game play and the character creator looked amazing.  But this game fails on every front. The character creator is miserable to use, the interface lags and sometimes glitches, and the models are of the poorest texture quality. In fact, it was so miserable trying to make a character, that I quit and uninstalled the game before I ever got into the world.  Only GTA5 has a worse character creator. (But everything ELSE about that game at least makes up for it.)  It's free, so if you doubt me, go ahead and try it. The only thing you have to lose is your time.
7738	0	a	I really want to recommend this game, because there's so many things about it that are great, but overall it's just been way too hard to have an enjoyable experience with it.  The thing is that while the game has a lot of really cool systems to it, the massive amount of customization options, the GTA-style MMO gameplay, the massive potential for fun included in playing the game with friends, it's all entirely offset by the fact that the game's matchmaking is complete garbage. Four times out of five, you're matched up against opponents that are -way- higher rank than you, and often have weapons that far outclass yours, simply because they've paid a few bucks. This game completely embodies the 'pay-to-win' problem that a lot of Free to Play games encounter, and it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shame. When you're in a matchup against a guy who's more than five times your rank, and can kill you with three shots even if you've gotten the jump on him first, then what's even the point?
3517	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.

6703	0	a	If you like waiting extreme periods of time just to play a low graphics game, this is the game for you! When you first log in, you get to what I call the 'black box of death'. (And that after all the 10 other loading screens). Then you'll sit through 24 more loading screens and eventally wait 12 hours to get in a server, only to find that everyone is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that only kills you.

6200	0	a	foucking game 
9863	0	a	Honestly all I have to say is GamersFirst. Yeah, sure. Those guys are just trying to milk as much money from the Community of die-hard fans as possible before shutting the thing down. Game hasn't gotten ANY attention from the devs except for more micro-transactions.   Here's a micro-Transaction example: You can craft Cars in this game. And there is one really cool car. The fastest one with the biggest trunk and overall no other vehicle in the game is even close to beeing a competition to it. Now, if you want that car, you can craft for ages, hell, crafting the car takes ATLEAST 1 week, not farming the stuff for it, no, I mean the actual process of crafting it takes 1 Week. (Except if you pay real money you can boost it a really big ammount) The other way to get it is just to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it in the shop. Yay.   Also: Player customization. Character creation is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and all characters look ugly as â¥â¥â¥â¥. How do you fix an ugly Character? Awesome Clothing, you are absolutely right sir. Now when you first start the game, you notice the 'Wardrobe' slot in your gear-menu. Except the slots don't seem to work. huh. You have to buy the slots in PACKAGES. Or pay a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of money (I think it was arround 20 bucks) to get all of them.   And one of my absolute favourites is the endgame PvE: You have to buy an Shop-Item to summon the bosses. Yup. I just said it.   Not everything about the game is bad tho. It feels really rewarding when you build your first Dune buggy for example. I'm pretty sure you won't find any matches nowadays but I really had fun in PvP-Battlegrounds, atleast the Deathmatch one, but its Probably everyone using the exact same build in endgame.  It's for free, so check it out if you really want this to be good, but it's basically dead already.  And also read some other Reviews, everyone who's talking about the Enemy AI; the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Combat system or the boring Quests is absolutely right.

2244	1	a	Lags So much you would want to rip your own eyeballs out and jump of a clif  A lot of scammers   Devs are a$$holes  Sick a$$ seasonal events   Has a grenade launcher that fires snowballs  1000/10 would get addicted again
7962	0	a	Great concept for a game. Poor execution.
2172	1	a	Every game has its players that take the game seriously and play to the best of their abilities. But APB takes tryharding and trolling to a whole new level. These players just do not stop the tryharding my guess is they are Counter Strike Amatuer league rejects. Trust me you will get outplayed. and trolled.
9940	1	a	alot like fallout. all in all a great game
9860	1	a	Awesome mixture of rpg HUD + 3rd/first person shooting. WORTH
5323	0	a	Sadly I cant recomend this abysmal game to anyone, the screenshots make it look cool, REALLY COOL! but it fails on the worst design choices. The Driving is worse then Alone in the Dark (2008) im not kidding, and the Shooting is so hard to get a good shot, all this due to the DAMN CONTROLS BEING MORE UNRESPONSIVE THEN SHAQ FU ON THE SNES!   DONT BUY THIS SH**TY EXCUSE FOR A GAME, PLEASE DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID!
7675	0	a	Doesn't work for my computer or anything. Sadly i was hoping it would be cool to play.. :(
10170	1	a	Apart from the long grind this game has around lvl 5 and beyond. if you love fallout and post apocalyptic games then this for you
2274	1	a	This game is fun but you need to spend a lot of money if you want to play good. ( PAY TO WIN )
7089	0	a	So bugged game, first black screen loading at begginning , second so much lagging but i have a good pc to play it ....
1325	1	a	I started playing the game openmindedly and well yeah, Id highly recomend this game! Its alot of fun! Bit confusing at times and some aspects aren't the best but overall is a great game to play!
4932	0	a	FUAK YOU, THIS GAME IS BAD and IT SHOULD FEEEEEEEEL BAD.
1673	1	a	Really Good Action-Adventure And Third-Person Shooter With Co-op Missions!
3928	0	a	(For all of you looking at my 600 hours, I actually have 1000+).  Let me begin by saying that this is a one-of-a-kind MMO that I fell in love with the first time I was allowed into the closed beta. The games character customization blew me away, and quickly became my favorite part of the game, and to this day is the only thing I genuinely care about in terms of APB's overall content.   Combat is a different story. I can't even consider it to be combat much more than I consider it to be dancing. There's just a huge learning curve to this game. Back in the day, people use to jump and snipe. It was the most stupidest thing ever designed into a shooter. The game feels to be a bit ridiculous sometimes, that I just up and quit after about an hour. Along with that, I have a short list of complaints in my head with this game, and I'll just point have you read them here.   1: The community can be sort of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to new players. Even I at once would badger these 13 year old kids who barely found out what a microphone was, but I learned that it didn't help with anything, except maybe my ego. There are so many new players who just get put down by all the grizzled veterans that they see no reason to continue playing this god-forsaken game, and they would be pulling a smart move. There is a huge lack of motivation to stay in the game, unless of course you meet certain people that you can have a good time with. Even then however, the game makes it very hard to maintain a positive attitude.  #2: I use to part of a team of testers known back in the day as SPCI. It was a group picked by individuals who cared for the game, and also its testers. I admit I didn't do as much as others, but I was there when it came to the problems we faced. For one, whenever an upcoming patch needed testing, sometimes we were limited to only a day to do it. Now for most people, they couldn't test every day of the week, even me. Whoever could took a huge load of work. Once bugs and critical elements were reported, we'd expect G1 to be on top of these reports and fix them. This never ever happened in my experience. Sometimes these bugs wouldn't be addressed for months, sometimes never. It was this lack of action that made a lot of us question if what we were even doing was being appreciated. Eventually it all fell apart. Now there is a new team, whom I don't know, that either care about the game, or just want in on the upcoming content. In layman's terms, the new team to me feels like a bunch of complacant slaves who just want to have some 'imaginary' form of authority in the APB community. So yeah, G1 just needed people to test the game so that they could say they have a test team, and that's it. So far, they don't seem to care.   #3: This game is filled with people who use third-party software to get an advantage in the game (wallhacks, aimbots, etc). Not a single day goes by where I can play and all the opposing players play legit. Most of the time you can tell when your playing excellent players, sometimes it's a very thin line between legit and illegit. It's this thin line that makes people 'hackusate' even legit people, and it even gets legits banned. And even when the illegitimates get banned, there's no preventing them from being able to reroll. They'll just come back to rage-hack and continue being their immoral selves.   #4: This game will bring out the worst in you. It doesn't matter how much willpower you have, how much of a paragon/angel you are. This game will break you, no question. Most of the time, it's this reason people result in becoming illegitimates, because they either want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ on people, or because they don't want to spend the time to get better at something, and will use shortcuts to get their way. For people like me, who take it day by day, it is a struggle we endure for reasons even we don't really know. Maybe we hope for a day when the game will become what we always dreamed it to be. Maybe it's because we invested so much of our time into this game, we can't bare to let it go. The game has introduced me to some really good people, some of whom are good friends that I've known for years now. It's people like them that I wish filled the game, but sadly, the game is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, give or take a few.   #5: The Grind is very VERY real in this game. It is literally a requirement that you have premium from the get-go if you even want to finish this game in a relatively quick amount of time, and unless you like me, who wants to spend nearly 600 hours of gametime getting to R195, your gonna want premium. I have a 1000+ hours on my main character, and he's only 246 at the moment. In the near future, when contacts need even more repect points from you, I might just die of old age.  #6: Teamwork is something that people in this game ignore, which is funny, because it is literally the only thing that wins matches. Playing with a bunch of randoms does not help you in the slightest. Playing with people you know, people your on a voice chat with, is going to win you more games than just immitating a headless chicken (literally running in like a moron, with no strategic plan). So if your going to play this game, make friends fast, or get friends to play with you, so that you can get somewhere rather than nowhere.   In conclusion, this game has a great concept, but it's maintained by a bad company, who's only reason for buying it was to milk the living crap out of it. You'll notice really quick that this game has very little content push, and more flashy â¥â¥â¥â¥ with an expensive price tag on all of it. The clothes I like, but the guns and cars are G1's main source of income. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like had this game gone back to subscription based playing. I'd compare it to FFXIV, and say that more content would be added rather than ARMAS market items. In a way, I probably would have done subsciption over F2P. But it was never my call to begin with, so for now, I just go with the flow.   My score - 2/5   I still have high hopes for APB, but until then, I am not going to recommend it because it's not fun once the raging begins. If your really willing to punish yourself, learn from your mistakes, and learn to laugh at them as well, because your going in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride.   Word of warning: Be prepared to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on when you play.   On a side note, they should add some PVE to this game. Would help me relax a bit.  Along with that, enforcer activities (raiding a den, gathering intel, arresting drug dealers, etc.)
1746	1	a	fun but very pay to play
6268	0	a	Like GTA 4, but worse, and you can't do any missions because the other players are invincible.
5830	0	a	This game is horrible because there servers lag and there game lags for no reason with the best ping.There moderators are trolls i played the game for 3 hours then a moderator bans me permanantly for no apparent reason i didnt get and email of why i got banned i didnt do anything wrong.

5796	0	a	The game would always launch but the game would never actually start up, yet Steam would say it was running.
8378	0	a	Hackers , Hackers Everywhere !
2581	1	a	This game is amazing in every way. I recommend it because it is one of the best shooters out there, lets you customize anything you really want to: Cars, Character, Clothes Etc. If you're into the CoD series, you just might like this game although its not really like CoD, it's fast paced battles with Enforcers, (Cops) Versus Criminals. This game is not, however P2W(PaytoWin), but if you do play it P2W you might have an advantage over other players. This game has been INFESTED with hackers lately, I would not reccomend it Atm(At the moment).  I currently have an R229 Criminal on Colby(NA WEST) The name is SeemsLegitBro
7466	0	a	Quite the emptiest servers I have ever seen.
7768	0	a	Not that great.
7955	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.

4813	0	a	it wasted my hard drive space :( i uninstalled and had the same hard drive space as when i installed it .

4785	0	a	this game is a typical pay to win with guns that are immensely overpowered from the in game purchases
1384	1	a	It was alright when I played, I don't know if it's been updated to be actually worth the time/money. But overall, I have to recommend to at least try it.
1560	1	a	This game is very addicting! Great game to play with friends!
2473	1	a	It is like a mixture of GTA and Crimecraft. Except more badass!
7210	0	a	ever i start APB and launcher say error
8251	0	a	i cant play this game it just black screens
6560	0	a	This game is plauged with problems, from cashshop guns/overpowered guns, to match making issues, a cancer player base, to cheating, and basically zero new content while the content they have is broken.  Don't even install it.
8469	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
2695	1	a	very real.....good game 
2266	1	a	Really good and fair game. Without G1C you can do fine(Still be one of top).Report system work. G1C system is good as well because developers need and deserve money(So if you want to be fancy-donate). You can get almost anything for free with game money. Only problem are botters&amp;afk ppl.... they are all over FC:BS and silver districs.
1831	1	a	Did you like cops vs. robbers as a kid? Do you like games where there's no well-defined 'good' guy? Do you like the GTA games? Do you like Saints Row games? (no air or water vehicles, and no motorcycles) Do you like semi-controlled world PvP? Do you like team play? Do you like team battlefields? Do you like weapons, vehicle, and character customization? Do you like skulking around solo causing mischief? Do you like ramming into unsuspecting vehicles with a dump truck and watching them expand into a cloud of incandescent vapor?  APB may have what you're looking for. ^.^
5817	0	a	used to be a great game ....until GamersFirst got their hands on it.
4583	0	a	no just no GtA 5 with guns that u cant afford in a life time
4092	0	a	Boring and stupid... Play GTA IV or Saint's Row wait for GTA V don't download this free 2 play â¥â¥â¥â¥!
3038	1	a	Been playing this game on and off for years, and finally something somewhere was fixed and I can FINALLY play the game without server lag like I had all the time before. Now to get right into what I think and what you should/shouldn't expect.    If you're into a great balanced, and fair battle system, please stray as far away as possible from this game. APB has arguably the most back@ssed, unfair and poorly balanced gun mechanics I've ever seen in a game. I mean you could shoot the enemy in the face 10 times with a pistol and they won't die, I have literally hit people point black 100% accuracy with grenades and they took no damage and when they throw one in my general direction I went flying. The driving mechanics are also all miss, not even close to hitting but it gets the job done. Physics in this game do NOT EXIST. The missions get repetitive after a while, but you realize how much you need to do them to unlock everything so you'll have to bare with it. The matchmaking is also pretty terrible since there is no skill matching (at least that does its job) or level/rank system, so if you're starting out, have fun dying A LOT from people who have either been playing for a while and have better stuff than you or are hackers. That's another thing, this game is kinda old, and I feel like the developer just doesn't care much more about security so there are plenty of hackers.   Really, I'm sure by now you're probably going 'wow this game sounds like it sucks bad' but let me give you my reasoning as to why this is still one of the most interesting and worthwhile (for a little while at least) MMO's around.    Customization. This game does it better than any game around, unless maybe you're playing Black Desert or Sims 4. Absolutely amazing customization options for detailed character creation, tattoos, cars, custom music, all kinds of armor options, and more. Honestly I would consider this more of a social simulator with guns and cars than an actual third-person shooter MMO, since the focus on the personal and social aspects seem to carry a bit more weight. Graphically the game has held up surprisingly really well. One of the more pretty games you'll see from the last generation of MMO's (obviously no match for something like ArcheAge, Black Desert or Dirty Bomb though (but who really cares)) Another maybe little but big to me thing that I love is that you can import your own music from your computer into your in-game radio to listen to in the car which adds a nice bit of immersion, and yes I know I could just open up Spotify, but I just like having it this way.   If you go into this game expecting GTA or Saints Row quality gameplay, you'll be surely disappointed. This isn't bad though. This game doesn't really try to BE either of the two. If you love having vast and unique customization tools and just trying something other than the typical cookie-cutter MMORPG/FPS give it a try. Don't just go in for 30 minutes, really give it a good few hours, learn the game, unlock some stuff and feel it out. It may or may not be for you.
3536	1	a	the game is okay i wish there was no hackers p2w players are not the problem now its hackers i still play it. fun with friends, nice cars, cool events, hackers thumbs down, if you can handle hackers i recommend.
6060	0	a	As much as this game has provided me in endless hours of customization and havok-wreaking fun, it has provided me with double the amount of time wondering how a game with so much potential can be so.....broken. From the rampant cheaters to the lack of proper servers the game can be extraordinarily frustrating at times. The game it self is a Cops and Robbers themed MMO, a concept which could have been executed bery well but just seems to fall short in almost every area except for customization. If there is one positive thing that I can say about APB it is the detail and level of customization is astounding and can have even the most uncreative of people tapping into their wild side. This is also the major flaw of the game, as most of the money for development was spent in the Customization Programs.  All in all, this game can be fun at times, but will overall not be worth the time you put into it 5/10
384	1	a	Have you played GTA and like that sort of games? Then this is definitely something for you! Enforcers and criminals fight each other, choose your side, and play! - It's online :-)
3225	1	a	Awesome game, free version of GTA? probably.. yes sometimes you might get mad at this game but think again, at least your playing something. 
990	1	a	  Nice game
6832	0	a	srry but i dont like this game its very bad get spawn trapt bad tutorial
2472	1	a	Not as much as a Pay2Win as most of the other Free to plays but paying players will always be noticable. Gameplay can get a little confusing and frustrating with the lack of instruction. My biggest issue is that this game is a UI NIGHTMARE. I still have not yet figured out how to customize cars and characters. Firing weapons on full auto just makes the spread continuously grow and does not slow/stop between shots unless you lay off the trigger. Every car that is customized by the player lacks responsive steering severely but will improve when giving gas through corners, kind of like a reverse GTA4 handling (Cars in GTA4 are responsive but handle like garbage). I don't feel like I would recommend it but it does not deserve a not recommend.
10816	1	a	Really fun game, fun mechanics, fun weapons. Only one problem with the jetpacks; everyone has to rely on it, because most weapons are explosive, so no one tries to even airshot, and the jetpack is relied on too much and I find that really annoying. Everything else is fine though. 9/10.
1941	1	a	best game ever but no one play mission anymore
10422	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
6357	0	a	game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, doesnt work for windows 10
7373	0	a	this game always crash on me this game is suck â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5940	0	a	10 Hours Gameplay - Naydol/Thor ( Game Tester ) --------------------------------------------------------- - Pay2Win. - You can't do anything as a non premium user. + Fun with Co-Op - Get's bored after a while. - Lags too much.  I will rate it 4/10
4625	0	a	A great concept poorly implemented. A company that cares more about your money than it does about fixing or developing it's game. Childish toxic community. Hackers hackers hackers.
7332	0	a	my car looks cute my grill looks fresh my gun looks nice but this game is trash sometimes the truth doesn't rhyme
8084	0	a	This game sucks, it crashes every 5 minutes and I never even got the email to verify my account, i want the 4 hours of my life back that this game took away.
7166	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1610	1	a	The âJust 5 More Minutesâ Award  Fits Perfect for this ha
4546	0	a	The game itself is GOOD. But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.  I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.  Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement. Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.
1707	1	a	good game but it has some stability issues
2365	1	a	the game is good but the ranking system have to change but it is fun playing as both :) do get down and ply see ya in APB :)
1295	1	a	Tons of fun, once you get past the learning curve and actually understand the game its awesome. Recommended to play with friends.
8700	0	a	This game has potenital, it really does!  But its full of hackers, there is nowhere you can go an play where there wont be lots of hackers looking to ruin your day, they have a new anti hack that they says is getting rid of them, but as a player i can tell you i still play against hackers most matches, i cant play it anymore as the hackers just make it unplayable!  Update in 2016, So ive come back to this game and it is still in the same state. They have two antihacks and still the game is FULL of hackers, for the first time in years i redownloaded it and it is still full of them. It is clear that GamersFirst cannot solve the hacker issue and that they also dont care about it. If you put in a ticket about it they will ensure you that they are on top of it. Go into game and it is a different story. I was in a silver district and had been playing for 2 hours, 17 out of 20 matches had a hacker in it. So this game is clearly making no improvements. As much as i hate to say it, Battleye is better then the rubbish being used on APB. The only way this game will become playable is if someone else takes over from gamersfirst. Gamersfirst do not put gamers first at all, they put money first. They are making no attempt to fix this game.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, IT WILL DO NOTHING BUT INCREASE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND ANGER YOU!
7715	0	a	This was a massive waste of time. Its just GTA. only terrible.
5763	0	a	Have you always wanted to play in bland, dead worlds? Have you always wanted to play a lame GTA ripoff? Do you want to waste space on your computer hard drive?  If all of those answers are no, don't get this. GTA is worth the money.
1574	1	a	I like this game 9/10   Hackers :D    great game   alot of people play it
3745	1	a	It's a great game that i have played for a lot more hours then this indicates, by like 50x. but what made me stop playing originally (even though i've just come back) is the hackers, the crashes and mostly hackers at the time.  I still think this is one of the most impressive MMO's ever made and i hope i can enjoy it a bit now that i am back. do recommend that people try the game
10808	1	a	Sometimes i hate this game, but when you get the hang of it its fun. -Downsides Sometime pay2win People go faster tha bullets -Good stuff Everything!!!!!!
233	1	a	Very much like GTA, but less realistic
7582	0	a	I've played this game extensively before it came to Steam. If you're looking for a F2P version of GTA, this isn't it. Move along, nothing to see here.  It's not a bad game but it shouldn't be taken seriously. It's rife with hackers, griefers and players who will 'ghost' you during missions. You won't be able to kill them and they can follow you around, distract you, block your objectives, ram your vehicle and tell their allies exactly where you are.  The cash shop in this game is ridiculous. It's like Korean MMO-worthy. One gun can cost you $60 and that's just for a single gun. The monetization doesn't stop there...not on your life and it's incredibly Pay2Win as well.  Now, I know I was just complaining about how the game is full of griefers but to be honest that's really the most fun aspect of the game...doing stuff like taking 4 dumptrucks and blocking off a major highway or parking outside a car garage, leaving a little open space for cars to get through...and when they try to get through...moving in their way as they angrily yell at your immovable dumptruck, causing them to spend more money to re-spawn their vehicle elsewhere.  If you play the game with that kind of attitude, just messing around and having fun...it's not bad. But if you try to play the game seriously, you'll get punked out everytime by either hackers (which run rampant and unchecked) or people who have spent hundreds in the cash shop...or both.
1919	1	a	It is like the best game 
8759	0	a	It was good,it's bad now.
7883	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
8042	0	a	I wouldn't pay attention to the trailers. Very misleading. I trusted them and expected something like Grand Theft Auto, so of course I was interested. What I got was a cash-grabby clone with sloppy controls and cringe-worthy player base.  The game takes every moment as an opportunity to squeeze a couple bucks out of you. Seriously, 100 dollars for an expansion pack? That's ridiculous.  The controls are pretty bad- They are very unresponsive and sloppy, definately not what the trailer advertised.  Bad game, just shell out the money for Grand Theft Auto V. It's much better and probably cheaper in the long run.
7476	0	a	sucks so hard I bothered writing this
807	1	a	Amazing game of pvp where friends and family will love to play!
7264	0	a	-Pay2Win (Guns in-game can cost either $30 real dollars or 30hours of gaming (assuming you win most matches)) -Skillcap is just too high for new players (veterans have good gear, better weapons, upgrades, vehices, etc-cannot use certain things if level is too low) -Hackers/Cheaters -Noobs -No engine update
8570	0	a	The game has hardly any objective, the servers have a population of around 2-10 people. Everything in the game is played for.  Basically its a pay to win game making it automatically crap  Dont get, dont waste your time.
1812	1	a	This are the nicest game and i dont can stop play it
3136	1	a	IS THE BEST GAME IN WOLD 
6753	0	a	Rank 53 without knowledge against Rank 198. Mission Matchmaking System 11/10. Even Tetris is more fun.
5178	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
5157	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this game but the customization too strong girl I cant quit.
1720	1	a	This game is ok. I bought it back when Real Time Made it So Im still stuck on it as that time. I always hated game with a Weapon Rental system. That is the First thing gamers First Did to the game. This game Is Good if you like being mad cause It dont take long and it will put you there. There are unbalances and It has turned into more of a Pay to win type Game. So If you want to play for Pure Fun good luck and Dont get to upset.
10199	1	a	itÂ´s a good game, a bit difficult the further into the game you get. However, some obstacles have not stopped anyone from trying until you passed it. Any good gamer can agree.
6736	0	a	This game was doing for me little hope ... and I was not disapoint about uninstaller :)
1016	1	a	Practically GTA Online without the GTA
6519	0	a	Even though I like the setting and the customization options, the connection for me was completly unstable. I kept getting timed out every 10 minutes. Unless it runs better for you, I wouldn't recommend getting it.
9382	0	a	I played this for less than an hour, Then the moderators in the game were total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because I 'Wasn't asking questions or talking about the game in chat' instead I was saying things like 'Hey Guys, what's up!' and the moderators gave me a warning because it had nothing to do with the game... So making converation will get you banned..fun. 
7764	0	a	Worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing ever. i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing remmeber it being really good and non laggy at all but now it takes out all your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing memory in your computer and makes it unplayeable. even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gw2 runs smoothly then this garbage
2807	1	a	this game has change a lot but what sucks is low lvls get kill my higer lvl people but other than that the game is pretty good
9738	0	a	Its super buggy and a boring intro. I played for maybe 10 minutes and i couldn't play anymore. The worst of it was the visuals. I couldn't see my character like i made him, and most of the environment was transparent. I can see potential for this game if it was fixed up a lot
5335	0	a	If you like cops and robber pvp sure this is the game for you. Although, be warned that the damage system is all f*ck up and will only make you say WTF at every gun fight you enter.   Don't waste your time and money on this game, it doesnt worth it.
9333	0	a	I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me.   I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.
6909	0	a	no,it was OKKKKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Y ,well 
3650	1	a	Gang wars with awesome character customatization. I love the game but the only problem is that the developers (thats my opinion not your) dont put too much love to the game because they only add new guns with skins and you need to buy them with money and they do not optimize the game, to make APB more realistic and to increase the quality of the graphics. I mean that is too bad but I give the pozitive review in a hope that the game will be better in the future.
4266	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥
5918	0	a	Can this pile of garbage just die already I am tired of seeing 'UPDATE' on steam, it pisses me off because this game is total crap.
2797	1	a	The overpowered paid weapons and occasionally inappropriate match-making cause this game to be unbalanced. Otherwise it's a pretty decent multiplayer shooter and it enables comprehensive avatar making. More fun if playing with friends.
10351	1	a	fallout mmo takes time to do anything

6048	0	a	stay away from apb, unless you're a masochistic.
2716	1	a	:)
3505	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.
3056	1	a	Spent three hours making a sticker 18/10
7251	0	a	Spent 26 or so hours on the game, So.. Have enough room to talk. The game? Good. The servers? unplayable. If you're not lagging all over the place , Players don't even go into their own districts. Yes, their is districts. I'm threat level silver, But, If I go into silver district, theirs gold threat everywhere, and if you go into ANY lobby with them on the other team? Have fun dieng 40 times &amp; losing. Their is no way to beat them, as they have better weapons, armor, cars, etc.. Which, forces people into lower districts, meaning silver threat go to bronze, and.. as you can already tell, that creates 2 more problems. 1: pretty much the same thing, bronze can't kill silver. And, You get raged at if you are, silver.   So.. I give this game 3/10. Will play it, But NEVER recommend it. Nor invite friends to it. The Devs don't seem to do anything about it. And due to server issue/districts , The only time you'll have fun, is when you're killing people at a noticeable level below you. Which.. Gives 0 satisfaction that you're doing.. anything.
1773	1	a	A lot of the combat can be extremely one sided sometimes, especially with a group of friends who know what they are doing, and have ranks in the 200's. BUT, What keeps this positive for me is how fun it can be to just mess around and troll people, as well as the customization. I can't give the most detailed review, if you want that, look at all of the others.
5002	0	a	This game was fun, until you ranked up and fight with all the p2w there is. Unless you are willing to cough the dough, then do not bother playing this.
8506	0	a	Just a load of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
3272	1	a	this game is awesone
3209	1	a	This game is actually really fun once you get past the steep learning curve. It will put you through hell in the start but once you get used to it things do get a lot better. The only downside is the hackers that run around but they are rare to run into. Just play for fun and and all is well.  I have to edit this review because although it can be a fun game, and it's not necessarily a bad game, this game is dated. There's supposedly going to be an engine upgrade and it seems like it's never coming but it's suppose to be soon. And with that, more bugs! The few things this game lacks is innovation and optimization. Match making is terrible, guns are hardley ever balanced and servers are still not up to par.  I'm still recommending this game for those wishing to play something with a GTA Online feel that's free to play.
7900	0	a	I used to play this game alot, must have spent over 200 bucks on content since the first run of this game back when it first came to F2P. hmmmm. $200, F2P..... something doesn't sound right here.....
1328	1	a	this game is good, i made a character named LegolasTheGreat and put custom made swastikas and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on his shirt, so far ppl have been telling me that im reported and i should kill myself cuz im a nazi monster. im not getting banned long time, tho. so if u wanna burst some bubbles and make some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ butthurt - this game is for you, cuz u can design the ultimate nazi gear.
3084	1	a	If you like playing GTA with forgeign, children, and hackers this game is for you!
2558	1	a	Very fun to play with friends or without friends. Either way, it's solid. Being a good change to other MMOs. The game looks amazing and even with minium settings. 8/10 stars.
7868	0	a	Game won't load. But I wouldn't say its bad. Just putting thumbs down because it won't start up.
7219	0	a	Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tbh, anyone thinking to get into this game should just buy The Division.  Everything APB does, The Division does better imo.

7246	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.

3846	0	a	Matchmaking is absolutely god-awful. Expect to be matched with people several tiers below your level against max rank players. Half of all the rounds I've played have been unfairly skewed in the opponent's favor. Of course, I shouldn't be bashing new players for being bad- we all once were- but I do start to get a little annoyed when I'm being placed in a team with them on a very consistent basis.  In addition, this game is infested with cheaters/macroers. Ok, maybe I'm in no position to start 'hackusating' others- I have no proof whatsoever- but when people maintain *perfect* accuracy at long distances/whilst jumping, know where you are, whenever you are and come to kill you no matter how many walls there are between you and them, then maybe, just maybe, there's something to be suspicious about.   That's all I have to stay. Please, just stay away. This game needs to die.
5860	0	a	The launcher of this game was made by drunk two year olds.
7681	0	a	I am not able to play this game.Every time i try to play it i press start and it doesn't load the game. My friend has the same problem.I am really disapointed. ;{
2557	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
8904	1	a	i actually enjoyed playing this game, it is different, but i think it is still a bit too buggy for my taste, getting stuck in the respawn tube or transporting, or even just on pebbles in the road this needs an update badly to fix some issues then it would be awsome like fallout on crack, but now its fallout if fallout was that one 'special' student we all had in our class growing up, but still i think it is very much worth a try, the devs should open it up to allow fans to maybe help them make better and newer patches for the game, just an idea
1157	1	a	This game is so awesome in so many ways that I can't even describe, the customization system (amazing), graphics (pretty good) everything is good in this game but I would like the game to be patched because it still has some bugs so I really hope you get that fixed.
10107	1	a	A Cool F2P Apocalypse game!
3937	0	a	its good but not optimized very well, for this reason i do not recommend this game
10460	1	a	Come Play Fallen Earth I used to play WoW, then I grew up.. Melee is a good way to find me shooting you in the face! If you love to craft and build a character then Fallen EArth is for you. Lastly this is a ! sever game so no hiding, active GM at alll times. Exellent Community of gamers also. Come get some I freaking Dare ya! Edit : No active GMs, game is very much alive, still a vast world to explore. This game requires a high intelligence, reading, thinking and a high amount of patience. Free too play not Play to win and that is always a plus!
1710	1	a	dont play this game
6014	0	a	I played a little bit I guess.  Pay 2 Win.
50	1	a	Figure its time for an update, I started playing apb about 2 years ago and in that time have put in around 4000 hours of gameplay. I really do enjoy this game and I feel people deserve an unbiased opinion before trying it out. So I present both positive and negative points here.   First lets talk about hackers, everybody says hackers this hackerst that. No. period. Yes like any online game there is hackers, lets take any given day though, I do around 25-40 missions on any given day, maybe one or two of those missions will have a hacker in them. In fight club its a bit different, there is no missions its just the same stuff over and over kinda an easy place to farm kills close quarters and stuff so hackers go in there and use an aimbot but again thats not an all the time thing its just something that happens because hey its an online game.   Next lets talk about 'Pay 2 Win' some don't know the actual meaning of that phrase so im going to explain, P2W means that you can pay cash money for an instant advantage over others in game. Now to some extent I guess you could say its pay to win in that manner, the actual cash shop 'Armas Marketplace' has various things, cars, guns, etc. The difference is you can buy them account bound, say you buy a 3 slot gun (slots being open for modifications that change guns ie: mag pull allows you to reload faster at the cost of a set ammount of ammo being short from the clip, where as extended mags has more ammo to a clip but takes longer to reload. They are unlocked in game and cant be used until you hit rank 40 which takes about a day or two) and you got it account bound, well you could have this gun with 3 slots on it on a new character, but that doesnt change much, all guns that you can get from armas marketplace are either reskins (same mechanics as the normal gun just different look and sound ultimately feeling different but having no advantage over the original gun) of the guns in game or they are available to buy with joker tickets which can be earned by doing daily activities and playing in fight club. Or you could buy a car, say you play as a criminal but you want a car from the enforcer faction such as the Jericho, you can buy that on armas with 4 slots and drive it on your criminal. There is also clothing packs/items and weapon skins/camos available but none of this changes the base of the game, however the game does have premium on armas marketplace as well which all that does is give a substantial increase to money and exp gain as well as allow you to have up to i think 100 symbols per item (not sure i dont customize often) set your clan name as a title so people can see it easier, and lowers the cool down on your active character mod by one minute. I personally have around 2,000$ (two thousand) in my account because its what i enjoy so I support them and will continue to. I have i think 35-40 account bound guns, most of the clothing packs, key to the world, key to the city, and almost every car as a 4 slot through armas on my main character.   Moving on, next topic, the game engine is currently unreal engine 2 but they have been working on a new engine for a few years and it is almost ready for release, read into it more on the forums and blog posts.   Customization, its a big deal in apb and I have honestly never seen another game with such an in depth character customization.   Im honestly too lazy to continue this review and would rather just go play the game instead of talking about it, however if you have any questions feel free to add me and ask, or even watch my steam broadcast im playing 70% of the time.
9956	0	a	Horrible game. The interface is clumsy and unintuative, even with customization. The graphics are sub-par, and hardly anything in the game can be interacted with, even though there are what appear to be useful items strewn about. Don't waste your time with this one.
7819	0	a	I played this game before it's official relaunch. However back then the game could barely run on any systems. Now after playing it on the relaunch only makes this title no justice. As it's full of cheaters and hackers with aimbot and wallhack. The game itself has awsome graphics for it's time and nice visuals. Somewhat large ``worldsÂ´Â´ to raom in tho they are 2 diffrent parts of the city of San Paro. But as said the game is now full of cheaters and hackers making this titel nothing worth playing. 
4267	0	a	The customization on this game is really good i must admit for quite an old game.  Pretty fun at start rekting people. Occasionally you get them hackers... not fun.  However, I really Hate the weapons that have this 30 day buy deal or Permenant deal for a certain price which then gets expired. It REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks and not a great system imo. It also sucks how you buy a perk in the game; For example, the Car Sufer mod, when i bought it with earned money inside the game i was so excited and I thought it was permenant? But nope. It wasn't. It really sucked.. Quit after that happened.  You play deathmatch and people have Rocket Launchers = instant death. Not fun. This game has died out many years ago. Wish they didn't sell it to this new company.. But heyho.. it happens. Buisness is Buisness.  In the end, I played this game since the beta and just recently got back into it. I have 85.8hrs in total and I would recommend this game if you have friends its really fun. But soloing is pretty boring after a while.  Other than that I dont think this game is worth playing anymore. It has had it's chance and it failed.

6294	0	a	Played it.. sucks. Too many things happening, crappy controls, ugly graphics.. not worth 'Free to Play'
10117	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
6566	0	a	It is a great game however, they need more free features in the game. Technically the game is pay to win, thats why I did not enjoy playing it :(
2714	1	a	Best tps F2p game IMO
1373	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
8021	0	a	So hmm, this game is awsome, the features and combat system is amazing the only down about this game is that theres too many hackers. Idk if hacks are easy to get in apb but you can see one hacker in almost every missions u play
4357	0	a	I played this game for more hours that I'm proud to admit (over 1000), even before Reloaded 'revived' it, and way before it was in Steam.  So here's my humble review...   THE GOOD
6866	0	a	Haven't even had a chance to play because the registry is.... 'unusual' or for a better discriptive term, it's garbage. I've been waiting for over half an hour for my verification email and nothing has shown up so far. So before I even get a chance to play I already have my review made up for this, uh, game.. I mean I really can't complain much because I see a game that is free to play ES Online, and how garbage that turned out, but at least with this I didn't waste my cash on a $60 game only to not be able to sign in due to lack of servers. BUT that doesn't excuse the fact that I want to give this game APB a chance, but I'm very disheartened due to the fact I have yet to get a verification email. THUMBS DOWN!   I might make another review and change it later after my hair turns grey from waiting..,

4587	0	a	Personal Rating: 3/10  What's there to say about this game? It's not fun. To be honest I don't know how I sunk over an hour of my life into this catastrophe of a game. In essence, it's a GTA clone. When entering the game it turns into a Saints Row clone. Two remarkable games, should be easy to copy, right? Wrong. The controls, awful and clunky, especially in vehicles. What's the point of the game you ask? â¥â¥â¥â¥ if I know, there isn't one by the looks of things. You get plonked into a game and told to do, something...  It isn't established. There isn't a plot point, your character has no name, no tutorial, no nothing. If this game weren't free then I'd steer clear of it. But even then, it's free, so don't download it. Save yourself the time and go play some of the variables. Maybe buy a GameCube and play True Crime?

4817	0	a	Don't play it. It's as simple as that.  It's an interesting concept but it was poorly executed, has terrible graphics and has a horrible, horrible... HORRIBLE community surrounding it.  I honestly don't know if this game is relevant enough to even consider thinking of downloading, just because of how awful it is.
6138	0	a	This game is worse than giving birth to a fully sized man,everyone is generic fagot no.1 with a white wife beater on.The gun play is â¥â¥â¥ cuz you have generic pea shooter one and some kid whop got his mothers paypal can one shot you with some 5 dollah gun.theres nothing to do in this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥,after ten minutes of playing I was contemplating suicide.If you have no dollah and want to play something worse that rough anal with a door knop then I advice to try out this pay to win musical produced by the one and only steam free to play section.   P.S guns don't penetrate glass windows,players,nps,or your own â¥â¥â¥â¥ing skull once you try to end it all :( 7/11 Ign would un install again
6207	0	a	  Worst Pay to win unfriendly Beginner unbalanced â¥â¥â¥â¥ game you will ever play Rating 1/100  Can't even start or i get a guy with 30 ranks higher in the enemy team with a sniper  
4849	0	a	it is an alright sandbox game with what you would expect but it suffers from many of the usual free to play problems evrything is way to grindy some guns are just straight up better than others and in general the gunplay isnt fun i wouldnt reccomend this game unless you had some friends to play with for a little bit

1389	1	a	Lots of fun, if you don't mind a cops &amp; robbers style FPS that is somewhat 3rd person. Along with the fact that its VERY pay to win based. Playing it F2P is still tons better than almost every other F2P game that has P2P options.
9497	0	a	game wouldn't load  -100/â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
5993	0	a	Pay to win is BS you have no actual degree of skill if you support pay to win games 
2751	1	a	The potential of this game is high and that was already noted in the fact that it was picked up by a secondary company and 'reloaded' to make it into at least something worth playing. The main issue with the game i would probably say is funding as it is a free to play game. I would say this isn't normally to much of an issue if they would have re-released it and then balanced it or at least tried to balance it. With that said you will find yourself constantly out matched, out gunned, and battered into submission by the other players. That is until you make it to the tip top and can finally find some way to hold your own. If the enemy players arn't enough to get to you, the chances that your own team's derogatory comments will. If you can handle the backlash from your own team, the constant balance issues, and the lack of dev well everything then enjoy.
530	1	a	I would have to say, the customization in this game is WAY better than GTA 5. By a long shot  I think this game deserves a thumb up because:  - It adds a compeitive feeling.  - The customization is unlimited. You can pretty much customize everything.  - The graphics are great and beat some games that are newer than APB  Cons -   - Since the game has been out for so long, people have more OP weapons. Or they buy them from ARMAS Market  - We've been playing the same missions for five years. Please add more,  - Some character issues like your eyes not moving, No jiggle bones on b()()bs.  - Some other small bugs.
9177	1	a	I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe. The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.  It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy. FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.  7/10 in my opinion to say the least.

WAIT NO THE WAY YOU MAKE YOURSELF IN THE GAME JUST DOESNT WORK THE GAME IS SO UNFINISHED ITS JUST REALLY BAD I WANT MY 1.2 HOURS BACK.
4338	0	a	Waste of time the game dont start for me Burn you 2011 piece of Sh**
3484	1	a	Lets start this off by saying I have 1k+ hours in this game. This game is really not for everyone, its kind of clunky, buggy and irritating. But if you can look past that to the simple joys such as spending hours in a customizer making your character look like a true badass or pulling off amazing stunts in combat it makes it all seem worth it. A lot of this games problem is it rarely gets new players, this is because the vets who've played this game for thosands of hours drive off the newbies. People are toxic, they spew hate and slaughter newbies as a past time. It also has lots of problems with hackers as its a F2P. However it can be incredibly fun, and the people you meet are awesome. I won't say the game doesn't have problems, but if you can pass the trial by fire it opens up. We need new players badly the game can't really fix the problems it has unless we get new players. So its up to you the consumer to decide if you're tough enough to make it in san paro, you'll get your â¥â¥â¥ beat but make sure you get some good hits in and keep at it and you'll make it.
244	1	a	Been playing this for a long time and still I can't get bored. Better than GTA and right under Saints Row The Third. I love the overall story, customization, adding music and the deathmatch servers.

891	1	a	After playing this game I strongly recommend you to play this game and not read any of the non recommended games. To me personal this game is like every other game hard at first but you get the hang of it and it becomes fun! Whats a game without challenge!! Besides, it's free whats their to lose? I strongly recommend this game to anyone! A fun GTA 5 like Game with a good servers that are almost all the time full with 100 people!
3740	1	a	A poor mans GTA V so why not get it right it's free doesnt have much game content but it is still fun to play but it does have some pay to win aspects
6958	0	a	As of now i cant even spawn i try over and over and i can't spawn and until they fix this i would not recomend unless you would like to sit through 5 minutes of loading screens for the game to crash.

Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.

1000	1	a	This game is unique and insane! So goooooooood!  Pay to win? More or less, this game is free, but this is more about skills than money, all reviews talking about 'p2w' is from crying babies.  I spent a lot of money in this game already, I have good weapons, good stuffs but a player without cash but knows how to play, can beat anyone easy.

And by helpful i mean they will help you  Die and Lose missions by blocking your car or placeing their own vehicle over the drop zone. And great freinds who will kill you as soon as look at you. And of coarse everyone has something nice to say. Usually lots of kind words that happen to have only 4 letters. Any way ... if your head is not in a toilet somewhere go ahead and get this game. its awsome.

9074	1	a	When I first started this game, I was expecting my computer to not be able to run it from the images. Luckily, the game ran a scan of my computer and optimized it for my computer and I run at max FPS. It is Fallout Online which I love. My issues with the game are that the graphics are not as beautiful as I would like but it is incredible for when it was released back in like 2008. When I start up the launcher and try to launch it, it will either tell me I cannot connect to internet (which is usually true) or that the server is having an issue, and also, lets not forget, this is a game where you are asked to upgrade but you do not need to, it is a one time request. However, disregarding the graphics, age, upgrading, and techincal issues, it does everything masterfully. You can craft and it is not instantly created, making it more realistic, you get a vehicle (horse) from the very beginning so you don't have to walk all over the Grand Canyon. You get a speed boost when you ride on the main roads, you can roleplay and go killing other players who are in PvP mode. I recommend it to anyone who loves Fallout and is dying to play it online with people.
814	1	a	This is my favorite game ! But you can add some new events like races clan battles or something like this!
3763	0	a	The Good, The Bad, The Ugly  |Review|   The good:   If you love playing cops 'n robbers in various areas of a city, crashing into shops and stealing loot or arresting criminals and returning the stolen goods this game is for you. On top of that you have a VERY detailed customization system that will keep you occupied as well as composing music when you die to making detailed symbols and pictures. A decent ammount of guns and equipment sets give you various different styles of gameplay and approaches to certain missions. If you want to take a break from the chaos of the city and just want to shoot people they have TDM maps where you can frag at your leisure. As one of my most played games in my library I found much enjoyment in this game and even though I go on hiatus from time to time I will find myself crawling back eventually.    The BAD:   Its really a shame that Real time worlds (the original creators of the game) went bankrupt because they rushed a game that could of been something so much greater than what it is now. Even though it was brought back to life and handed over to some free to play company no one has ever heard of I was still glad it was given a second chance. From the start I had high hopes that GamersFrist would give this game some dignity and held that vision that some of the core developers of this game had. However even for as long as they have had the game you can't notice much change in the game itself. Yes they have events but its just mission events that really don't mean anything, its just regular missions painted in what ever holiday it happens to be. Also there used to be a good rapport between the GF and the gaming community. Maybe that has changed but since then but I left when we didn't hear a world from our devs and were swimming in problems...   The FRIGGIN' UGLY:  Of course free to play comes at a cost. How are they going to fund this game and create more content for the players and make this game better? Microtransactions. A concept on paper that really (at least in my opinion) seems harmless. But when a company MAINLY focuses on the content for thier in game shop you begin to see the true colors of what thier intent is. With little to almost nonexistant game updates, content and almost some new item every week in the in game store you can notice that either...   A) someone is having money trouble B) Cash cow circle jerk  This game to me was a work of art and gave me so much fun and enjoyment that I wish thier marketing schemes didn't get to me. If you think i'm â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ting you just look at thier facebook account. THERE IS BARLEY ANY OTHER POSTS OTHER THAN ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIER SHOP ITEMS. Zero â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t go look... All this makes the player not want to even log in... Its that obnoxious. But I get it, you got to make some money. But how about make the game more enjoyable, make the gamers keep coming back and of course they'll buy something. Don't pray on the very few people in your community that spends hundreds of dollars on in game items.   THIS. IS. WHAT. MAKES. YOU. SO. DAMN. UNATTRACTIVE.  This was a major issue for me but other uglies include.  -low pop -meh ranking system -has been almost the same since beta.   Take it or leave it folks. Thumbs down but take a peak anyways. You might not care about the advert spam. Maybe its changed.

3076	1	a	This game could be a good replacement for GTA if you get past the lagging when you drive !!
7899	0	a	I played this game just a bit, and I realised that there was no point on installing it. It's unbalanced and boring as hell.
10378	1	a	As Space Cowboy said below 'IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).  Why, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.  STORY: The background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.   MAP: The map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that â¥â¥â¥â¥ is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.   CRAFTING:  Forget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE â¥â¥â¥â¥.   You can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad â¥â¥â¥ mode on a bike.  You can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.  Craft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it.   Also, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.   After all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.   COMBAT: It's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.  The game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.  PVP:  Awesome.  The game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.  The game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.  The game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.  MORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS): - Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special. - F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it). - Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc. - Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat. - A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends). - A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday.  - Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).  - Deep and beautiful scenarios. - Scary voiceover (turn it off, man). - You have a flashlight. - Immersion feel on every step you take. - Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world. - Awesome PvP. - You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast &amp; Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback. - You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?) - Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.  CONS: - One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth. - Performance issues on some PCs. - 'Dated' graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!) - 'Hardcore', even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game 'hardcore' for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point. - Unfriendly interface and learning curve.'  I agree 100% with him however ask me if I give a crud about graphics and I'll say no because I have been playing on a crappy pc with graphics as low as possible4 unlike him playing UO for 11 years [good game tho]. I definitaly recomend this game. It's the only game I am willing to spend real money on other then GTAV

930	1	a	Definitely a game with a lot of potential.. Although their servers are a bit dusty, it doesn't mean that the game isn't worth trying out. You can spent a lot of hours just trying to customize your character, running around like a cop or a criminal. If it's possible, try to get some of your friends to play it with you. I wouldn't say that you need to play with friends, but games are always funnier when you can play them with your friends! (:
754	1	a	I've played this game more than 200h and its still fun. =DD
8444	0	a	Can't even play the game until I leave a Like on their facebook page?! Are you kidding me? Firstly how am I supposed to know if I like your game unless you let me play it first and secondly are you so insecure about it that you have to beg for likes before you let people see it? Uninstalled, pathetic.

4704	0	a	This game is terrible for beginers and horrible for solo play. if you can make friends and play it isnt so bad, but when they are off (and the game is dead so chances are they will not be on) the matchmaking litterally works to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. G1, who hosts the game, cant give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the players, not even the PR Tiggs even plays the game on a regular basis. maybe when the engine update releases the game will be better. RIP APB:R

6146	0	a	It's fun when you ram raid, but missions aren't. Most of the time, you verse high ranking, high threat people, who tote OP Pay To Win weapons. There are also people who camp on streets and witness you doing a ram raid, and farm you for kills, stealing any money not taken to a Money Laundrey. Performance issues are a big problem, and no Australian servers, just Hong Kong NA East, West. This game has been revived by many companies and has recently got a new anti-hack system, but to be honest, it's not worth saving. 45%
9015	1	a	= )
2877	1	a	it is a cool game  
2204	1	a	This is such a great game. It's basically Grand Theft Auto but you're playing with and also against other people online. It is funny and very entertaining. The graphics are amazing and you need a really good computer. But, best of all, it's FREE. Download it, trust me.
10740	1	a	niceeeeeeeee fast paced game,but kinda hard for starter players.I recommend to new players not see training's videos because they are kinda old,so go to youtube better choise
7640	0	a	dont even bother, the devs are milking this game for every micro transaction its worth and then some.

8227	0	a	Hella fun game at first, but very quickly lost interest because of all the people purchasing super strong â¥â¥â¥â¥ with real money. Felt very pay to play to me.  Upside of the games are that it feels like a funny version of GTA, but more MMOish. Fun gunplay (until you get oneshotted over and over by people with OP weapons) 
2040	1	a	I'm tom cruise and I say this game is good.  I like pie.
7488	0	a	Alright, so I downloaded this in 2 hours. I was all happy about playing. Started playing, I loved customization, but then, when it came to playing, it was horrible, Enforcers are OVERPOWERED, with the stun guns, it's impossible to play. Don't waste time. Play some real things instead.
6016	0	a	No would help me. I couldnt complete missions and wasnt that good as a game.
10647	1	a	The game is very unique, i've never played a game like. While i dont have alot of hours in on it my other account has much more, this game is worth learning to play the mechanics are cool to me and the classes are really different from the others. I reccomend this game to those that have played quake and team fortress 2 if you play team fortess 2 there is a sort of rocket jumping in this game with the pathfinder.
3540	1	a	Noice game over all tbh
5166	0	a	Pay to win and laggy servers, BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW FLOCKAVELLI.
9652	1	a	this game isnt actuallt free to play :( 
9933	1	a	played it before. wanna try it again. =D
2089	1	a	This game has the best customization, hands down, BUT it's cameplay is imbalanced, and very much so pay2win, but even then, it's fun to play.  For those that jsut like doing random crap and looting random places, play it.  For those who are more competitive, or easily angered when killed, I wouldn't reccomend playing it.
2489	1	a	The best game I've probably ever played, and one that consumes all my time. A new kind of MMOTPS. It's a GTA like game where good guys (Enforcers) fight to keep the streets clean from the bad guys (Crims). So choose your side, and go be all you can't be!
9828	0	a	  this game is horrible it was only letting me do the same things over and over again such as press play but it will not do anything and accept the terms of service
7311	0	a	Framrate issues. Very P2P and rage indusing for new people. It has its moments.
1459	1	a	I've played this game so many hours (mostly before i have been released on steam). I have spent so many hours in the social district to create and design my own clothes and cars. To sell them for a good amount of ingame money.  But also the multiplayer experience is fun.  It brings some issues with it but i think it is still enjoyable.  Pros:  -open world -fully customizable cars and clothes -quick missions with a lot of action -aimbased shooter -a quiet nice community  Contras: -a lot of hackers -sometimes laggy -update dates takes too long
148	1	a	MEDIOCRE GAME BUT IT GIVES YOU FREEDOM WHICH CAUSES ANARCHY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE POLICE. 6.66/10
2033	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
3551	1	a	I love this game cuz ist very good and fun to play alone or with your friends
5965	0	a	no no no no no no no no no after waiting for 2.5 hours for this joke to download then had to register to play it only to find out i have to download it again while its just finished downloading i will unistall after this full stop.
1319	1	a	Good game when you spend a little money on. :) Worth the wait of downloading
858	1	a	literally full of kids that cant afford csgo so they play this garbage

10453	1	a	Got killed by a crab that had a computer monitor as its shell.   10/10
7333	0	a	worst game on Steam! The game has TONS of cheaters and noobs the game isnt fair ,the cops are over-powered  gamersfirst made the Premium accounts get alot more than the f2p users this game the biggest example for the worst game and pay 2 win game.  DONT DOWNLOAD IT
6206	0	a	I've +500 hours (without steam) and i can easily say that devs don't care anymore. They don't try to keep cheats away. They just ban the ones using 'DETECTED' cheats. That isn't instant so they just open new accounts and keep cheating. Also you can pay for cheat. It is called 'ARMAS MARKETPLACE'. You can buy some weapons that is equal to cheat. You won't get banned for that though. By the way, when there is a patch i would get excited. I thought they will bring something new and good for the game. Every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time i check the updates, I see more overpowered weapons and more bugs. Game is done for me.
4400	0	a	Everything is either really high rank or payed for with real cash.
7544	0	a	need alot of revison and alot of balnce 
3039	1	a	Great game.
5083	0	a	If you want bugs, bugs, and more bugs, and long loading times, and bugs again. By all means
6825	0	a	For now im going for not recommended because the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game forces you to create a profile on another site WHERE !!! You cant even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing register !!!!!! So i havent even got to the stupid game :((((
10006	0	a	game is dead wont even let you sign up to play it
5683	0	a	...
8483	0	a	terrible game not worth even for free
1688	1	a	Fun game. Lots of hackers. Pay to win.
2969	1	a	You could have a better singleplayer experience from Saints Row (for the similar art and customization) or GTA (for the game type). This game is far from being perfect, and G1 is basically the 4th reich. But it gives me my fill till the HD rerelease of GTA V. But back to the point. APB is awesome, fun gameplay, they just upgraded(?) their anti-cheat and cheaters have been getting kicked like an mma fighter. Graphics are acceptable for how cartoony they are, servers could be better. I get a ridicoulous amount of lag sometimes or none at all other times. Also its not Pay-to-Win, which I love any game that is like that.   tl;dr  Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Customization 10/10 Community 5/10 Servers 5/10   Overall 7.5/10
254	1	a	It is good
10398	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
4579	0	a	I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2943	1	a	Okay here's the scoop on this one. Its a great game, annoying, unfair and sometimes downright infuriating, but GREAT! The customization alone should attract you, but there are problems. The balance system is sometimes just strait up unfair as hell. It'll pit you by yourself against 3 other players while you alone attempt to capture an objective. The weapon balance is a MAJOR issue as well, most of the weapons they have in this game dont act like they should in real life, sometimes you can unload on a high player character and while your steadily putting shots into him he still has enough power to tun around and kill you with 2 bullets.  All and all this is a great game, just make sure you have a microphone to coordinate attacks and you'll do great!
1301	1	a	I have been playing this game for a very long time now. It is fast paced, open world and really fun. The character customization is amazing, and makes the game so much more fun. I play on both teams, enforcer and criminal. They both got their pro's and con's but they both have their own playstyle to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes openworld RPG kind of games.
2482	1	a	An entertaining rage game, I find. Taps into very strong team playing skills when versing strong or large teams. Some missions might have the same objectives but will never play out the same way, the wide range of guns and play styles insures that no 'camp spot' is impossible to defeat. Orgainzation and teamwork can win any fight, you just need to be more orgainzed and strong team then the opposition. Even with team mates the occational hacker can make the game tiring. Can also be demanding on older computers as I recently fixed! XD
2880	1	a	It never seemed to run on my computer but I have always wanted to play it. I am undecided but it would mosst likely be a positive.
412	1	a	Great game, dont know why everyone gives it thumbs down? me and my mate downloaded the game played it for 4 hours and loved every minute, personally i would reccomend being a cop :) 
7905	0	a	Excuse my last one but now, I hate this now... It used to be great fun. Bought a Shotgun, a crappy auto shotgun. Won a few scraps. Earned enough money to bid money for a well created Cerberus Jacket. Got a Robo-Cop kill theme. Watched a few people role-play. Had fun in general.  But now, now it's all gone down in a spiral. I used loved to play this game, the customisation, the role-playing from time to time. In truth, I really, really, really dislike (absolutely hate) this game. But the reason why I play it? I play it in hopes that it will be back the way it used to be.
9425	1	a	this game is cool
4567	0	a	I would recommend you don't start playing this game in the first place. It has so many issues that never get resolved. They release the same thing over and over. Unfortunately I made the mistake and started playing it 3 years ago, now I am hooked. It's like an abusive relationship, you get tired of it and leave for a little bit, but end up coming back for more.
8588	0	a	This game is unique and addictive. It's like GTA, just that it has smaller maps. The gameplay is a lot batter and the customization is epic. Back when it came out i would recommend this game, but not anymore. I am not saying that all the things GamersFirst did were bad, but a lot of them were. Now let's go to the sad part. It has unbalanced missions and weapons, bad spawns, matchmaking, community and it contains lot's of bugs, that are not getting fixed. Marketplace is too expensive, the servers are unstable and are sometimes being ddosed. When that happens the ms jumps over 150, makes it unplayable. They are not adding any new stuff to the game that they promised long ago (like new contacts, free content) nor are they listening to community wishes. The engine upgrade has been in making for eva and they keep postponing the date of its release!  The game has been in a really bad shape for a long time and considering what have we the community seen so far, there is no chance it will get any better anytime soon, maybe never who knows....
9236	1	a	When it was pay to play i made free accounts (a lot of them), and i enjoyed it but in the end i did pay for the subscriptions. played it like crazy for the first 4-5 months but then got borde of it. but i do go back to it every now and then for a bit. good character builds to mess around with, nice landscaping and graphics but the character animations are not 100%
3785	0	a	got false ban reason falls in category of 'hack'? Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  unethical FF bans&nbsp;
1099	1	a	Grab ur friends and play as criminals or enforcers.
7290	0	a	Quite sucks can't even shoot the window lol &gt;.&lt;
8941	1	a	This game has a huge map, hundreds of different weapons, armors, and enemies, there aren't many people that are on, but its an old as â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, everyone in the community knows each other well, sure you can't really do pvp at lower levels, since most people are at the max level, there is a market for buying items with real money, but these are mostly things to make you go through the game faster or vanity, most of the community is very helpful and will randomly give out expensive items that you can sell and make money off of like I did, skill leveling is based on getting exp by crafting and killing, then you put skill points into a skill, mutation or attribute, attributes raise caps on mutations and skills, attribute caps are raised with leveling. Crafting is done with the tradeskills, which are raised by crafting/harvesting. I could go on, but itd be a 10 page document, so I won't
6288	0	a	nah not my kind of game
8355	0	a	Great game, lots of hours on it, yes I did pay a bit which was totally worth it-not to win with paids guns, in fact it was other stuff which doesnt matter, but 2 years ago I randomly got banned. I know more than half of the people who say 'got banned for no reason' are just mad for getting legit banned, but one common sense I would add to my ban argument is the fact that I paid enough money to be smart and not cheat knowing I would get banned sooner or later. Used to by 10/10, 0/10 now..
4592	0	a	this game got annoying just to download.some stuff i dont get why we need it.plus when i played it it got boring so fast
4259	0	a	Are the massive lag issues fixed yet?No?Are the ingame prices fixed yet?No?Is the game any better?A bit?Oh my...
6196	0	a	this game has a lot of potential, sadly the developers are too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together and instead of fixing broken things just release more cashshop crap to get money.  cashgrab/10 would not recommend even to my mortal enemy.
6559	0	a	This game did certainly look good at first, and I love police sims, though there sadly are not a lot of them around. I enjoyed this for a little bit, but soon it began to get boring and repetitive, and this is primarily pay to play. Therefore, I would not recommend this game, because it isn't worth it to pay for some crap in quite a horrible game. Don't play this game. It will waste your time.
1218	1	a	I highly suggest not playing this game,unless you can get by all of the bull it has to screw with your comp you may have a fun time playing it,otherwise prepare for a trudge through some serious trouble
194	1	a	A periodically over-the-top aggressive game but otherwise quite fun. It's a little hard to compare it to other games as for its mechanics in depth are quite diverse. Driving is sort of weird and could be compared to ice skating. Shooting in-game is pretty fun but yet again, hard to compare it to another game. Graphics are a bit out of date but hey, this game was made a while ago. Its freeroam and mission based PvP servers are nice while having servers with open PvP have their perks too  Unfortunately this is one of those P2P or P2W kind of games but its really fun gameplay no matter if you pay money or not.  All in all, I would suggest this game to anyway who likes choosing what side of the law they want to help (by help I mean shooting at people your told to shoot at.)
7579	0	a	This game has a great concept but poor impimentation. The driving is buggy, the servers constantly lag, and there isn't much of a tutorial. Missions are fun, but there's no real progression that reels you in. The only progression you have is upgrading your gear so you can earn more money so you can upgrade your gear (sounds quite Runescape-esque to me). In any case, this game can be fun with a few friends and in limited doses. 6/10.
4916	0	a	Very laggy not worth trying it... Also maid my laptop frezz and gave it bugs
10802	1	a	this is the best game i played in ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3073	1	a	great , love it
7644	0	a	I think i'll give you a thumbs up if you could balanced that ranking system.. like seriously i'm only rank 50, fighting against rank 255 with full modded weapons and vehicles and an instant death grenade launcher / OSMAW.. this is seriously stupid and i've lost interest in it.. threat system is stupid and not balanced.. the high ranked player 195++ will easily owned Gold with just a normal weapon without character modifications at all.. absurd and stupid..
1825	1	a	it more like a cop and robbers type game 
9611	0	a	i have created almost 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing accounts and each and everyone of them are not 'valid' to play the game i waited over and hour for it to download for the game just to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t me? these are the type of people who need to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and get banned from making games
6317	0	a	A Pile of S***. Hated every second of it. Tried to like it but no chance. 0/10  The Machanics for driving isn't good, players are also idots as they a) lag, b) crash into you during missions causing you to loose.  Could do better
5199	0	a	Ugh, so i played this game in 2014 and had around 600+ hrs.. I saw mostly positive review's on the game thought it got better or something, downloaded it, and reminded myself why i removed it from my pc in the first place. ------------------ Game: ------------------ Graphics - Good. Character Customization - Probably the best i've seen. Physics - Bad Car Handling - Fine  ------------------ Is this Game P2W,  ------------------ Yes this game is p2w probably the worst p2w game you will see on the market, people with just a little bit of experience and some money on their mom's credit card will top frag anytime.   ------------------ For those who wan't to buy DLC's or such: ------------------ Don't download anything, the game has too many cheaters its just not worth the money! The game concept is made that you have to buy at least 5 types of weapons to actually be good at the game, having premium gives you at least 3x advantage.  ------------------ For those who say the game is not p2w. ------------------ Many people that leave positive review on the game bought ig weapons and dlc's the players constantly claim that the game is not p2w even though it gives you way more advantage. The game is not skillbased game if you are best player in APB and playing aginst a enemy that is decent with a p2w weapon he will kill you 1000%.   DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! YOU WILL GET ADDICTED AND GO TO THE PART WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY AGINST P2W PLAYERS. JUST NOT WORTH IT! NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!!!

APB is broken, G1 doesnt care about the players, they will go out of there to shut ppl up the talk about all the hackers in this game. they even banned me from the steam forums and they didnt even give a ressean why. lol hell the game is now a lagy POS and full of teleport hacks now  full free to watch this video its shows what im talking about.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3eipeu

1155	1	a	P2W Buy lmg from there store to win
938	1	a	Only after 800 hours of this game do i truly know the nature of this game, the grind is real however p2w is existant and a bitter community drag down the overall experience. There is a faulty match making system which can pit 1000 hour veterans towards new recuits starting the game. Nudity and overall sexuality is overwhelmingy evident throughout the game, Social District being a prime example. Despite the games countless downfalls such as consistent lag spikes, the game reaches a level of customization that is not matched by other games. The total verdict of this game is 10/10 would recommend Fak you give me money.
7390	0	a	This game sucks. The only way to get anywhere is to pay money for premuim. there is also to many hackers.
7463	0	a	Not great in my personal opinion. Hard to drive and when I went on I couldn't find anyone else. It's free, but there isn't any other reason than that why I would play this. And consequently, I dont.
2934	1	a	Fun if you have friends to play with
1162	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
6863	0	a	The game seemed pretty decent right off the bat. Then I played a little longer and realized, it is a rushed piece of crap that should have never been released. It has potential however thats like saying Michael Jordan had potential at baseball BS he sucked at baseball. The game could have been something much better. All I am saying is that if it hadn't been rushed and it had a little bit more put into it, is that it would be a great GTA alternative or at least that's what I think             Sincerely, AnTixRushed
4997	0	a	Big waste of hard drive space, time, and money. It is boring and has TERRIBLE gameplay mechanics.   Do not download!
4943	0	a	The phtos and videos you see make it look a lot better than it really is, and what would make this game better would be: You dont loose all your money when you die, no noobs, no spawn killing, no pros in the recruit area, more cops, less criminals, less competiotion, rid of team betrayal when you're not ready and most of all clothes. Like, who wants to mug 48 people for a plain hat? COME ON! If you die once, you start again. Horrid game. If all this was changed, i'd re-install it... but nobody ever reads these things.
2918	1	a	Tis game iz lik GTA Saints Row Call of Dutes and Random crap fun, Get it :D (p.s. if you are, go to Colby SW Server)
2596	1	a	It's a bit laggy but its fun.

6180	0	a	so i think i'v played this game enough to give it a quick review (1250 hours if you wondering) so lets get started  i started to play this game about 3 years ago and it was fun (it is too now but not as it was back in a day) and then gamers first came in... they pretty much killed all the game potential...  i DO NOT recommend this game (play it at your own risk, i warned you) IF u have not played it before, why you probably ask, let me tell you why:  1. the community is toxic (do not even test it) 2. heavily P2W (put into this game 300$, and i 100% regret it) 3. this game updated 1 time in a year, and when they do update it, its a new P2W weapon 4. the engine in this game absolute crap (not even to mention that they soppused to upgrade the engine in 2013, they didnot even got it out after 3 years) 5. the physics are..... physics (witch mean they absolutely stupid, you've never seen this stupid, belive me) 6. the real cash items prieces are stupidly high ( lets say you want to put into this game 30$ witch is nice amount, you get only 2500G1C witch is the real cash game credits and you cannot even buy with that a simple bundle, you get the idea)  the only thing that i do recommend and i do like and want to be in other games is the design and the costumization level that this game have. so if you want to try this game for the game play, like i said its not recommended but if you want to try it for the costumization, i say so ahead. so the thing that i do recommend is below:  1. you can pretty much costumize everything in this game (due to the P2W level you got a limit for that and you need to buy premium if you wanna do really nice stuff) that inclodes: cars, clothes, kill theme (everytime you kill some it plays a music that you put) symbols 2. there is a ingame marketplace that the player can sell pretty much everything to other players  so, if you planning to play this game alone and you really want to who i am to say no to you but its not recommended, if you have NOT played this game before, i do not even recommend that you even download this game (unless you coming for the design things) if you does not planning putting any money into this game (witch you should not even think of because its completely waste of money) i do not recommed because you cannot really do much without a premuim and other suff that you have to buy with real cash, and lets not talk about the MM in this game (belive me its the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest MM out there)   so pretty much if you not planning about wasting all your money into this game and you like crap MM, toxic community, hardcore P2W game style and you didnot played it in the past, DO NOT EVEN THING of even trying it out its completely waste of time (and i know i keep saying this but this game is crap).  overall game expirence 3/10 - could be 10/10 with a better company behind this game
2029	1	a	I just wish they make it more good game
2270	1	a	A Free Grand Theft auto like game were you can be a Cop or a Crim I recormend it for GTA Fans
2936	1	a	DUDE YOU GOT TO FIX THIS I CANT EVEN PLAY
1371	1	a	well, the first thing i can say is the best game ever! :D (for me, at least)  APB is a pretty good game, i could recommend it to anyone, but lets see the things in it that are good and/or bad  the good things in APB: +great character customization! +great vehicle customization! +great designing/designs +great gameplay! +great graphics!  the bad things in APB: -difficult for new players (bad matchmaking :( ) -some possible 'pay to win' weapons to buy for real money -a little bad optimization -very bad community (toxic community :| :x) -cheaters  about the community, there are still a few nice people to meet, but not much.. most of the players are a**holes on APB, but dont give your hopes up! ^^ overall, i think its a really good game, its worth to try it and play it!

6693	0	a	Not really good, the game just throws you in with no explanation of what to do. Everyone is running around with p2w weapons which can one shot you, your start weapons are absolute useless shot my whole magazine in guy and he didnt even flinch.Also the grenade spam is preposterous everytime you come near a objective you are greeted by thousands of grenades... Loading times are waaay too long which is strange considering that the graphic arent that great. All in all I didnt had a good time also the community are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
7059	0	a	tried to start launcher and it crashed(win10)  10/10 would crash again
6816	0	a	The loading screen is better than the game... It's another ''free to play'' game. But there are of course all of those people who really like to pay for this stupid game. I don't even think if I should really call it a game. It is like modern art... You pay a lot of money, but it is still nothing.
3337	1	a	Has lots of problems, mostly created by G1. Fun though. Lots of potential.
3749	0	a	After having played this game for 3 years and put over 1000 hours into it. I can say for certain that this game is a fundamentally flawed broken unfinished piece of sh!t, no one wants to play this game and FOR A GOOD REASON.  Apb has a huge potential to be something great, It has the hands down best customization any game ever made has to offer. You can create your own cars and clothing and truely be anything you want to be with little limitation. But on the gameplay side of things, while the the idea behind the gameplay and the missions and all that stuff is solid, the fundamental design flaws prevents it from living up to that potential. On top of that, the game is littered with many bugs, imbalances and, serious client side and crippling server side performance issues. And most importantly, this game attracts and empowers a lot of duchebags to do maximum duchebaggery, they are like the soul of APB (and not in a good way)  So what are these fundamental game design flaws?  Map designs that do not take into account what this game is about and how it is played, players love exploiting the flawed map designs to cheat the mission by placing items on high up unreachable places and obstructing or destroying the only way to get there, making the whole mission invalid and granting them an automatic win. Or putting the item in a car and circumvent the speed penalty for doing so by just pushing the car with another car and driving on the part of the map that is impossible to intercept.  Mission designs that give no consideration to the locations or nonsensical objectives that dont take into consideration the nature of the game. For example, investigating an ATM in a middle of an open 80-150m space with no cover and surrounded by sniping positions. Or pointless objectives that are impossible for one of the teams to do, like stopping a car from going through 3 unspecified checkpoints on random locations on the map. Some mission objectives are placed in locations that greatly favor one of the teams.   Almost all missions in this game require you to camp the objective, the whole game is based on camping and some combinations of map locations and mission objectives make it impossible to finish some missions because the enemy team is camping some roof top that has only one way up with guns pointed at it and is too high to be sniped.  Theres also weapons that dont belong in this game, Such as the OSMAW rocket launcher that makes any semblance of a balance in this game, hit rock bottom.  No one will ever fight fair, they will use every dirty trick in the book, any given opportunity to cheat the mission and will have no mercy for your rank 25 noob as.s.  They will be rude and obnoxious about it, they will message you without provocation just to insult you during or after the mission when they won it. The forum community is just as rotten.  I also have to mention the broken matchmaking that throws low level beginner players against high level duchebags that have unlocked every possible balance breaking gear and know every possible game exploit and are not ashamed to use all that to stomp the low level new players that dont have jack sh!t unlocked. The more game breaking gear is, the higher level locked it is, making sure that people who dont need it to win the mission have it and people who could really use it dont, witch tips the scales to a 90 angle between both sides.   If you have no job and live in your mom's basement, even you will find this game to be the biggest grind fest ever conceived, if you do not have a sh!t bucket nearby, this game is not for you. Even with premium, be prepared to put at least 400 hours to get on a level playing field with the rest of the players or your as.s will be stomped every mission you do. You will get 90% grind and 10% actual enjoyment before you get to a point where you have all the necessary gear unlocked and can start playing the game just for fun.  If all of this wasnt enough, G1' is 'working hard' to add all kinds of new and exciting ways to be an as.shole in the game. Such as the 'car surfer' character mod that allows your character to ride on top of a car and fire any bul.lsh!t weapon you want at your opposition who is chasing you and blowing up their car, eliminating every little remaining chance for the enemy team to get their hands on that item you are running away with like a pus.sy instead of fighting, throwing out the last remaining bit of fairness and balance out the window and ensuring the victory for your team.  A car surfing OSMAW as.shole on top of a car with other cowboy hat duchebags is like a cherry on top of a stinking sh!t cake. It is the symbol of everything that is wrong with this game.  i also forgot to mention, the gun play is a joke, there is no proper bullet collisions with map objects, making you hit invisible forcefields and random objects you arent even aiming at, your weapons lock up and dont shoot if you pressed shoot a tiny bit too soon after you finished climbing a ladder or getting out of the car. There is no such thing as hitboxes for body parts or headshots or any of that modern stuff, the whole player is one big hitbox (usualy bigger than the player model so they can kill you without even touching you. The servers run on a 40ms (ideal conditions - also never) tick rate that effects the gun play, and other aspects of the game. This means things only happen every 40ms, you can feel this delay the most when you are driving a car or pressing F to do an action, you can also see the shots you fired at lets say a car, hit it after some delay. This is kind of a problem to the gun play, you get the kill or not depends a lot not on your skill but on factors like if your shots are at the beginning or the end of that 40ms gap, witch is also greatly effected by crippling server side lag issues. It also seems that some people are favored by the server over others, they are so called lag armor users or people that kill you faster than the max fire rate of the weapon they are using. Its different from person to person, i guess the server somehow lines up people in a specific order when it processes information coming from them. There is also a big problem called ghost shots, its when you shoot but for whatever reason the server doesnt register any of your shots.  So yeah, this game is a really good idea, but the execution is terrible, dont waste your time unless you are a masochist like me.  TL;DR  Serious client side performance issues and crippling server side performance and bugs. Maps designed for the wrong game. Missions placed blindly, not taking location consideration or what game this even is. Rude community, especially on the forums. Camping, Using exploits, taking advantage of the fundamental design flaws and other kinds of cheating to win missions. This game is 10% fun and 90% frustrating grind. Balance breaking Weapons that do not belong in this type of game.
4705	0	a	it is an alright sandbox game with what you would expect but it suffers from many of the usual free to play problems evrything is way to grindy some guns are just straight up better than others and in general the gunplay isnt fun i wouldnt reccomend this game unless you had some friends to play with for a little bit 
3611	1	a	it is a pretty good game
5585	0	a	Tutorials are not at all helpful. The matchmaking system is totally non-existant, as a new player i was matched against players who had hundreds of hours of play time consistantly leaving missions with no reward or xp.
1368	1	a	A new gen GTA....well guys give it a shot!
3466	1	a	This game is good. Ive been playing it for 4 years... maybe more I dont know. Most peaople will tell you its about pay2win, but it realy isnt I know it. You just need high skill. You just need strong nerves and some time from start. So I recomend this game because its: open world, perfect customization of character and cars, not many hackers (only no-lifers with super skills) and I hope the upgraded engine for this game will make it better. Also APB is growing every week/month so it never gets bored. Thanks for reading my review.
4089	0	a	this game is dead after new threat system.
9685	0	a	There's a reason it's free to play...

1141	1	a	Good If You Can Run It Sad That I cant my CPU is to low thats all it is why i cant run it
1918	1	a	APB is a very fun place to play, fast cars, guns, and a cops vs theif none stop, gotta watch your back, Played this alot, will play more, been busy lately but look forward to the return of my cars!, I love making awesome cars for you guys!
6796	0	a	Tons of character variety. Fun PvP.  Downside? Falls into the Pay to win category, which just isn't for me.
1885	1	a	Be who you can't be.
4294	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3144	1	a	No, I actually canÂ´t recommend this game to anyone. In the beginning youÂ´ll get kill-farmed by the veterans, the mission design is repetitive and the community is the worst IÂ´ve ever seen. Still, IÂ´ve played almost 450 hours with my two chars, so there has to be something with this game... Enjoy!^^
10581	1	a	there was a acending moment in this game

3394	1	a	The game does have it's flaws but overall it is one of those games where you can troll other people and have a decent time with friends. Like to â¥â¥â¥â¥ people off? Well this is the game for you but warning! Other players are just as good at trolling, even better at times. So eat tacos and let the bodies hit the floor.
9550	0	a	Can't even play the game, too many issues with updating; It keeps reinstalling the same update over and over again so actually launching the game from steam is impossible.
1966	1	a	Great!
5935	0	a	Hi all, this game is so much fun But there are Cheaters that have aim bot, speed run , more heal or infinete heal and gun speed shoot. yeas it fun but anty cheat thes not worck and can even report a cheater in game .
1337	1	a	This is a good alternative game that allows some fun choices in weapons. Not your typical MMO though however as it is more of a FPSMMO w/ max server sizes of 50v50 maps on missions and smaller on quick pvp style deathmatch maps. Progression through Contacts (Mission givers) unlocks differnt guns, vehicles and cosmetic items.
1078	1	a	This game is Heaven for all PvP'ers and MMO players
5043	0	a	iti is rubbish 
2692	1	a	I like this game alot.
8692	0	a	can't get past launcher. not worth the time.
3118	1	a	Great game, when the server isn't lagging or matchmaking is broken or you end up facing a hacker. But the customization is great visuals are cool and combat is fun if you can get used to it and the driving.
10093	1	a	Really Interesting Game, If You And Your Friends Like Kinda Sorta End Of The World Stuff Then You Will Like This Game. Although It Cannot Fully Capture The, 'End Of The World' Feel, Being An MMO And All.
9100	1	a	Awsome game !
1740	1	a	This game is amazingly fun with lots of customization on your character and vehicles, although it can be limited unless you have premium (Subscription). Great third person shooter with a decent community and really loyal. Yeah it's a shooter but the driving around experience is pretty great also even though there are alot of jerks purposely ramming into you lol, but that's some of the fun. You should definately give this game a try.
623	1	a	one of the best games ive ever played but this small community has a big chance to encounter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and 99% trying to be cool with like 20k gametime mlg pro nolife or speedhack and aimbot and all of theese fat virgin â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who will die alone without friends and family destroy the fun of the game the best thing will be that you will never chat with this fgts cuz from over 1000people i see there i just found 4 normal persons and i like them very much ^_^ sad but true :D and for the negative guys who dislike everything i am gold rank and i am the most time mvp without hack l2p mad â¥â¥â¥â¥
1252	1	a	Its ok
1700	1	a	Guns should not be temporary, especially ones bought in DLC Packs  Customization is very lacking for those who dont want to spend 30 bucks on this  Needs more accessible prices, or like atleast a one time fee to unlock the whole game.  6/10 It's repetitive, a bit lacking, and you will find vacant servers, but if you get a friend, it can be fun seeing who is the worst driver.
9171	1	a	Pretty fun, especially since it's free, I haven't played it in ages but I have fond memories of roaming the lands with my friend, we did quests, got loot, pretended to be hobos living in dumpsters, untill we found an empty building and used that as a house, that was pretty fun. For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying â¥â¥â¥â¥, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HUGE HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again. Infact, just writing this review makes me want to go play the game again actually I think I'll do that.
7162	0	a	why my game dont work at all      complaine to steam 
4129	0	a	you thought a crime vs cop game would be fun? TOO BAD â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. yo will get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by everyone, breaking shops gives little to no reward, and you get a bounty usually higher than your gains... new car? spend some days in, you might get one lmao.  this game suffers from a pay to use customisation system, is heavily trying to make you pay for everything, and has a poor optimisation (level 9 players can hunt level 3's who broke shops) not to mention clans, who usually run on beginner tears to level up their members.  you start with crappy weapons which do less damage than a .22LR while looking full-size, you get your dime ten times for everything you try....and there is ninjas everywhere.
2005	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
565	1	a	A lot of fun awaits you in APB if you have a team of friends to play it with. Customization options are incredible. Nothing feels better than putting a naughty tattoo on your body and shock the serious players with it. On the other hand, it is pay2win, stereotypic and matchmaking is sometimes unfair. But I appreciate that anybody can try it for free. 7,5/10  What's there to hate about this review?? :D I wonder.. Tell me in the comment section in stead of monkey clicking the thumb down. I want to know, because I want to improve.
1926	1	a	Got killed within 30 seconds of actual gameplay. 10/10

4483	0	a	Cannot Even Open the Game, too many Massive updates. Download GTA IV, play online and get a massive moneys worth.  And Apparently i have played 60 Hours of this game, i checked the Task Manager and a little APB exe was running which was the cause of this.  Not worth a single MB.
8305	0	a	Matches people who have been playing the game for a few minutes against those who have been playing for hundreds of hours. Matchmaking is the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ thing I've ever seen, good luck getting matched against people you might actually be able to beat.

8199	0	a	Until this became 'pay to win' it was a very enjoyable game. I spent many hours with friends running down cons in our pimped out squad cars. I was happy to pay the minor monthly fee back then for that bit of near hackerless fun and no PTW store. I noticed a lot of 'features' cost $ that before the changeover didn't, a way to make an extra buck for the devs I guess.
1910	1	a	think third person fps with small teams against one another. good for a free to play but does have a pay to win setup TONS of customization. 8/10 in my book 
4624	0	a	wtf this dis â¥â¥â¥â¥ bruh bug's and bug's i have BEST Pc and this game laging...... i think...it's need help this game send help
242	1	a	Truely my favourite game, is pay to win and by that I mean that if you buy stuff for the game you have an advantage over the free to plays. In my own opinion this is better than GTA as this has much more play time and effort and customization. If I'm bored, I play APB. If I'm tired, frustrated or just feel like having fun I play APB. I LOVE APB.
2277	1	a	  its a good game but we need a motorbike and a bus and a plane and a tank and a aircarft
3486	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
2895	1	a	THIS MIGHT BE ALRIGHT
10399	1	a	Best first person/ third person mmorpg action pact awesomeness that you will find on the net. Pvp game play is real fun and the crafting system is one of the most complex i have ever seen check it out.
7647	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
3841	0	a	I really can't believe I tortured myself with this game for so long.  I immediately fell in love with the idea of the game. Who among us, who grew up in the GTA generation, could refuse a massively multiplayer simulacron? A game where you could run rampant in a bustling city, breaking the law or thwarting lawbreakers. A game where you could make your own theme music, graffiti and design your cars and clothes. A game with a thriving community-driven marketplace.  It wasn't hard to crush those dreams, as the current developers and community have done. The game makes you hate each other. It makes you hate the people hosting and developing it. Matchmaking forces you to discriminate against weaker players being on your squad. Mission types devolve into hateful grudge matches that will make you twitch, sweat, and curse. The low population and broken ranking system will ensure that certain notorious individuals will become your personal arch nemeses. The laughable price point at which gear is pushed by the marketting department will have you cringing. The way in-game money makes people insane will have you questioning your own friends' intentions and paranoia will haunt your every financial decision. The balancing of weapons, and the steep skill landscape will ensure that every now and then your weapon, no matter how spectacular or expensive, will feel like a capgun or limp noodle in your hand.  It took me far too long to realize I wasn't even enjoying myself. I hope this, and other reviews like it, may yet spare someone of the same experience. Oh yes, my love and I spent well into a hundred or so dollars each on this game. It's definitely not even worth trying as a free-to-player. You're severely limitted in every aspect of gameplay unless you're a premium account holder.
9242	1	a	Multiplayer Fallout!
3436	1	a	I cant get in from this game 
10777	1	a	I was playing the game, SUPER FUN, and later it kept yelling at me that i had to run it in steam, which i was. i dont know why it started, or how to fix it. I do recommend the game in hopes this doesnt happen to you
2562	1	a	Its rediculously fun
3218	1	a	When you are playing alone you will suffer in agony so get a friend. Then you both can suffer.  10/10 best heroin simulator
2377	1	a	The best Online game in the free for all class !!!!! its hours of fun :D !
494	1	a	Great game. You should try it :3
5193	0	a	Its boring theres nothing to do exept walk around and shoot random crap 
8541	0	a	This is by far the worst community I've experienced in twenty years of gaming. This game attracts the lowest common denominator of every other game. Beyond the community, it's barely functional and runs horribly even on great machines. The engine update was promised for Q1 2014, yet it still hasn't happened. It can be fun at times, and it is a great idea for a game. However, the execution is extremely poor. I would not recommend this one.
502	1	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1471	1	a	its a berry good game and its free.
1764	1	a	great for when you want a cause of suicide!
1004	1	a	dont know but when i download it, it says its done but ALWAYS stops installing at 5-20 seconds left
3010	1	a	One of those Free Games that you Don't want to miss out, And Btw, don't hesitate to buy premium definitely worth it. Goodluck my Fellow APB Players. If you are a Enforcer, prepare to get pwned.
2609	1	a	how do i staert it 
6613	0	a	It is almost impossible to kill someone with the first level guns, It takes 30 hits from the 1st rifle in the game to kill someone. Then you get blown away with shotguns and more powerful weapons. This is a pay to win game. I played for a day, and it was mostly dying.....
8113	0	a	WAAAAY back in the day I was picked to alpha test this game. The entire community of testers told the Devs time and again that they needed to add things to APB other than pure PvP for the game to work. Unfortunately, they never listened to their potential customers, the game did terribly, and the original devs ended up closing shop because of it! Now that it's been out for a while on the F2P market I figured I would give it a try, to see if the game has matured into something other than what it used to be. Sadly, nothing has been changed. The same glitches are in the game, and even with a &lt;60 ping latency the server still bugs out when there's a lot of people in one place.   If all you're interested in is running and gunning against other players then have at it, otherwise I would recommend other games like The Secret World that are on the F2P market.
6622	0	a	Has potential, but when you can't even leave the tutorial because the enemy team all have pay-to-win rocket launchers the game is unplayable. Stay away unless you feel like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ out untold amounts of money just to exit the tutorial.
10387	1	a	It takes a while to update, but it's worth every second of waiting.
4615	0	a	Nice idea totally broken by a horrible matchmaking, which ends making matches between fresh new players that are learning how to play with endgame players (makes totally no sense). Also, as usual in every 'Free To Play Games' theres a 'Pay To Win Option' that makes you premium and get the good weapons to win all matches easily.  Most weapons AREN'T permanent, they last around 10 days max. The game constantly lag's out, and bugs are frequent. Specially when you're shooting.  The protection against hackers is horrible, as I have seen people using Pistols from long range like if they were using a sniper (reminding that theres not a zoom option, or a very very poor one), I've also seen people using Heavy Rifles with the accuracy of a sniper, which is highly improbable.  Do not recommend, waste your time elsewhere :)    
3930	0	a	Me: ggwp A player on the enemy team: stfu â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥  This game is worse than cancer
1908	1	a	I recommend this game to a rather limited crowd, for a couple of reasons.  _Pros_  Customisation. Probably the best I've ever seen in a game, better than Saints Row, better than the Bethesda games for character customisation. You can make your character look like pretty much anyone you choose to, let alone the great symbol customiser and car customisation is brilliant. Except the lack of non-purchased car parts, GamersFirst loves the moneys.  _Cons_  Level design is attorcious, you can lock down an entire mission for an opposing team by camping in a completely unreachable spot. San Paro is plagued by badly designed, unconquerable locations, which players can move the objective too, and will make people mash their head on the keyboard, and hang themselves on power leads with fustration. - For example, there's a mission where you have to defend a briefcase, and a team put it on a ledge, which no-one could get to as it was so over-exposed that they could be shot from 360Â° Horrific.  Repitition. Gaaaah, this game is full of it. Most of the missions repeat themselves over and over again, the same mission, but in slightly different locations. This is fine for the first 10 hours, but after that you're seeing same old, same old over and over again. Nothing really changes as you sit there enduring the couple of minute wait between missions.  Community. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥, packed with hackers, and accusations of being a hacker. You'll rarely meet someone who's actually friendly, just people that are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off by you being utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥ and decreasing their status from Gold to Silver.  _Conclusion_  It's good for people that love customisation and shooting at things and driving, and that's pretty much it. I just happen to be one of that few that doesn't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the cons.
8535	0	a	Crashes to much as soon as I get in game  
2629	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
8124	0	a	-10/10
8752	0	a	Customization in this game is incredible, sadly hackers have destroyed any will to play. Was one of my favorite shooters.
2302	1	a	i have real big mixed opineons with this game imm not going to lie. but heres something they need to tweak: dont make it p2w, make gold players go to gold servers (same with silver and bronze) but other than thoes 2 things its a real solid game 7/10
8509	0	a	Just a load of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
4210	0	a	What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load. Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up. I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.
7100	0	a	i you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ kidding me wow i got blocked for some reason and i didnt do anything that break to policy wow i dont recommend you wasting you time on this
9280	0	a	The game is completely unplayable on a brand new laptop. It freezes, crashes,and if it does run, it does nothing but give the equivlent of what WoW would be on dial up, if that.
4306	0	a	Played it for a little bit.  Didn't care for it very much.
7838	0	a	if you are from egypt dont download this game because there is no world is near t you so you cannot play you will just be able to custom a characters
7652	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
6543	0	a	The idea of cops versus robbers is an exicting new idea with it having so much potential. APB Reloaded delivers a new and chaotic idea of the dangerous streets of the city of San Paro.  - If your most intrigued by story-line based First Person Shooters, APB Reloaded is not for you. The story is a linear of 'Criminals are causing harm to the city, choose to protect the city or be against it.'  + The customiztion is where this game shines. Most likely, your character won't look like the next persons, with complex and advanced yet simplistic character customization your able to really stand out of the crowd. To the colors of your bandana to the acne and scars on your face, this is the only one reason I always seem to crawl back to this game. Spending hours apon hours can give such a rewarding feel when you remarkably created your very own first ever unique character. Your character is not just the only thing you could customize, the rims on your car, the hood of your car, you could even add a little jingle that your foes will be forced to listen to time and time again when you defeat them.  - A major problem I've encountered during the many hours I've pumped into this game is that the overall gameplay is awful. Huge pay to win aspects floating around every direction you go, match making couldn't ever seem to match me with a suitable ranking, and overall was just a frustrating experience. When I would buy an upgraded Sniper Rifle to counter the other Snipers, I would be picked off in one shot by one across the map, which was purchased with real money. Or if I were to buy any rifle, would get RPG'd with the only warning being that distant beeping noise right before the missle is launched. It keeps you cussing and always feels like your at a disadvantage if you haven't put any money into the game. The city feels rather dull and has a bland approach, and the civilians feel artificially made with no effort put into them besides the modelling and possibly voice acting.  - You can't have a non-gaming computer and be able to play this game. It's rediciously CPU intensive and requires powerful graphics cards to run at High settings with 60+ fps. (From what I remember)  All and all the game brings many laughs while playing with friends for a short while, but I would never consider playing this alone for long periods of time.
9435	0	a	Weird movement mechanics
9095	1	a	This game is unique, and the best FREE MMO Post Apocalyptic Game there is in my opinion.  What can you do in it ?: well alot of things. you have a huge in game map to go where ever you want and explore and not Just one map but a bunch of them. it is A PvE And PvP game so you wont lack any action of killing other people and ofc Those that feel blood is not for them got nothing to be scared off they can just stay away of the PvP area's You can Craft Alot of things ! (Alot of em) from small things such as ammo and up too cars and horses or wapons. you wont get bored Trust me on that. And now for the part that makes it Stand out from the rest of the MMO games is that it got an incredible Stable currency at the Aucation unlike any other MMO's wich there currency at market places/Aucation houses is Ridiculous To say the least. this game is perfect for people who look for that Apocalyptic game in wich they free to do What they want and go where they want (its best to play with friends) there are factions wich fight each other over Points of control on the map Did i say that this game is not a Pay To Win Game ?! Hell yeah you dont have to pay money Just to be able to even have a chance vs someone who did pay for the dlc for an example (Winterfall) to all of those who Say it is too hard to get chips in the game (the in game money) all you have to do is go to the Aucation house see what is In high demand and figure out the best way to get it and sell it after you do that a few times you can go to just Buy at low Cost and sell at higher prise to make profit* (My Tip is for free ^_^ ).  Now it is true that this game is not as popular as it was a few years ago and in my opinion it is sad and pity. for such a Game to go to waste because of people crying about how hard it is or complain about some small bugs well i have news For you there are no games with no bugs. we are all humans and we make mistakes and im sure that even now there Team is working hard to fix them all. And since its a FREE TO PLAY GAME i dont think anyone got the right to criticize the Team for being lazy for maintaining a FREE TO PLAY game.
3966	0	a	This game, is an ok game to be free to play, good weapons, outfits, vehicles, missions, all of that is good. But I have to say, this game is just too overated.
153	1	a	Wow. This game is awesome. If you aren't aloud to play GTA, go to this.
4858	0	a	Dare devs, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you... this game was awsome, i stoped for a bit because of work, and i come back and i start it up, and after teh update guess what i get. Instead of it runnig like it did, it says my video card is not compatible. Even though it wroked fine 2 months ago. again â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 
9561	0	a	Absolute trash.
8504	0	a	ugggghhh if you dont wanna pay to win its really not worth playing this laggy game
6115	0	a	I give it 6.5 outa 10 over all its sort of fun but not really :/
3202	1	a	It's a good game.
3924	0	a	APB... was a great idea and game when it came out but at this point 5/4/2014 this game is competey other â¥â¥â¥â¥, your better off playing some thing else. every thing this game had is gone, any game gamefist takes over turns to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i dont think most ppl will read this but it is NOT worth the download. however it was before gamer fist got it and are milkin it, they do the less work as they can possable to do to keep ppl buging...thats all they do, there has been really NO no content since the game started... 4 or so years later... same game, alot more unstable, alot less ppl...
4793	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.
2649	1	a	Good game lots of hacker
6274	0	a	i realy dont know its fun but not fun why not just get gta 5?
4205	0	a	This game is piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥   1.Hackers 2.Bad grafic 3.after 11 Hours it`S boring 4.to expensiveweapons (i payed for ATAC 34,00â¬ = 45 USD) 5.Banned without reson (179r ,Gold rank, a lot of money, weapon for 34â¬, 170Hours) . 6.Ban is able at any program the Gamersfirst doesn`t know.  Don`t play this Game you just frustrated because the pro`S(Hackers) the never get ban. when you play it a long time u are a kind forced to buy for money (cars,weapons,kits and much more).
10703	1	a	A graphically appealing sequel to the Tribes franchise. Gameplay is top notch but still not as great as Tribes 2. PLAY IT!
5805	0	a	This game WAS worth consider playing, with gta-like elements and Wide range of customizations from clothing to vehicles and death themes and more .....but the pvp matchmaking is terrible AND with the type of weapons the devs allowed has made the type of 'fair game' disappeared. If you want to play this game with a much enjoyable mood then buying certain things from the game is recommended...I play it only if i have no games left to play.
5435	0	a	Good game but horrific lag if your'e trying to play from AUSTRALIA. unable to drive with so much lag and you dont stand a chance too much LAGGGGGGGGGG
2363	1	a	If you like playing GTA with forgeign, children, and hackers this game is for you!
10119	1	a	this is a great roleplaying game about america after ww3 and i love this game so i recomend it for EVERYONE
4219	0	a	This does not download
5976	0	a	  I've played this game hundreds of hours off Steam, and the only valid reason this would still be a playable game is for the nostalgia. Really, it used to be a great game with an intresting concept, BUT NAH! Let's make it pay-to-win! I wouldn't waste more time on this than I already have.  Matchmaking: You're bronze rating? Cool, we're gonna match you with gold players at lvl 255, sure. And they're not even gold players themselves, they're just some rich kiddos with aimbot.  Updates: Well, tons of updates. Every week a new weapon. Which you have to pay for like 15$ or buy it on the in-game market for 2 million game cash., which you can grind in about 3 months. Without premium, that is. Buy premium and it's in 1.5 months. Boom.  Physics: If San Paro was a real place, it wouldn't really be in our universe. Strange things happen, I tell ya. The vehicle physics are little said funny. There's just so many things you can do with 2 cars, and then there's the Vegas 4x4. It used to be a premium-only car, but then they added a refferal system so if you play with friends you get points, and if you gather enough you can get it for free. That thing is so overpowered, you can literally land on rooftops with it, also add a Nitro 3 mod just for the fun of it :D The character physics can be frustrating sometimes, and the interactive objects like doors and ladders aren't of any good. Hey, this game has something good, at least!  Customization: This is where the real pro of the game is at. They say. But in reality, you can add, umm, a few decals that you can make yourself by using only boring shapes and stuff, and yeah. BUT HEY, BUY PREMIUM AND YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 100 DECALS ON YOUR CAR! Isn't that just great! Well no, it isn't if you don't wanna spend money on this.  Overall, this game is fun for some weeks to mess around with a friend, but otherwise don't waste your time.  AND THE TROLLS, MAN! SO MANY TEAMKILLERS AND NOOBS!
2049	1	a	Crashing evry 10 mins 11/10
2481	1	a	It has major freezing problems
3468	1	a	See, I love this game. It's kinda like a GTA V without homes, and where you get to play on both sides of the law in a city that has abandoned hope.  It that doesnt sound cool idk what is. The matchmaking could be A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BETTER THOUGH. I only recommend because it's fun to play. I only put that in because tha matchmaking is utterly terrible.  Other than that, it's great imo. 
9493	0	a	This game sucks. I can't even play it because my 'new' account won't work.
8745	0	a	EDIT: After having a second account banned for cheating when I was not cheating, one of which was one I had spent money on, I'm going to have to say that since I have now lost a total ~550 hours of time spent on this game, it was an overall negative experience. Such a shame, it could be so fun if there was more community interaction and the customer support at least TRIED to discuss.  This game is great. Best customization I've ever seen in a game. You can have leggings with a hamburger pattern, or a Strawberry Fish tramp stamp.   Don't ask a Sanctum fan about his dark secrets.    Also, it's just about all free, premium just lets you use more at once. The only beef I really have with the customization is the fact that the minimum boob size isn't really all that small.    Flat chest is justice, small boobs are true.     The driving physics can be really wonky, but really funny. For example, flipping when you clip the ~2 inch elevated curb, or trying to go in circles and clipping a wall, resulting in your car lying on its side.  Your character and Weapons can all have mod slots, which usually have upsides and downsides, so you don't just have a sniper LMG with no downsides.  The combat is pretty fun. Basically you run around like a maniac while holding/spamming LMB and trying to keep your crosshair on the other guy. It's more fun than it sounds, trust me. I also notice almost no latency issues such as you being shot just after going behind cover.  Now, something important to note is that this game WILL make you angry. To properly enjoy it, you have to be able to deal with getting stomped. And stomped again. And again. But after the dust and tears clear, you'll stand up, and find that after hours upon hours of being pounded into the ground, you're now a gold, and beating most of your peers and even a fair few players who outrank you. The stomping doesn't go away forever, and comes back from time to time, and usually when this happens, I get quite worked up, but I just play some other game for a while. It probably helps that I have a bit of a masochistic side to me, but I ALWAYS find myself coming back. It might be a couple hours, it might be a day, it might be a week, once it was even months. I was just playing other games, mostly Planetside 2 and Dota 2, I had decided that G1 was nothing but a money grubbing game killing company that barely moved the development along at all.  Then one day I decided, 'Hey, maybe I'll check out the APB forums. It's not like I have anything better to do.' I don't really have a habit of browsing the forums, but I found a thread that compiled codes for free items and premium. Seeing the headphones code, I realized the immense customization this game had, and thought about how cool it would be to make myself look like Sweet Autumn in-game. Eh, why not? It's not like I'm losing anything by playing a couple rounds. I had put on three days of free premium off the codes thread, and I realized that everything just felt a lot better. In my time away from APB, thanks to Planetside and Dota, my aim and reaction time had greatly improved, and I won A LOT of matches. And on top of that, I was earning a lot more money thanks to the premium. A few days later I realized that between the thread and a couple of events that gave small amounts of G1C, I had amassed enough G1C to buy a Joker Mystery Box. I figured there was nothing else I'd spend the tiny sum of G1C on, so I tried my luck, hoping I'd get crazy luck and get a legendary weapon. I didn't, but I did get 30 days of premium, which was pretty cool.  I sat back and realized, 'Hey, I'm actually having a lot of fun now, especially with all the improved customization thanks to all this free premium.' Since I loved the carbine weapon type so much, I bought the permanent version (Which had like three sales on it at the time) off of the Armas Marketplace.  Then, there was a guy standing near a spawn point at a mailbox. He turned around and shot me. I fired one shot back. He invited me to his group. I figured 'Why not?' Long story short I now have a cool new friend because he shot me.    Whoops, don't try this in real life, kids. People don't take it so kindly.     You know, for a low-down, money grubbing, game-killing company, G1 does a pretty good job.  Also on the joker server there's a guy named KuvoskiStrauss who sprays up lots of well-done pictures of topless/bikini clad animuu girls. Also he sometimes does cool airplane posters. I like airplanes.
4192	0	a	this game is pay to win system and they can ban you for nothing becouse the banning system is really bad even if u have no cheats or hacks or something else it can ban even if u got another client of this game like i had the russian one where was the russian searvers and ukraine servers too in that time i lounched them both becoues i forgot to turn of the russian client and punkbuster thought that it was some kind of cheat and banned me forever i tryed to ask the support of the gamersfirst but they said no we cant do that so i am saying it is just my opinion that apb is the worst game ever

4425	0	a	it takes forever to load up the game and even then its buggy the anti cheat system doesnt work at all even though they have been doing this for fifteen years and even when there are no cheaters the game crashes and for no reason punkbuster say you have been cheating even when your not .  so all in all i do not reccomend this game because it is cheap and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ gta . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND OR TIME
6854	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
8299	0	a	Dont waste your time on this stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥...
5377	0	a	While it has been like two or three years since I last played, the only thing I can remember is that it had some severe pay to win going on. There were a lot of things you had to pay for actually, if not for that then it would be a really fun, cool game.
2444	1	a	Where do I even start with is game. you got guns. you got hip hop. and you got customization like you wouldnt even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing think possible. this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. you even wanna roll 4 deep with some homies and just shoot up â¥â¥â¥â¥? well in this game you can. need I say more?
2800	1	a	After playing this game for over 120 hours, I've finally realised that it is just a ploy for money. Having said that, I should also bring to light my very many laughs and good times I've had with this game. With the 'missions' and pvp so frustrating, the only redeeming quality of this game is customization. Filled with infinite possibilities, the game is fun, however tiresome and rage inducing. I'll have to give it a 6.5/10
9288	1	a	Apparently I played this for .3 hours some time in the past. I do not remember this. So either something's wrong with Steam, or this game has nothing worth remembering.  I don't even remember how I got to the store page to see that I was able to write this 'review'. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?  Recommended because possible timewarp/10.
1568	1	a	the best free-to-play on steam in my opinion
10221	1	a	alsome game
8099	0	a	Its a pay to win game!!  Was fun at first before they got greedy and now only cheaters and people with credit cards play. AVOID THIS GAME!!
2364	1	a	I just came here to read the comments :o ***
8186	0	a	To many hackers
6646	0	a	Sorry but this is a joke, after many hours of downloading, it installed and started updating which was fine by me, seemed normal, until the update got to 100% and nothing happened, it started saying 'installing Direct X' which i obviously already have. After maybe 20 minutes of confusion i looked around the steam forums, followed some advice, but this time when i clicked play, it bought up the same download window and just started downloading something different. After this it successfully ended, however the game STILL won't play. It either does nothing or says the application is already running (which it isn't.)  Pretty disgraceful, i downloaded Left 4 Dead 2 without a problem and it works fine. APB seems to be severely fukced. I know it's free to play but you still expect it to actually work after the installation progress.   EDIT: Just found out that on this game you have to pay REAL LIFE money for IN GAME guns, games like this should be ended. Money grabbing bull****.  ANOTHER EDIT: So yeah since this i've downoaded many games via Steam, none had any sort of problem what so ever, games i've downloaded and am able to run normally include Rust, Outlast, The Forest, Next Car Game, Battlefield 3, the list goes on, APB goes in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ list with gaming atrocities like Velvet Sundown who wouldn't even run.
1246	1	a	It gives you a true feeling of what it is like to be a cop or criminal
303	1	a	Its a pretty cool game if you look beyond all the technichal issues.
5263	0	a	I would rather swim in a pool of nails and acid while contracting all the STDs in the world with a COD kid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing my mom and having satan repeatedly stab me with a cerated katana that is infested with AIDS. The creators of this game are looking down on the non-pay2win people and get their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles from watching the major â¥â¥â¥â¥ going on. Might as well be able to pay for aimbot and wallhacks while they're at it.
1075	1	a	Like smashing your friends van to steal a boombox? GET ABP RELOADED! Like getting your van stolen by your friend? GET ABP RELOADED! Wanna die? Commit suicide, or GET ABP RELOADED! Like copyrighted cars? GET ABP RELOADED!    Best game ever 666/10

8526	0	a	This game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mach making is horrible so it like one level 3 versus 5 level 200eds. Its very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and im resigning on this game for a long time. Hear that APB im calling â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t!
7470	0	a	getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by punkbuster so for i hate the game , waste of my time not GOOD
6429	0	a	worst game ever i played so far,just got in,got banned,by being new,10/10 would pick up a pistol and shoot Reloaded,took more than 40 mins to download,what was very boring,then i could play 20 minutes (its a disgrace to steam,its the WORST game i've ever played,yes,even out of the bought and free games)
1995	1	a	its nice and cool &lt;3 the cars and stuff i rate the game 20/17 but its ok 
3148	1	a	this is the version of GTA. it is holy fun
9083	0	a	u have to go through sooo many stuff to just play it and its not even fun horible game who ever made this has no idea wat there doing
9020	1	a	this is like a fallout with an mmo aspect. though to be honest there is a bit of leveling needed to go out there and explore. the crafting system wont seem as bad at first(as there are wait times for crafting items),but when you get to atvs and cars, pop a squat and go play fallout on a console for about 6 hours to see if a peice of your car is finished, or just go to bed, either one.  if they console ported this game, i would play it.   #still better than dayz
9307	1	a	I actually purchased this game a long time ago, and played it then, got distracted by some other really good games. But this one is online, and has the perks you get with an online game. Thru Steam it is Free To Play, and I can't seem to get the game to start. Did a file validation, there were 11 files missing. I already have an account with Fallen Earth, so I should be good to go, as soon as I get those 11 missing files. What could have happened? Looking forward to getting started again and I'll update my findings. Yay Steam.

5305	0	a	this game is for â¥â¥â¥â¥boys
7495	0	a	This game has the potential to be awesome but it sucks on so many levels. First off it is a massive grind, you have to invest a substantial amount of time into it to be able to unlock anything at all, even if you pay the monthly fee to increase your rates. On top of that you have a broken weapon system that leaves every weapon with an unrealistic niche forcing you to buy a ton of weapons to be able to fight in different areas of the map otherwise the guy with the weapon better tailored for that alleyway or that elevated highway is going to win regardless of how good he/you are.   The biggest flaw however is the ranking system in this game. It is absolutly impossible to play this game as a new player and have a decent time learning the game because the tiered ranking system apparently plays no role whatsoever in matchmaking. There are servers tiered for each rank on the list, but they are not locked for that rank so someone well beyond your skill level as judged by the game can join your server and will get matched against you in the matchmaking system every... single... game. It just isn't fun getting destroyed mission after mission by female avatars in knee stockings and miniskirts, or flat naked who have hours upon hours more invested in the game to unlock all of the guns and perks and cars and whatever else.   Game sucks, do yourself a favor and go get just cause 2 if you want a freeform driving multiplayer game, or world of warcraft if you want to spend hours of your life doing the same repetative â¥â¥â¥â¥ for hours on end to raise up in level.
8594	0	a	The Devs are bunch of trolls... I'm done with this game. Give us the new Engine as you've promised years ago!! So Not Recommending this trash game. Don't play it... Spent your valuable time to somewhere else guys. You're welcome.
4367	0	a	This game is kinda like GTA, just not as polished, big or open-ended. Or....well okay it's not really like GTA at all, apart from you roam around shooting people and stealing cars. Battles are fought in a series of urban maps between two sides, Enforcers and Criminals.  The game has a really, really good character creation and customization system. You really can do so much, height and weight, facial structure, skin tone, moles and scars and all sorts. Clothes are the same, able eventually to be worn in a multitude of colors, with lots of different styles.  The bad points, IMHO, outweigh the good however. The community on this game is absolutely atrocious. Exploititive, foul-mouthed keyboard gangsters constantly filling the district chat with all manner of nasty comments and what is essentially verbal griefing. I can't really stress how awful this community is.  The second worst feature is the driving and combat. Cars are horribly unwieldy and slip and slide like you're driving on an ice rink. The combat is very annoying, as you -will- be destroyed by bouncing, aimbotting 'veterans' with P2W guns that you simply cannot match unless you want to fork out quite a large amount of money. The gunfights are not fun. They really on having suprise and killing within three seconds, any longer and the hyper accurate, ultra-damage gun wielding other players will kill you with suspicious accuracy.  I don't recommend this game at all. The community is a festering, weeping sore that is hopelessly entrenched, and the gameplay is either clunky or skewed horribly in the favour of pay-to-win veterans who scream gangster hood references over the chat at eachother while aimbotting and hacking the game. Avoid.  Not worth even being free.
9661	0	a	Too many buttons
6655	0	a	Im going to be honest: this didn't even make the mark for my expectations. What i was advertised was a Saints Row-type game with crazy gang wars and awesome gameplay. What i got was a clunky game that put more effort into its amazing character customization than the actual gameplay. It's just all over the place and not even Tobuscus could somehow make it better.
8609	0	a	it's a game pay2win, has a bad optimization. YOUR GAME SUCKS! MAKE KIT FULL FREE TO PLAY AND MAKE IT RUN FASTER AND LOAD FASTER ON LOWER PC!
9585	1	a	zdfggfdgfdgfgdfgdgfd Its purrrrrrfect
9004	1	a	I haven't liked most of Steam's F2P games, but I was pleasently surprised with this one, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great. It's free, so it's not like you've lost anything.
6247	0	a	Dont Waste your time GTAV is better
4497	0	a	Here is what I think. APB Reloaded is a good Game, but I feel that I should both critisize and nit pick a lotta things about this game  One is the SMG charging and the repeditiveness to lose to another player because of the overpower of the SMG's in the game. It is so god awful and OP, It made me stop playing this all together. People would just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sprint at you, boomboom â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. They do it with shotguns even. It's stupid as all â¥â¥â¥â¥, also, the new Argotech ACES R&amp;D III is the most OP weapon in the game, and the most unfair, it directly hits, no need for anything else, no range no nothing. People running around with OSMAW Bazookas and silly Argotech ACES SMGs are cowards and are idiots for buying something for a cheap kill every five seconds.   Two is the Customization, specifically for males. I generally have a Randy Savage-Esque Character, but I want more than a Randy Savage look. I want to see hair that will SURPASS my shoulder/neck. I want to see long where is surpasses the shoulders to even the top half of the Pectoral. I really do not care what the general style of man is, give us that choice please. I have a problem with games that never seem to give a choice about Hair style for men, and just give the more mainstream stylings and as I repeat, absolutely sick of it. I want to see a helluvalot more.  Three is the Car handling, which is GOD AWFUL. Simple, It's so unecessarily hard. Go around a corner, you hit a brick â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall in 12 seconds and then your dead.   Four... The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unbalancing of the 'threat levels'. Bronzies all in one, but goldies and silvers mixed together... this game is way under balanced and stupid. it just is horrifingly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I kept on getting my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me because of the Goldies 'better skills' and there silly pay 2 win cheapo weaponry. This game HEAVILY relies on you having to buy weapons all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time and having them rented out instead of kept which is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb. You basically are vulnerable as a cop or a criminal. Oh but the Enforcers (cops) have all the advantages of quickly getitng everything. Yeah. The Goods It's Free, so if you are looking for a filler game, go ahead, get this It has the Best customization, despite what I say about Male customization. Sometimes, you can win by using simple weaponry and stuff. SOme of the Pay 2 Win items are pretty good if you think about it. Most importantly, it is a co-opish game, so you can play with friends  Overall, If I were to rate tis on a simpler basis, it would be atleast a 5/10 Because of the new crap that G1 and Reloaded added.   Thanks Reloaded, you guys do not know anything about fairness.  Edit: I am putting on the thumbs down, but it's your choice. at this point I am in the middle. ANd the reason there is so much bad is BECAUSE this game has too many rage inducing moments and the
9675	0	a	this game has aids and will give you aids
2725	1	a	GREAT AND LAG SOMETIMES BUT STILL LOVE THE GAME 
5693	0	a	I'd like to start this reveiw by saying that this game has alot of positive things about it, but it's brought down by many other things, for starters, The possibilities for customization is nearly limitless, but unless you pay, you can only use three symbols.'Ok not a problem, I'll just use as many custom symbols as I can!' No. You can only use 25 symbols per custom symbol, unless you pay for premium, you're stuck with this handicap, and they will remind you of this every chance they get.  So you can't make nice clothes, cars, or tattoos, there's still more to the game like mugging, driving, and missions right? Wrong, the premium handicap applies here too, anytime you earn cash from crimes, missions, or arrests, you only get a peice of it, and they remind you how to get that in-game cash (here's a hint, it involves paying a monthly fee). It's not just money they take from you, gaining repution with contacts takes longer too, it's like they think less of you for not paying them to talk to you.  So you've had it, you give in and decide to pay to take off the handicap, which costs 999 G1C, and you can't buy exactly 999 or even 1000 G1C, you can buy 800 ($10) or you can buy 1200 ($15). Well now that you have you're credits, you spend the first 999 on premium, that leaves you with 201, why not spend it on the Armas market? Because the only perament item you can buy, with that much G1C is clothes. Did I forget to mention the weapons you buy in-game, no matter how much you spend will only last 10 days?  Well now you have premium, you can put some pretty cool stuff on you're clothes, or on your car, nope. You get one page of basic shapes to work with, you have to grind and hope for new ones, or buy another page's worth from the Armas market, which costs 199 credits, for one page, same goes for fonts, and emotes, of all things, you can pay 1999 to unlock the other emotes, 2000 credits costs $25. Pretty outrageous right?  Assuming this doesn't bother you because you sit on a pile of money, there's still problems with the game, like aimbotting, or matchmaking. Let's start with hacks, I once saw an admin, join the district, one of the first questions he was asked is, 'Are you going to do anyhting about hackers?' He responded with this 'While we don't much care for hacking in our game it is allowed'.Then there's the matchmaking, and player's skill is tracked with bronze, silver, and gold ranks, and 9 times out of 10, I would be put up against 1-2 golds, even when I played with other people, the other team was or almost was made entirely out of gold players.  Despite the problems with the game both listed an not, it can still be pretty fun, and it has potential to be even better, but for now it's held back by glitches, hacks, exploits, and greed.
1312	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
9164	1	a	its a good game just needs some minor tuning
1348	1	a	not a bad game if i do say so myself when u play this u get a chice between gangsters and cops you get to choose aliances with major crime synidacate's and many more check it out

1878	1	a	nice graphics its like GTA ONLINE but for free
5226	0	a	STAY AWAY!!!!  This game have a really newb hostile community in its core.... **********************************************************************  I have been playing this for about 4 days now. In those 4 days i experienced,  a lot of hostility towards new players from highlevel players.  I was trying to get my wife into the game too, so i went afk for about 15 secs (in a mission) because she needed my help. when i came back to my screen, i had a really hostile whisper from a team mate, because he had seen me stand still.   I ignored it and resumed our mission, now that same guy started to TK me, and when i asked him why he did that i got 'because you are dumb' Again i I ignored him and tried to resume the mission, but he kept TKing me for the rest of the mission.  Now the mission was over and freindly fire went off, the guy started stalking me and yelling stuff about my mothers â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the global voice chat.  Another episode i had, when i joined a mission was another highlevel player, he started whispering me about my in hes opinion sucky weapon choice. I replied that i just took down 2 of the enemy team with my sucky gun.. but i was assured that it was luck.   After a while the same guy is telling us newbs in the team chat that we should â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the the bronze district and ruin the missions there instead.  Yet another episode was yesterday, when i joined a mission with 3 gold ranked players, all from the same clan (WASP) one of them ran me over with hes car, i asked him why he did that, he replied 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, you dont look where you walk' so when tried to return to the mission objective they all 3 started TKing me, and i was told that they liked to shoot low lvl players, so they ended up hunting me around the map untill the mission was ended.
2712	1	a	This game basically ruined my computer, took me 2 days before it started running back to normal I can play this game at a decent graphic setting but this game is laggy, and very P2W.  Edit: Decided to play again and feels like it has improved pretty decently would recommend. Be warned that this game eats up your RAM.
8763	0	a	Great game back in the day but pretty much dead population wise. GTA Online killed what was left when that came out. I'm amazed the servers are still on.
1897	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
7348	0	a	THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥TTTTTTTTTTT  I â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UNISTALLED AFTER PLAYING THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ OMFG DONT DL  THIS IS A LOAD OF â¥â¥â¥â¥

2758	1	a	GTA online. pretty much. If your pc can handle all the action, its worth the time. Plus free, win win?
2382	1	a	THERE ARE LOG IN BUGS PLEASE FIX
3201	1	a	this game is hilarious you can do any thing you want to... also you can choose what thing you want to be... by that I mean that you can either be a criminal or you can be a cop it is clearly your choice... aswell as doing this you can customise your character an way you want to... this game I recommend it is brilliant... well that is what I think at least 
8472	0	a	It was fun. I would recommend it if it wasnt P2W now. Sadly they ****ed up this game. It was a great game tho !
6643	0	a	Looks so fake i can`t play that...
2602	1	a	GTA Online, free to play, nuff sed
3756	0	a	Updated as of 26/08/2016: So as a game that I have known for over 5 years now, there are times where you feel like coming back just to see what's up, and see if anyone you once knew is still playing. Keep in mind I haven't quit this game, but more of retiring from it until futher notice.  Now I can agree with a large amount of new players who have just tried this game, yes there are a few hackers out there, it makes it fustrating and you never want to touch this game again unless they fix it. However you'll find some sort of cheater in any F2P game, whether it be an aimbot, they're abusing a glitch, wallhacks, invincibility, etc. I understand that with FairFight they're trying to push back the amount of hackers in the game, but with each new day that passes by, these people will find a way to try and bypass it and survive on this game a little longer, even if it means one extra hour of tormenting the playerbase, and once that character is banned, it's that easy for them to make a whole new account and start it all over again.  However I've put up with my fair share of hackers and all that crap over the past 5 years in this game, and while it does tend to annoy me, it's never gotten to me to the point I've uninstalled APB. I just put up with it and wait for the next mission. My problem with this game at the moment, is the lack of content recently. It's been over 2 years now since the last contacts were released, and basically everyone who is R255 either sits in social cause there's nothing to do, they make a brand new character and level that to 255, rinse-repeat, or just leave the game until something new comes up to bring them back for a short period. Some players have even asked for a new game-mode, such as turf wars or racing district, instead of picking between repeated missions with the same opp, or fight club.  But what do we get instead? Joker box after joker box with a new gun that tends to be useless compared to some of the original weapons, and then you decide to release another version of that JMB weapon for credits or by forcing your players to spend 100's of dollars just to get it as a loyalty reward. I get it, a free-to-play game needs to get it's revenue from somewhere, and for APB it's the marketplace, but to care more about another gamble box over actual content for players in action districts like a new contact? No wonder why everytime I get on the game looks dead as f**k.  It really dissapoints me, as I saw alot of potential in this game, but to see where it's landed itself now makes me wish I could pull the plug on it before it suffers any longer. So to anyone who's thinking about installing this game, as a veteran of this game, I suggest you hold back and wait, it's not worth the hard drive space as of this moment.
6582	0	a	Used to be a great game years ago, but now it's complete ****.
477	1	a	I played this game a lot everybody says that it is P2W but its not you can be better normal weapons,yeah the Premium thingy is a little bit P2W but you can solve it whit playing more highly recommding this game one of my favorite games (i didnt play on steam account thats why it only says 118 hrs on record)
5928	0	a	over priced and dead they arnt reviving it there just milking the rest of it dry, the pop was high then they banned all the cheaters and pop is dead. still find people using hacks and auto aims. In short over priced shop and game is dead, ive spent plenty of hours and money on it and i dont recommend you waiste your time at all.
9955	1	a	My favorite part is when the starting sequence is completely invisible to me.
9645	1	a	this gaem suc
6660	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bugged game dont waste ur time on this game totally useless, too much time and internet data wasting zz
9407	0	a	It says that I played this game for 14 hours... this 14 hours of trying to get it to work, this incluedes making an acount and trying to verify it for ages and also I had to make several accounts attempting and waiting to see if it would work but in the end I gave up!
9794	0	a	Horrible Graphics and almost no actual good storylines, until this gets better i don't suggest anyone to play or download this dog sh*t of a game
3094	1	a	This Game Is Not As Good as U May Think But It's Similar To Saints Row 3 and Grand Theft Auto Except You Have The Choice Of Playing As Good At The Start Or Bad:Fighting Against Crime Or Fighting AlongSide Crime Of Course I Chose To be Good :D But Yeah This Game Is Basically Grand Theft Auto Etc. Rating:6/10
2533	1	a	ermergerd love this game. only good with a relatively good internet tho.
2794	1	a	i dunno man, this reminds me of Saints Row + Gta
2896	1	a	This game is like GTA online bt withought the worry that it will be outadated by a new system or a new vertion because it is on the computer you never have to worry about it being replaced by GTA 6 OR 7 because it will never go away and if you get another computer you can just pull it up on it instead of getting a new x-box or ps5
5371	0	a	I have never raged as hard before or since playing this game...
5478	0	a	Too many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s be stupid spending their hard-earned money just to make â¥â¥â¥â¥ing new players hate this motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, I mean seriously, GET YOUR LIVES OUT OF YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ASSES! Too many premium players are bullying newcomers, all games SHOULD HAVE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING balance on your matchmaking and not let premium guns get SO OVER-â¥â¥â¥â¥ING-POWERED. I hate when these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s just bully and pick on people to make them rage. I think it is unethical and just plain annoying, that's all I have to say.
6332	0	a	1 word. HACKS! id rather stab myself in the stomach then ever place the â¥â¥â¥â¥ign peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game again. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the community, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the devs, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the fans
9763	0	a	it is â¥â¥â¥â¥
1271	1	a	The lag on this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke, it actually just makes you angry when you play because the server is so crap it can't handle the game itself. you get good days and bad but really, Don't drop a single cent into this game as I made the mistake of doing, you'll get owned by aimbotters who don't care if they get banned because they just create new free accounts and start all over again. I just played a game now after some time and wow, the lag made me want to throw my laptop into a wall.
4443	0	a	Recently hacks have been released again and the game is now dead every person a hacker. its hackers vs hackers. and now brazilians are allowed on NA SERVERS. but you know their â¥â¥â¥â¥ favela ping wont affect out gameplay ohhh nooo dont worry g1. but seriously i didnt think it could get any worse till i say that. download it to expericne raw footage of the highest scum. Peace.  I decided to give a little more insite to never download this game......   Alright. I got lovely info for the â¥â¥â¥â¥sticks who wanna play this game. you mind as well get your doctor to live with you in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. got ltl camping double teamers hacking. oficially every person besides me hacks. Ik people who have just for the purpose decided to hack to see how many people actually wall hack. almost every person we faced was using aim bot. How badly could you â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gamers first. you dislexic or somthing? like your fairfight is actually â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and works for â¥â¥â¥â¥. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the game. just wanted to take one little peek from playing it a while ago to see this even worse. people just hack cause other hack. you dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ reatrds can easily fix the game but you wan tto sit on your â¥â¥â¥ and do â¥â¥â¥â¥. â¥â¥â¥â¥ Apb.  So ik somone who was banned technically by accident. so as he requested some support, they replied with this 'we will no longer receive emails from this account thank you'. so he spent like over 1000 dollars and he will never get it back. Also i was in game and i called this Gm out and asked him 'why did they do that to my friend'. he went silent and instead muted me for 3 days........ like??  You will often see people on these reviews saying they cant quit but they put a thumbs down like me. well just watch that south park episode when stan gets hooked on that free game app but spent thousands on it. Episode i think was called 'FREEMIUM' or somthing. Its basically that. ill urge anyone to not join this game. sure you win lots and you lose lots but when they ban a guy who â¥â¥â¥â¥ talks then gets banned the next day, but a hacker hacks for 6 months trigger bot and everything fully blatant hacker to get banned. idk you tell me.  Update 5 FINAL REVIEW UPDATE. Play to lose. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ This game. Had a little kid yell at me on Voip and i said one thing and he ignored me. best experience yet.  So ik i have like posted these reviews so close together but the first few were over some time. Officially im no longer going to play this game till the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Developers make a new god dam sever to put the ultra try hard reroles out of the game. its no longer fun. like this game will ruin you. I beg you dont play please god let this game die and let the company go bankrupt please. All it is, is rerolles that when you died once they tea bag you just cause they camped around a corner. This game has lost me as a player. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you gamerfirst suck C-O-C-K. Listen to you players and maybe you wont continue to lose people to these no life 30 year olds with no jobs and on welfare. True story to people who do not play and mostly mexicans for some reason on north amaerican servers. Good day. And please take this into consideration, iv never played a game where the community will make fun of you just for saying 'i have not gotten a good team in a while' it was like i was in court and i had to fight if i was gonna die or not. these people were like completley smothering me like i was a mass offender. im a player. who will never again play this game till i see change. Good day. #killapb  Update 4. Officially the worst game now.  So i come on and all it is is max rank golds that are 30 year old men â¥â¥â¥â¥ talking and all they say is you bro salty man lmao dude salty â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE WORD SALTY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ STOP USING THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORD. they say they are good and they have 30 000 hours on the game. like get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing job. Sad. Die game just lay down in a dark hole and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing die.  Update 3.   I have 2 days off of work this monday and tusday and these no lifers play all â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day with shotguns like do they not have lives do they go to school or work or just sit on this game. This game is DONE this game is dead. DO NOT PLAY this game. you will want to shoot your self . all iut is is shotgunners that go back behind a wall and shoot over and over. like this guy i see him on 247 like he should be banned for how much he plays like honestly get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing life. WORST GAME EVER 10/10. plus i play enforcers as myt main and the matches i was just put in was Max gold Max rank/level and my team was like level 50s and my like 200.(or whatever) like how is that okay Apb get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sakes.  Update 2. I have decided to change this game back to not reccommended due to the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lagg and that if you start playing at night the ultra try hards come on. I just faced a group of 4 people with the bolt and attachments or cj3 and ect. At night there is no point in playing this game you will have no fun. i will no longer play after 8:30 cause all the 30 yo old dude come on with their whole team and go on team speak and like get this game so far up their â¥â¥â¥ they can smell it. DEVS****** PLEASE implement a god dam platnum rank so they ultra try hards can leave. ill be honest im deacent at the game but since im in gold i face th etop players all the time and they are max gold 10s. there should be another rank that is harder to get into but puts those super try hards out of these servers. yeah i could play on bronze servers but its too easy and gold is too hard. so what else is there to do. FAZE OUT THE TRY HARDS INTO A NEW SERVER******* i have told this to people on apb and eveyrone says this is a great idea. but devs will do nothing so. Not reccommended. Have a fun time with my â¥â¥â¥â¥ spelling. have a great day.   Update 1 .  After playing this game more i decided to change my review from no, to yes. due to the more experience you have in the game you start knowing whats good any whats not. its almost impossible to play on your own though as a begginer i will say that. but i met some people that were playing for a long time and joined them. I got to know more about the game and yes i did have some money dumped into my account. the game is still fun once you start getting things and i do enjoy that they give some promo codes away from time to time even if the things i get only last a while. The only thing i dont like is i guess that buying some of the things is a little expensive but thats what im just saying. i was going to buy one gun and it was on sale it was like 3000g1c or whatever and it came out to like 33$ to buy and i said forget that and didnt buy it for that reason. so buy it if you want a game to play and be ready to have a little frustration with some people who do buy op guns and you tempted to spend some as well. not saying the begginer gun is bad. it isnt if you know how to use it. There is lost of techniques.
7232	0	a	I played this game thinking it would be like GTA with vigilantes, but it was just a medium sized map, with mission after mission, with no sense of self! I didn't feel like a criminal because they kept telling me that I had to make friends with other gangs, and it's also really hard to distinguish another criminal with an enforcer. Overall, I felt short-changed, even though I got this for free.
2413	1	a	pay to win like â¥â¥â¥â¥, fun as hell for about a week then it gets repetitive.
10806	1	a	great game playing since closed beta
1145	1	a	You can become a gang member in this game.
3934	0	a	Used to be oke. then the EdgeLords came and ruined the game TriHard Cx Scuffed Jays Watermelon tykisha.
5841	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.
6326	0	a	Trash
1705	1	a	lag the f out man XD!!!! 
5490	0	a	it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and wont play
5433	0	a	another game where the launcher has fallen to â¥â¥â¥â¥. 10/10 if it whould let me launch it aagain.
2213	1	a	It's pay to win &amp; the loading screens got loading screens... but still you can make you character look awesoome!
3377	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
1147	1	a	10/10 would reload again.
2890	1	a	Kinda cool! :D
3112	1	a	Absolutely Love this game, takes combat to a whole new level.
5024	0	a	PAY TO WIN
8709	0	a	Okay it is a good game totally right but it is always kicking me outta game :( It is not the reason of my 'recommendation'
10682	1	a	Ascend got screwed over by HiRez, but it is still a fun game. I hope the community can fill in where the developer failed. 8.5/10, with points lost for a bad matchmaking system, high master server pings for no reason, poor optimization, and a bad developer that ignores the community.
5652	0	a	I cant launch it closes the launcher i hope the dev gets ran over ohhhh and watch 10000000 fanboys are going to spam me with tiyney wittle wage commwents oooh im willy swarwd &gt;:( i hate this stupid idiotic developers!
1653	1	a	this is, well play it yourself and see...
1567	1	a	  Liked this. But dislike all the hacks
8402	0	a	i really wanted to like this game.. but i can't
8096	0	a	This is both the best and worst game I have played.   But the disadvantages definitely outweigh the advantages.   First off, you join APB and it seems pretty damn cool - the customization is extremely enticing, and is probably the best thing about the whole damn game. But then after you first create your character and have gone through basic game mechanics in the tutorial, you have to begin doing 'missions' which are a total and utter waste of time since the hierarchy system is as much use as a chocolate fireguard. You work through some crappy 'Threat level' system ... Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold - sounds like it is fairly simple but it's not. As soon as you move from newbie Green, and into Bronze you suffer from the worst insults ever from the community just based on the bloody colour of the logo next to your name - not even on your play ability!. For anyone new, this gets bloody annoying and will surely steer people away from the game.  I have been playing this for a year now, and have been Silver only a handful of times - only to move back into Bronze. I wouldn't mind, if the matchmaking system actually worked. Now tell me GamersFirst - how is it so that 4 bronze competitors can match in skill and experience against 1 Gold and 3 Silvers for example, that have Rocket and Grenade Launchers... how are these advanced players even able to pick that they want to be in a Bronze server? Of course when there is the 'easier' option, people will take it. Therefore why not remove that opportunity and keep Golds in Gold servers and Silvers in Silver servers. This is how the game was meant to be - so why not fix it? I understand people will say 'Oh there's no excuse to new people and bronzes, teamwork and skill can overcome any opponent - ' No, you're having a laugh. More experienced players have more advanced mods and weapons (and sometimes even hacks, but that's only on occasion now) not to mention experience, so of course the newer players and lower down players have no chance at all.   Another thing to point out, is that most of the community has gone to shreds. Today, I was called 'noob' followed by other eye-rolling names by a Silver on a Bronze server for killing them. Hmm hang on there? Killing them - that's the point of the game isn't it? And if anyone wishes to call me a 'noob' so be it but - really, they're a bit of a hypocrite if they're more advanced and have to stick to the server for Bronzes and newcomers. Furthermore, people often get annoyed with newbies Team Killing them - yes so do I, but if you communicate with them and tell them that you're on their team, and help them learn instead of just expecting them to be advanced and instantly know what the hell they're doing - the APB community will become a better place, and will save any frustration.  So here's the good stuff listed:  1 Extremely addictive 2 Customization 3 Variety of weapons/mods to unlock (without having to pay with REAL MONEY on Armas Marketplace) 4 (Team Work) - [In brackets because it's not always there] 5 Rewarding missions and Fight Club is great 6 Numerous different contacts to level up 7 Season events (Halloween, Christmas etc.)  And a summary of the bad stuff:  1 Newcomers will probably find it overwhelming 2 Bronze servers littered with higher threat levels 3 Needs a new matchmaking system 4 Community needs to be more helpful and more willing to accept new players 5 More communication between players 6 Server lags often occur, especially during Fight Club due to amount of players 7 Frustration when people are 'Away From Keyboard' during a mission - why not just kick them? 8 Occasional hackers 9 Just rude players genuinely ruining a game with so much potential  Ultimately, I'd say if you haven't, give this game a try. But in all honestly, it's just not worth the brain melting frustration.
7137	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
6210	0	a	It's a pay to win game, or with extreme skill or hacks you will be able to live through a whole mission without dying.  3,5 out of 10 would bang if i was forced to.
8947	0	a	Ignore the community's existence and you're good to go :^)
8889	1	a	Fallen Earth. A game based on around the Apocalypse in the year 2156. It's a cool concept and was definately in its own league when it was averaging in the thousands for players on daily login a few years ago.  'Is this game like Fallout?' No, they share the same genre. Nothing more. Fallen Earth tops Fallout when it comes to roleplaying and exploration. I've been playing this game for 6 years, I've still only achieved 25% of the achievements on Steam and still haven't found all the tourist spots.   'Is the game dead?' Compared to its prime? Yes. I'd prefer the term 'quiet' there's still a large number of people playing Fallen Earth in areas all over the game world. If anything, it adds to the genre of it being a post apocalyptic game with players being few and far between.  This game is heavily based around crafting, as such the in game economy is subject to amazing highs and devastating lows. Inflation sets in, items you farmed for hours are worth nothing and that one item you kept hold of is worth a small fortune. Give or take a certain length of time it returns back to normal.  The controls in this game leave a lot to be desired, it doesn't compare to your up to date MMORPG currently on the market, but that is not where this game is a powerhouse. It's not in PvP either.  So what has this game got, that all other games on the market seem to lack? A social community. Fallen Earth was and is full of players who have roleplayed with one another and had a blast, those who have made clans numbering in the thousands for membership and those who organise fairs for everyone in the game to attend.   So should you play this game? Yes. Don't expect the game to blow you away. The game is what you make it and for me it is not only a game that has allowed me to meet so many good people but also blow me away whenever I come back to it.   The only way for us to get this game worked on again is to get enough players to come back so they will realised Fallen Earth should not be abandoned. The potential here is massive. Lets not waste it.
109	1	a	GAVNO game.I'll better play RS.
4130	0	a	This is a classic FTP (free to play) P2W (pay to win) which is not fair for people like me who just don't have the money to throw at a video game just to have fun (now of course I don't mean paying the initial price for a game I am reffering to spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars just to get the upperhand on the rest of the community). Now on the contrary if you do have that kind of spare cash then this game won't be THAT bad for you, you will have access to all the customization and guns and whatnot. Overall I would give this game a 5/10 simply due to there not being GTA V for PC yet and this being the closest I know of to GTA V multiplayer.
4786	0	a	I'd rather rip my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and feed that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to a dog than play this game.
7388	0	a	PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!!! This game was really bad, i think this game same like GTA. But, this game just like trash with big size on my PC. And also, the customize characters doesnt like Saints Row. And I really hated about lag connection.
7967	0	a	This game is very very P2W.  and If you don't believe me, go ahead, and you will find out that its very p2w during your first mission, you will have someone with a gun that takes you down with 2 shots, because he/she bought this gun on market place, but you start with probably one of the best free machine guns in game, and you have to put half of the magazine to kill someone, so stupid!
4694	0	a	11/10 would not recommend, game still is broken
5677	0	a	Pay to win. To many overpowered items and features for people who spill out hundreds of dollars into this game. Was really fun at first but then it got very repetitive.
6287	0	a	dont play this game
3581	1	a	Is it me or is the stearing slow
3188	1	a	Great game &lt;3
2978	1	a	THIS IS ALSOME!!!
6637	0	a	this game sucks
10773	1	a	I just realized I played this game somewhat in the future.
9170	1	a	Detroit, Detroit never changes.  This game is a simulation of the aftermath of the collapse of Detroit. As you roam the streets and search for other sane denizens of downtown Detroit, you will encounter many vile mutant hobos, street gangs, feral dogs and even the fabled Detroit Lawnmower gang, who truly are a formidable foe. As you fight to keep your sanity in the streets of Detroit you will uncover its darkest secrets. Detroit is a dangerous place, children, remember to pack your gasmask because Detroit's atmosphere is toxic due to the large amount of drug and automobile use. The number one way to survive this harsh enviroment is to do the Detroit shuffle, I know that this might seem to be a difficult task at first but once you've done it, you'll never forget. Detroit truly is a dangerous place. Overall this Detroit simulation is good, it sums up the trials and tribulations of downtown Detroit perfectly. The weapons are a perfect representation of what one will find in the dark corners of Detroit. The only con to this game is that there is not enough Detroit, as one can never have enough Detroit. Overall, this game is good. If you are looking for a good Detroit simulator then this is the game for you.  10/10 -Detroit Remember kids; when in trouble, do the Detroit shuffle.  
2727	1	a	It's a tough game. Hard to learn te dynamics and when you really hit someone. It's a very cool game... something like GTA but only with players, including the Police!!! :D Everyone who likes GTA will have some real fun with this one!
6910	0	a	i wasted 45 mins of my life on this game....
6551	0	a	Hate Weapons that Expires!!
6772	0	a	This game is not even loading i said BULLSH*T and start smashing my keybored
635	1	a	Great customization, be who you wanna be. Great running gun battles, drive bys.. Like GTA but more freedom and custom cars.
4586	0	a	DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IN DOWNLOADING THIS GAME IT IS FULL OF HACKERS AND THE DEVS DON'T CARE!!!!  It has so much potential to be a great game, but unless you're hacking, don't waste your time!! You can purchase the hacks online, those are the ones that the Devs don't do anything about, do not download a free hack or it will be picked up!! Why am I telling which hacks work? Because I want this game to go down and be destroyed along with all the hacker â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and useless devs. If you make a game, get rid of hackers or land up being a â¥â¥â¥â¥ title that is overrun by a small population of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and loses out on a possibly very supportive fan base.
495	1	a	A fun game to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in, nothing more. Better with friends, hell alone. Its a fun game and ok
10511	1	a	Its a great game but steam support was recently broken. Download the standalone from the website.
7987	0	a	I did not even to get to play after character creation for more than 10 seconds before I was perma-banned by some admin.
3301	1	a	Great game i would recommend to anyone
4029	0	a	Customization: 11/10 Gameplay: Meh.  If you enjoy painful grind, even more versus opponents that have end-game weapons like a spam-cuz-bad nade launcher, then dive head first into it. Because yes, this puts newbies versus experienced and geared-up players. 
286	1	a	If you want a review listen to me. These people are the same creators as GTA. Can you stop posting unprofessional comments like '10/10 Barely Played it'. If you commented that wouldn't you have click the thumbs down button? You guys that thinks this game sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ you guys. THIS GAME IS AWESOME! 1000/1000

283	1	a	APB Reloaded is almost the free Grand Theft Auto Online but you can be a cop or crook so this game is very interesting to play so i would this game out of scale 10 9.5 out of 10
1124	1	a	If you don't mind grinding and playing against P2W â¥â¥â¥â¥ It's gud game

6023	0	a	Bad company. 1- Many bugs in-game 1- bad community 1-
5056	0	a	It's free, it's fun, and it got loads of customizations!  But sadly, the community is horrible, filled with trashtalkers and hackers.  It also get boring fast due to lack of game modes with PVP system only.  I wouldn't recommend this game lest you're the type of a gamer who's competitive or masochistic.
2050	1	a	THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER THEE FUNEST PART OF ALL PRESSING THAT BUTTION THAT SAIS UNINSTALL OMG SO FUN!!!
306	1	a	cool game
8456	0	a	Stay far away from this horrible piece of garbage! It doesn't even start up anymore, and it takes a freaking century to start up because of the toxic waste known as its launcher. I've never seen such a waste of time!
4796	0	a	9/11 Would uninstall again
9194	0	a	This game gave me cancer
3898	0	a	ok so this was my all time favorite game on steam  even with its p2w features, i liked the game  you can make tons of friends while playing it  why i dont recommend you say?  well for some unknown reason they banned me, i sent a ticket asking why and they responded with 'your acc has been permanently disabled'  500+ 200hr on this game just to get banned  The game itself is a fun game, G1 doesnt care about the game, all they want is money  Pros and cons in my point of view Pros +customization +lots of guns +lots of cars +decent sized map to play  Cons -p2w -hackers -G1 -p2w -G1 -and some more hackers  PS. i would have recommended this game if they had not done me dirty.  -G1
6318	0	a	The â¥â¥â¥â¥? I didn't even play this. It was left on in the background without even a window.  
7323	0	a	this didnt work. it just took up room and now i cant delete it 
98	1	a	(Note: I have not played this game in many years).  So, this can be a fun game.. The community sucks, but it can be fun at times. I'm just going to put an up-vote on it simply for the good times I had on it (while at the same time trying not to think of the bad times). I could make a really serious, thoughtful review, like usual. I even typed one up and erased it.   You know what, I'll make a somewhat decent review. That sounds nice. So:   Lag: There is a lot of it. Everyone on the server lags, Heck, the server itself lags. Try out the two closest servers to you. I used to play on one server that I thought would be the best for me, but it turned out that the next closest one was better. The difference was barely noticable while playing, but it made all of the difference.  Hackers: Are there any? For the most part, not really. At least when I used to play, there were not.There were a few rare cases, but it was not often. What I noticed when changing from one server to the other is that I lagged just half a second less than other people, letting my hits register like they were supposed to and everything worked normally. Different connections to the server can make a big difference.  Pay to win: This game is really big on paying for weapons with real cash. There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while. (Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)  Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.  Creativity/customization: There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.  Matchmaking: From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.  Frustration: Expect it.  What else.. what else.. hmmm....  Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.  Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.    Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!   So, now to what I really wanted to say:  So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.
4169	0	a	If I was stuck in a room with only a computer,a copy of APB, and a fully loaded revolver--I'd shoot myself 6 times before I play this steaming â¥â¥â¥â¥.
243	1	a	One of my favorite free to play games.   Game is free to play action shooter. Playing feels like GTA but in multiplayer world with 2 teams war. You can play policeman or criminalist and fight together in missions around the city. You can customize your cars, characters, weapons, clothes and many other things. You can also level up your characters with missions. With money which you earn from missions you can buy cars, weapons, ammo, clothes, perks and a lot of other things depends on which level you are. As most of free to play games, this game is also 'pay to win'. Because it's free it also has a lot of hackers.  Developers are pretty active and they are constantly supporting and updating game. They have also improved anti cheat system.  I reccommend this game to everyone who like open world action shooter multiplayer games. It's free to play so grab it and try it because you won't lose nothing. Also playing with friends is really fun. 9/10
7556	0	a	This game is terrible. I'm so tired of mmo developers thinking that they can get away with aweful gameplay. The matchmaking is down right infuriating. The worst part has to be the driving as it feels like you are driving on ice the entire time. The gun play is lackluster and something I would expect from a ps2 launch title not a PC game from this decade.
1105	1	a	Best point and click adventure game ever 10/10
7403	0	a	pay to win sorry excuse of a game
8152	0	a	WOW, You name the hack, here it is.. shocking amount of cheating, And high lvl VIP coming into servers just to blow you away Most likley because they are bored!! I gave it every chance and tried to ignore the warning`s posted by other`s and give this a go..OMFG!! be warned DO NOT DO THE SAME.. I promise you, I deplore you not to download this game.. Unless you have every intent on hacking like most in this game.. then join with your hacking brothers!! Such a shame has great potential, But clearly made to make a few quid and close this one down like they did the first!! Cant give this a lower thumbs down if i tried 100% thumbs down!!
4560	0	a	This game is absolute garbage. Unless of course you feel like spending your money to have an advantage over everyone...
7642	0	a	I Spawned as a cop, ran over 10 people, shot 5, wrecked 3 cars and unistalled due to gameplay. Man it sucks, what type of cop am ?
4689	0	a	This game is awful, its full of cheaters and it lags terribly. Plus the Devs are pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and its a p2w, so if you enjoy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games, cheaters, and having to pay for anything good in the game then you will love it. I wouldnt reccommend this game to anybody, literally anybody, not even my worst enemy.
979	1	a	I would recommend this game because it is not Pay2Win. This game actually requires very much skills and knowledge ;) When you have played like 40 hours you should know enought to be good at this game. The ingame community is suprisingly funny but sometimes rude. It is my favorite game because I never laughed my â¥â¥â¥ off that much with my friends ;) 
8908	1	a	Fallen earth is a great game that has a larger then most like learning curve,and that's most likley why it gets bad reviews. For being 7 years old and has no Dev support for the last couple. I still have a lot of fun running around the wastelands. It's crafting system is one of the best I have ever come across in any other MMO, only one better is SWG.  I would recommend this game over many of the new trash cookie cutter WOW clones that have been coming out lately.
5019	0	a	oh my god I play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ at 16-20 fps and I'm so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good at it  but this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥  don't download it  pls.
5794	0	a	Not bad game but staff is suck. I spent a lot of money to this game and they banned me twice with no reason.
5010	0	a	I can't do much of a review game never truly launched. I use windows 7 professional 64x. Pro free Con wasted about 90 minutes trying to get to play it.
10420	1	a	poor graphics, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. much better
1391	1	a	this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ to say straight up its gay guys gayst possablie it sucks pooooooooooo
2931	1	a	Prepare to die... A LOT! Particularly whilst you're new. Great character / car customisation, combat is so, so and be prepared to come across the odd cheater or two.  Apart from that it's good enough to waste a few hours on.
8214	0	a	somethings wrong with it. wont let me get on or make an account
8854	0	a	So bad it is literally forcing me to close down steam in the task manager just to even be ABLE to uninstall it.
2348	1	a	Great customization and average gameplay. Great for dicking around with your friends.
3923	0	a	Now don't get me wrong, this game is absolutely wonderful, been playing this damn game for a few years now. So this is more of a reluctant unrecommended review. But anyways I'm pretty sure some other reviewer can fill you in better in the good stuff, so I think it's unecessary to talk about the areas where APB shines brightly with ease. So let me briefly cut to the chase.   What I dislike about the game:    Matchmaking is so bad it's laughable.   It's usually you or the opposition who is getting their arses kicked in the corner. A little less than occasionally there is a fair fight and well that's where the real thrill comes from it.    'I knew it, i'm surrounded by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.'   [Kudos to anyone who knows this quote] Trolls, Griefers, and Cheaters are pretty common around the servers.[Or perhaps i'm just unlucky?]   Golden Cash-Cows  If you see someone with Gold Status, chances are they're premium wh**es armed to the teeth with premium guns, rocket launchers, and impossible superior accuracy[Hacker?].   Ridiculous Real Prices  $50+ for your average/op virtual gun. $100+ for a friken tommygun. lol wut? I know that it's a free to play game, they have to get compensation, and I fully understand that. But ffs.   The small yet completely noticeable holes in customization  While there are nearly limitless possibilites of customization in the game, little things like gender/faction only clothing is so ridiculous it's annoying. I mean seriously? They have licensed vigilanties protecting San Paro and exterminating 'criminals' wielding automatics and rocket launchers, when it's CLEARLY the police and military's job, but a woman can't wear men-like clothing or look like a tomboy? One word, 'Why?'   What it says in the description.     'Constantly evolving gameplay and events, with new content added regularly'   Now that's a lie when I see one. Okay, yes they are in fact adding content, but really, it's usually just a small 'fix', or some stupid limited-time weapons and customization items that nobody really knows or cares about. And I may not know much about the videogame developing world, but I think it would be very.....VERY wise to prioritise actually FIXING the game instead of just force feeding us this money grubbing bullsh*t. Now I don't care about the money grubbing because lets face it, everyone is unfortunately starting to it. F*cking Rockstar, is also doing it with it's stupid GTA: Online project. Oh yeah btw that reminds me, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THE HEISTS!? -sigh- The point is, fix your crap up FIRST, THEN advertise how greedy your company's wallet is.   The Publisher: Gamersf*ckingfirst  They're horrible at their job. Customer service is stupidly horrible, they are ALWAYS coming up with these annoying ideas of creating overpriced items and services to get your hard-earned money and let the rich little a-holes who pay, dominate us, and they just bring the cute little irony monster out with their cancer building name.   In conclusion?  Despite the mentioned, I actually still suggest trying this game out if you're an experienced fps/3rdps or at least have a good aim. If you do not have any of these qualities, I still recommend trying APB: Reloaded out, the thing is what I have to say to you is that you should not expect too much and double check on what you're getting into.
9222	0	a	requires that you make a gamersfirst account, never requires that you do NOT make a username and then requires it when logging in to the game
3765	0	a	[Wall of text,that is more of a rant ,but i think it's worth talking about]  I will review this game,but first,let me tell you about the tragic tale of the now Free 2 Play APB.
5992	0	a	I have been to funerals more fun than this
3990	0	a	It's not a bad game, but it's anything but good. The driving is annoying, the gunplay is nothing spectacular, and the AI is crappy (this is the best word I can think to describe it as).  All this is a pay-to-win mediocre cop vs robber game that's not really all that fun and could really use some major fixes and fine-tuning to mechanics.  However, because it is free, give it a try and see for yourself - some people actually enjoy these kind of shooters, so you might as well. 5/10
5845	0	a	Doesn't work/10  I guess i should say more. well you can't smoke weed, that's not very open. oh and i love pay to win, why did i give this a thumbs down again? well to sum it up, this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥in' mlg
823	1	a	i like 2 kill things and steal things it allows me to act like a criminal from the relative safety of my home 10/10 game would recommend
1309	1	a	Fun game and its even better playing with your clan mates and friends. The graphics arent bad but the game is not very well optimized. There are still a few hackers but FairFight does a good job at banning them. Overall great game!
2450	1	a	i cant download it can any body help me with the instructions :(
2883	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
7620	0	a	so bad  hard controls  not fun
7948	0	a	This game might have been better, I like the idea, I think it has potential, but the studio simply cannot deliver it in a suitable form to players. This might have been better if the weapons were more 'balanced' (in the form of not having shotguns that don't work after 12m), and the 'premium' shop is filled with reskins (of free weapons) and overpriced cosmetics.
6313	0	a	a â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of gta online
1854	1	a	Great game to play and have fun with friends. Downsides I think are really BIG problems: take ages to get characters looking good, get weapons that are awesome and to get good vehicles. Plus if you don't play for ages then suddenly come back on things usually go missing from your account; like vehicles or clothing. But all in all, a really fun game.
6131	0	a	Pros:  - Very deep character costumzation - Play as police officer or criminal - Nice graphic - PVP battles without inteferences  Cons:  - Pay to win - P2W - Victory for money - Credit Card is a mandatory - Just for people who live with parents
3438	1	a	It was a great game untill I went over to a Mac. Could the developers, if it's possible, try to make it available for Mac users also? This was by far one of my favorite games to play and I'm wishing to play this game again on my stronger computer.
8721	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible.
7737	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. Horrible netcode. Horrible performance (Uses 1.5GB of RAM when minimized) and crap support. If you didn't like this in the beta, you definelty won't like it now. This game should have died when realtime died! - Overall score: 0%
5297	0	a	This game is terible, the graphics are not good and laggy and just plain terible. Do not get this game, its worse than farmville and its nothing like GTA
8390	0	a	Made a break from this game few moths ago .. I was max level.. Didn't start again P2W and full of cheaters .. Try h1z1 .. Oh I remember how whenever we start a match we would see a guy on enemy team with oca nano .. P2W gun .. We just give up at that point :D
10622	1	a	It was fun until it decided to stop working permanently despite three or four re-installations. Tech support gave me some weird pain in the â¥â¥â¥ thing to do that involved finding some file somewhere and changing a number or deleting it or creating it, I didn't do it I don't care â¥â¥â¥â¥ your stupid game.  Also the game is pretty fun.
1253	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!
3214	1	a	great game  
2622	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
9185	1	a	The things i liked : 1. crafting 2. survival 3. Massive Multiplayer 4.you can create almost anything ;)  The things i didn't liked :  1. you can have a little money problem in game ... but don't worry you will get some soon :D .    DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! :D and add me if you downloaded this i can help you ;)
7869	0	a	this game Horrable and Broke DONT PLAY IT! Unless you enjoy rage quiting...  Has some interesting ideas but fails to stand up on them
9771	1	a	didnt even know i had this but ill recommend it anyway seems prewtty down to earth
592	1	a	this game is pay 2 win if you want to level up only with G1 Credits  i dont say we have pepole that dont buy G1 Credits and they succses in this game but mostly you need to buy G1 Credits because the weapons there is OP = over power..  so have fun and dont spent a lot of money :D  
6496	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
9355	0	a	ITS HORRIBLE THE GRAPHICS DO NOT EXIST LIKE THE WORLD IS NOTHING BUT A WHITE BOTTOMLESS PIT ITS A WASTE OF GIGS!!!
6542	0	a	This game is probably good, but I would never know.  When I installed it the first time and tried to play, I got a PhysX error saying that PhysX was uninitialised by the game. I re-installed my drivers from Nvidia control panel and then tried to get the game going again. Same error popped up. I did this 5 more times. I restarted, I turned off my monitors, I did the hokey pokey, everything. This game is unplayable. I tried to open a support ticket for this, but when I tried to open a ticket there, the page was blank except for the text 'Support is unavailable at this time.'. It's like they don't even want me to play the game. Free to play doesn't mean you can publish â¥â¥â¥â¥ like this. Even if it's free, I was still ripped off.
3348	1	a	Instead of 'Gamersfirst' it should be renamed to 'Wallets First'  8/10
6860	0	a	This game is all good except for the fact that I got a bug from it where it tells my friends that I am playing APB all the time, regardless of what I'm playing now. It also wont let me delete it because of the fact that it still thinks that I am in-game.
671	1	a	Game is good if you like a tongue in your â¥â¥â¥â¥
6917	0	a	Calling this a GTA clone is an insult to GTA. Calling it crap is a slap in the face of feces. This is just a terrible, terrible game with ps2 era graphics and gameplay.
3105	1	a	Alot of fun! Competitive, alot of room to be creative, and is a good challenge to constantly be on your game and get the advantage over your enemies, I love playing this game, it's personally my favorite free to play game on Steam
7437	0	a	Tried it for a wekend. Incredibly dull. Not recommended.
8062	0	a	The definition of Pay 2 Win.
7823	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
4778	0	a	its crap
4113	0	a	I personally didn't like it. It was very confusing and I didn't know what was going on a lot of the time. I felt like I was forced into quests when I had no clue what to do. Not only that, but the lag was horrible. Everything mixed together and made a very bad experience for me and I was discouraged to play again and because of that I never played it again so I just uninstalled it. Thankfully it's a F2P, so if you want to give it a try, I won't stop you.
5294	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.
6409	0	a	From what I have played it seems this game can be played as a pay to win mainly because everything in the game is mostly bought with real money if you want anything good just buy it all the really high damage guns and armour and everything can be bought without any real work.
6467	0	a	Extremely P2W. Over half the things you can buy with money which provides an unfair advantage to those people who have more money than others.
3180	1	a	When you are playing alone you will suffer in agony so get a friend. Then you both can suffer.  10/10 best heroin simulator
7347	0	a	You'll turn into my profile picture if you play this game.
5523	0	a	great consept, terrebly exicuted
5147	0	a	This game is alright. in my eyes i wouldnt play it 10 hours a day every day. this game is highly pay to win, and you dont get a lot for what you pay for. so many hackers in this game it isnt even funny. but all in all it is a great time waster. i just wouldnt recommend this game to people to want a fun game..
7245	0	a	to many micro transations 
10443	1	a	This game sucked and its not worth downloading nor playing.
2643	1	a	Very Addicting funny game. Nice for playing with friends. I recomend it to everyone (of coure above 18). 
1429	1	a	Cool super 
4551	0	a	Highly toxic community.
456	1	a	It's a good FTP game and all, but the devs are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
3663	1	a	takes alot of internet but it is worth it if you have good internet
7240	0	a	If u ready pay for cool new stuff than itÂ´s a game suited for you. The Hackers make the game impossible to enjoy. The Game itself would be better if the dev would change this into leveling through. I know everyone wants to make money but be so greedy is worse. GTA Online is the same if u have money than you rule. Btw the basic idea for the game is good and it would be a great game to waste u time on it if they remove the p2w.
665	1	a	This is my most played game, it is outstanding for a free to play game. With the size and variety of the virtual the city of San Paro, there is little repetition. It is the free GTA.
535	1	a	Basically what is GTA V for free but backwards in the fact that it's a MMO so there really isn't much of a story. Gameplay is fun and I had a fun time even thought these types of games aren't really my thing. Although I enjoyed customizing my character, and just roaming around the streets in my car listening to music.   I may just play for a while longer and it will keep me busy for awhile. As someone whod doesn't really like guns it's not really my thing. But if you like GTA type games then you will like this one.    This review is rather short and lacking compared to my typical review but it's just more of a short my thoughts.
7744	0	a	i DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone because the sandbox qualitys are terrible i thought this was gonna be a gta BOOTLEG. The game is okay when you take out trolls,OP guns,paying real money,etc
5996	0	a	Played It For 1.2 Hours Wanna Know Why? Ok Cuz I Tried To Load It But....NEVER DID
9830	0	a	This game sucks. U don't understand any thing it's sssooooooooooooooooooo bad game!!!!
6336	0	a	Oh dear god... this game.  It's so bad I can barely keep looking at it for even 10 seconds.  It's gameplay is terrible, graphics don't even bloody stand out, and the economy is TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE.  I can buy a HAUNTED HAT FOR A SIMPLE 1 DAY T-SHIRT.  Come with me, Haunted Hat, this game is 2shiz4me
7278	0	a	I downloaded this game, thinking it looked like a lot of fun. However, as of yet, I have been unable to play as it has been plagued with problem after problem, without ever successfully getting into the game. First, constant 'updating' that never stopped, even though it said everything was up to date. Then, after finally getting passed all that, it said the game was running. I have yet to figure out where it is, in fact, running, other than using memory. Steam says i've played 47 minutes, apparently it counts updating or something for play time. As soon as I restart my computer ( I have to restart it to even delete it ), this game will be gone. I hope they'll get it a little more under control at some point so I can check it out.
9638	1	a	this game isnt actuallt free to play :( 
9936	1	a	For someone who does not play FPS, I found this game quite enjoyable. It is not solely FPS though - you can switch to a third-person view as well. I like that versatility and the game play itself is enjoyable in my opinion. The ability to carry multiple weapons at once as well as switch them effortlessly in a fight is my favorite part of this game. So if you run out of ammunition, switch to your ax quickly and hack away at enemies before they can take you down. I also really like that there are PVP areas and the entire game is not a free for all. That is what usually steers me away from FPS games, the thought of walking up to a vendor and someone just taking me out and running off. I've experienced this and it is annoying.   The other feature I really like is the real time crafting system. You can craft while doing other things as well so you aren't stuck in one place waiting for an item to finish. In all honesty, it feels like a game that is more enjoyable with friends, which is the only reason I don't have it now but it can be good for some solo play. It's one of the good games in the free to play category, I'd definitely recommend it as I have a few times now. In fact, I am grabbing it again as I type this right now. I give Fallen Earth 10/10
7457	0	a	Wasn't that entertaining.
2921	1	a	A great Third-Person Shooter that allows for full character, car, symbol, and theme customization. That's basically the only positive aspect of APBR.  Negative aspects include a multitude of hackers and exploiters which cause for people to rage easily. The game also includes trolls which like to drive dump truck into your vehicles. Open world districts allow people not a part of your current mission to grief you with what's called 'Ghosting'.  The game is full of bannable offenses but the company, GamersFirst, does nothing about it since their ban policy is based on user input. Users need to record and report a user for a person to be banned.  If you have a weak control of emotions then I would suggest not playing this game.
9741	1	a	Yes i do reccoment this, i've played it on crappy computer and was laggy but BEASTLY got new pc and playing it and is awesome 
9075	1	a	Such wasteland, very crafting, wow.
570	1	a	Had the best moments with my friends. Rage moments , Funny moments , i recommend this game because is just awesome. But the community is not so good. Have fun with it !
6417	0	a	Full of microtransactions, gameplay isnt anything you will totally like, the only thing i really like on this game is that you can be in the same car with your mate, and drive over buggy no life city, fighting against op god like people that has bought good weapons for real money. 4/10
1425	1	a	very good....to a point....but the good is way more then the bad
5122	0	a	2/10, this game is one of the most pay2win games out there I have seen so far, incredibly unbalanced and not amusing at all, not worth the time spent. However customising the clothes is fun, too bad they are extremely hard to obtain too.
2309	1	a	One of the greatest games i've ever played. People whine about pay2win, but that's only noobs and low lvls. At a higher level, that isn't even hard to obtain from just having fun and playing without paying anything, you will notice the free weapons you buy from apb$ is just as good as the ones you can purchase for real money.   Original apb 5/5 Reloaded 4/5 - Everything is nice, but the graphics engine is really messed up. But they will soon release a new one and i will start playing this game again.
500	1	a	&gt;log in &gt;spawn my car &gt;start driving &gt;que for a mission &gt;mission starts &gt;drive to the mission &gt;hit a Telephone pole &gt;car explodes and I die &gt;I rage quit 10\10 would do that again 
7875	0	a	Major hackfest + pay to win in every way possible, it used to be a great game but the devs got greedy... avoid at all costs if you wish to keep your sanity in check.
9258	0	a	sorry but thanks to problems starting the gamei uninstall then when i did the game workd fine but i allready uninstall it soo no im installing it again wating WAYSTING MY TIME DOING SOO NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 2 OR 3 AHOURS MORE!!!!!!!!!! AND I DONT EVEN NOW IF THE GAME IS GOOD CUZZZ I COULDNT PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
5046	0	a	Not worth the download.   Community is terrible, getting teamkilled during the tutorial for not knowing the mission metagame was great. The driving isn't fun, car handling is mushy and seems like driving on ice all the time(it's not winter). The weapons and shooting aren't great either, seems like a grind fest, but without anything to grind against. 
2328	1	a	Great online FPS and Driving simulator combined into some unforgettable PvP action. Cars exploding during missions and a true cops versus robbers feel. 100 people per zone at once, so great feel of a live city during combat.
6521	0	a	this is a good game  but have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad engine
226	1	a	Really Nice and Good TO play
93	1	a	APB is a great game though it has a toxic community that might deter new players. It's a milestone for customization in games. You can cuztomize any part of your character (height, weight, muscularity, freckles, hair) you can make your own symbols to use on clothes and tattoos and cars. You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades. Most of my time is spent socializing, driving, and designing then showing off my clothes. I highly recommend it to anyone with a creative mind.
9547	0	a	Was about 3 years ago I played it, but it was sheer poop so I don't recommend it. I mean come on just look at the screenshots, the game is astonishingly fugly and not to meantion the â¥â¥â¥â¥ blocking atmosphere... Sheeshh....  Oh yeah it is free2play which means it is also pay2win.  I give it a -1337 out of 10
7026	0	a	This game USED to be truly great. But due to severe mismanagement of the original developer company. They went bankrupt which meant the Game got taken down. About a Year or so later Gamers First aquired the game.  Everyone was excited and happy the game was comming back. What followed as the DEV Blogs started comming out was a step by step description of how Gamers First was taking an axe to the original game.  They ruined several of the key aspects of the game. Most notable the Editors. But gameplay suffered greeatly aswell. My freinds and I had spent several hundreds of hours in the original. And every now and then we will give the gamers first version a go. But the game is now just a shadow of what it once was.  Dont waste your time with this...Thats the best advise I can give you.
6625	0	a	This game is more then just pay to win, it's pay to play. Your cash rewards, experience, and so forth are all dramatically reduced if you don't buy their VIP. It's not just that though, they refuse to make any new guns that you can actually unlock in the game. Every new gun is one you have to pay for! Not a single new gun has been released to public aviablilty since the restart of the actual game from APB, All Points Bulletin. If that doesn't make it bad enough, to truely enjoy yourself in the game you need to be a VIP. Why? Better and longer trials for weapons and cars, not to mention the ability to customize yourself and vehicle, emblems, and more to higher extents. The only game worse then this with a worse pay to win system is WarZ now known as 'Infestation Stores.' It is though fun to play once you're a high enough level, hackers are dealt with much easier now because of the anti-hack system known as Fair Fight was installed. There's without a doubt of equalization in weapons, but that equalization is in the ones you pay for. The graphics aren't bad, controls, mechanics, and interest isn't bad at all actually. From climbing ladders to driving off ramps from unfinished highways, civilians actively moving about the map to simply running over criminals or enforcers to catching criminals in acts of crime. There's a lot of innovation, tons of little areas to be found even when you think you know all the maps and secret locations. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the pay to win system this would be without a doubt the greatest game ever made. It's like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (the original for Xbox 360.) You can steal a civilan car for the lulz of it, or make your own from a fairly wide range of choices and if you decide to dump cash into this game that customization can truely be starstriking. I've never seen a game with more customization options in my life. If this game allowed you to unlock everything over time it'd be an absolute reccommendation, but it not only doesn't try to do this but HEAVILY avoids it. Potential never met.  Did I mention they made it so you have to buy upgrades for your friend and ignore list, or that new content is never given to those who don't pay...?
1100	1	a	Note: I actually have around 40 hours into this game, I'm not a huge noob.  This is not your normal MMO, it plays like a triple A crime game. The game takes place in a crime torn city called San Paro. The crime has gotten so bad that the mayor is giving out conceal and carry permits and letting vigilantes take justice into their own hands. So, that's where your character comes in. You start and pick a gender and customize your character. The customization options are nearly endless, and you can alter nearly every fine detail of your character. You pick to be either an Enforcer, which are the vigilantes, or a Criminal, which is pretty self explanatory. There are two main 'districts' where you can complete missions for crime bosses or respected vigilantes to increase your standing with them. These are big open worlds where you can do anything you want, whether that's doing missions, racing around, jumping your car off things, shooting stuff, well, you know, it's like GTA Online with MMO elements, which makes for an exciting game. The cars have nice variation to them, trucks have more power and less speed, cars are fairly fast and pretty weak, and then there are sport cars which are very fast and pretty weak, unless you equip them with extra armor. This game has many complaints about being pay to win, but I don't find it that way at all. I haven't put a penny in it, and feels pretty fair and balanced to me. The guns have some good variation to them too, which fit basically all playstyles. The mssions are team based, and are mainly the bad guys doing bad stuff, and the good guys getting sent out to stop them. It can actually be pretty fun though. The criminals can aslo commit crimes to make money, and Enforcers can catch criminals to make some extra cash. The community is ok, except for your occasional truck griefers, which you'll find out what they are most likely in your game time. So now, let's break it down.  Pros: Great Graphics Fun gameplay Good Variation Wide range of vehicles Nearly everything is customizable It's free You can do basically anything you want  Cons: Occasional lag Community can suck at times Textures don't always load in instantly Can feel repetitive if you're grinding to level up  I rate this game a 9/10
1997	1	a	This is a vary versitile game that can be both fast paced and slow paced at times. The servers are always being worked on which can at time have a negative effect on the gameplay but they never last so long that it becomes an issue for groups. The in-game features are fantastic and G1 is always releaseing new content for purchase.  This game is very graphically demanding and I would recommend making sure that your PC meets the recomended specs before even thinking about dowloading this game. I run an i7 3770k with a 2BG GTX 660 and I get around 100fps. So make sure that you have good gear in your PC.  I very much recommend this game. It's in third-person which is always a nice change to the normal first person shooter games out there. Very fun with friends and I hope they can continue to develop more content for this amazing game. Get it!
10762	1	a	An Honest review...  While I have so far reasonably enjoyed this game, it still has flaws that I want to point out. They aren't too game changing but it pulls me away from saying this game is brilliant. This is just my honest review and it is certainly no hate to the game, I still recommend it.  I admire the creativity. I really enjoy skiing, though the original control layout is a little odd. This made me relize that this wasn't just a Halo emulator. I'm not too much of a fan of the jetpack but I think that'll just take getting used to or I just don't like jetpacks at all since I hardly ever use them in Halo Reach and Halo 4 either.  The game plays like a good FPS, far better than the quality of the CoD series but it isn't quite up their with my favourite FPS' like Halo and Half-Life but hey it is free.  So now I am on to the negatives. I'm sorry fan boys but I want to be honest here.  Firstly I personally wouldn't say it quite meets up to the fast gameplay.  Yes you can reach high speeds while skiing but even times like that are limited. You probably travel a lot faster in this than in other FPS' but it isn't displayed in a fast paced fashion so you don't feel it. Half-Life feels faster, TF2 feels faster and those games don't advertise their games as fast.  That isn't too game changing but it wasn't what I thought it would be. The gameplay just isn't good as the 'reviews' say so. It is still fun but I don't like the spaced out approach they used for a 'fast paced' game.  Also you need almost sniper precision when using an assault rifle... BUT HEY!  The game is free and reasonably fun, how can you go wrong? 
6345	0	a	Do not play this game it is terrible and Gamersfirst will probably ban your account that you have spent a lot of your own money on because they ban random people including me for false accusations of hacking, cheating or exploiting.
136	1	a	APB Reloaded is pure competative PvP, if you don't like playing or is terrible at PvP and FPS, you will hate this game. This is a Free to Play game, that is also Pay to Win. Try this game and see if you like it.  I tried APB for a few hours over the years ( I actually also played this game some in beta before it was free2play) and realized it would not be a good game for just anyone.   It was sort of fun being a criminal, but as a cop, it is harder. You have a car driving game through the city streets filled with cars, people, sidewalk objects, all things that you can hit or miss depending on your driving skills.   The combat part is where it is unenjoyable, your success depends on your weapons, shooting skill and teamwork skills, but it seems all the players you meet in the game are better than you and have better weapons, or they have godlike shooting skills by hacking while using the best weapons. The combat part is unavoidable part of questing to level up and unlock new gear.   The veteran player community does not like noobs on their team, if u look like a noob, they kick you off team or leave team. If you are pugging with other noobs, you will lose most challenges. And the matchmaking is crap still.  The fashion creation part is sort of ok except you have to level up to unlock fashion parts too.  If you have real money to throw at this game then you can buy the best gear and look good playing.   The devs lately have added a new hacker protection system that might help stop hacking. Not sure if the Hacker protection system is working or just falsely banning people.   Play this free game at your own risk. Don't pay real money for this game.

747	1	a	This Game Just Like Gta 5 And Saint Row Put Together. Its A Awsome Game I Love This Game. If U Can Buy Houses And Stay In Them This Game Will Be the best out of all them. But U Can Do Soo Much In This Game And It Free
7598	0	a	Although the game is really good it has the most amazing customization on any game ever created you can customise basically anything and the gameplay is okay-ish. Now the bad things about this game: Lagg and i mean ALOT OF LAGG and it seems they don't do alot to fix it it get's even more broken with every patch, 2nd thing P2W if you're unfamilliar it means PAY2WIN basically buy guns and you just do good even if you were born 2 seconds ago and you found out what a mouse is. 3rd Hackers and like lagg its ALOT of them and the worst thing is that the producers of the game don't do anything about it if you payed money for this game, You can just hack away you'll never get banned. Not to mention the in-game community is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥. But since it is a 'free' game i guess you can download it and try it out and yes you will have some fun with it until you just start raging at hackers or lame vip missions etc.
1080	1	a	Ive been with this game before it came out on steam and when i first came out the amount of progress that have got into this game is amazing im still playing this game and i wont stop playing until all servers are shutdown or n new stuff comes out but yes i recommend this game  Pros and cons Cons: The game is really hard to play and you need to have Voce communication Its recommend for this game and that you also need to put time into this game when you start out You will die alot but over time you will become good at this game  Pros: The Customizeing in this game is out standing you can go into so much detail into this game its unbeliveable also with the graphics are old but they still look good the Car driving is also amazing ome cars are really hard to controll but you can get used to it easyliy You can play with Freinds also You will be able to roam any where in the world and you will be able to join in events to earn quick and fun rewards after completeing the event   Now theres a couple of bugs with in this game like sometimes seeing green background or the audio is Cracking up or you will see the servers are down but theres 30 people in the server the server is still up you can still join just saying   I HOPE THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL HAVE FUN PLAYING :)
5396	0	a	It is a pile of wank........ Stop buying in-game guns if you have already and use the money to buy a p*rnhub subscription, Becuase if you have wasted money on in-game guns those are probably the only t*ts you will see for a long while
5077	0	a	this game is really fun and all but it is a pane in the butt because when you try to run it it going to scew up so no i don't recemend it
4203	0	a	want to enjoy the game? buy the swagglicious overpriced cash item first.
10753	1	a	This game, allow me to give you a quick run down.  &gt;Spawn in game CTF because why not. &gt;Becomes Tech places two turrets down near the flag because racks up points and kills like a fat kid with candy. &gt; Gets bored repairing everything, jumps off the crossfire ships &gt;The Feels When going 210 Mph gotta go fast. &gt;Hits a hill perfectly grabs flag killing a brute in the process. &gt;Whips around and hits more hills going even faster &gt;Hits another hill and caps flag winning the game. &gt;The â¥â¥â¥â¥ When I get the nickname sonic.  10/10 would go fast again.
6851	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
8040	0	a	--This game is not F2P, you either pay for premium or don't bother--  APB Reloaded is a game that can be lots of fun but only if you buy a premium account...  I used the premium account trial and I had a great time playing as a criminal but when my trial ran out it immediately had huge effects on my game, most of my stuff became unusable and my best vehicle that I put loads of in-game cash into was turned into a pay wall.  This game has awful matchmaking, I was put into multiple matches against people who were three times my level and all they had to do was shoot me in the foot and I would die instantly.  If I was willing to buy a premium account I would probably like this game but the faulty matchmaking and dodgy reports about the developers will keep me far away from this game.
9609	1	a	this game is a mixture of awesomeness, and boringness while you have fun on your adventure of killing things you cant really do much more than trade and buy stuff. But if ur into this kind of stuff then this is the game for you. But if you are the type of person like me and love challenges then i suggest to you starbound it is the most amazing game its better than minecraft and terraria put together with it only being in beta
5059	0	a	it wont load up -_- 
9428	1	a	If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump.   Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section.   I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.  give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.
7341	0	a	Meh... if you can afford a subscription, it's pretty neat.  
10781	1	a	I really, really, REALLY liked this game. But it died off after Hi-Rez decided to sell out and focus on smite instead of updating tribes, this game had a lot of potential, but just wasn't to popular because of its difficulty and steap learning curve, i hope this game resurrects some day or that a good sequel comes out.  Edit: NEW UPDATE OMFG  Edit 2: Update was trash, they abandoned it for real now.
4614	0	a	Nice to see it's still broken as hell after 2 years.
3612	1	a	90% of the players are female in the game ofc
8026	0	a	What a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont play this game, the character creator is the only good thing about this game.
2306	1	a	I've played this game for upwards of three hundred hours, take heed. This could very easily turn into the most rage inducing game you have EVER played. Take a slot machine, shove inside a random number generator, and then draw a chance card from a Monopoly game and you'll know how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t the missions in this game can unfold. IF you don't take winning seriously, this games customization alone will keep you occupied.
3074	1	a	this is a fun action pack game it is hands down the best PvP game i have played on Steam.
7440	0	a	Just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as the first time this game came out.
7870	0	a	Good idea, bad execution. It was interesting at first having a GTA clone MMO but it was ultimately really boring with not a lot to do. To top it off, you only get a few days with a certain gun that you purchased with in-game currency, first time I saw that in a game and didnât like it.
4398	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
4180	0	a	Doesnt load crap, freezes up lots, slow loading screen
1973	1	a	Nice games
1214	1	a	could not make an accout 11/12
3340	1	a	THIS GAME IS GANGSTER
340	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
8322	0	a	After reading the reviews and having getting the game to launch I now cant even uninstall the damn thing. What POS, I do however recomend the other tittle by this pubisher Fallen Earth its very good 
3696	1	a	Just Awesome
7222	0	a	just stated after spending an hour creating my caracter there are only three servers with one being unusable  being in the us the only server close enough was a ue sever which was pumping out a ping of 158 not very good  then it took forever to get in the server 30min. after i got in no more that five minutes i get kicked.   in short this game is a wast of time and effort to people looking for a good game to play when no one is taking good care of it in the first place. its like they made it stayed with it and inproved it for a little wile and then abandond it.
2589	1	a	I And We Dance All Night To The Best Game Ever  OH DIDNT SEE YOU THERE THIS IS THE BEST GAME  IF YOU HAVE COOL COMPUTER XD
7539	0	a	It can be fun at first, but when you actually play it for a few days and try to make money get a decent gun. That's when the game starts to get boring, REALLY BORING. If you're playing as a criminal It takes hundreds of hours to make enough money, and theres a high chance that a cop might just come and bust you up then take all of your stash. There's a LOT of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in this game, and if you don't want to always rage like crazy. Then this is not the game for you, it is not worth your time AT ALL. One more thing, this is a completely pay-to-win game. Where the rich players one shot you, and you're there shooting like an idiot. Even when you start shooting them first from behind, they totally got enough time to turn around and shoot you in the face. Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE USING A FREE WEAPON. Don't play this game!
5567	0	a	Help this game always crashes on startup
5144	0	a	I put up with this b******* of a game for months i gave it a good chance I tried to make to seem good but as hard i tried this is a bad game,hackers Fairfight didnt do anythings this game tries to get u to open ur wallet more time that Steam Summer Sale (That is not possible though). If I had to Summirse i would say its a s***,broken version of GTA
5866	0	a	stay away from apb, unless you're a masochistic.
8766	0	a	how do i block a game from my viewing
262	1	a	Great game that requires alot of skill, Its a amazing game if you don't worry about a hacker here and there and dieing some! :D
8450	0	a	This game was once a great creation with loads of potential.  While still an addicting game that i feel has mastered the art of virtual 'cops and robbers' gameplay, it is sadly neglected all too often by the very company that is failing to keep it under their control.  The game is very poorly optimized, leaving it laggy at times to the point of complete unplayability, reguardless of how powerful your computer is. The amount of cheaters/hackers that roam is more than alarming and quite possibly the most i have ever seen in any game i have ever played.  The fact it is free to play also means that any cheater that is caught and banned can just make a new account, rejoin, and be back to cheating again in less than 5 minutes. The fact players know this leads to an ever growing population of cheaters. There needs to be a better form of anti cheat which not only bans a cheater/hacker but also prevents them from returning.   The gameplay within itself, however, is a lot of fun, mastering each gun is a unique challenge in its own.  Playing with friends can lead to tears of laughter, as long as you dont take it all too seriously anyways.  The character customization possibilities are endless and probably my favorite part about this game, theres just an infinite number of ways you can customize your character.  Servers are constantly getting ddosed by hackers anymore and G1 appears to care very little about anything at all except for farming money of their, more often than not, armas products. Gamersfirst? more like Moneyfirst. They feed the community lies and broken promises so often its a wonder how the company is even still running at all.  This game is AIDS, plain and simple. STAY AWAY!!!
7404	0	a	Does too Much Updating &amp; â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ -_-
1128	1	a	I made nazi uniforms for myself and friends, I then discoverd nazi iconography is now banned in the game. My friends and I pondered why this was so while standing on top of a burned-out car seeing who could shoot civilians at the greatest distance with the stock handgun.  I then saw a poster depicting one of the 'My Little Ponies' getting sodomized by a man, which is apparently ok to show in-game.  
4239	0	a	Unplayable. Reasoning?  - Quick Mode customizations will not load upon creating a character - Punkbuster kicks you out of your first match while doing the tutorial - Client fails to close and makes the Steam client believe APB is still running even with the game's processes' closed including Punkbuster
511	1	a	Hey guys, after a shÃ­tstorm of playtime I decided to give the community some of my toughts.  Obviously, we are talking about a game thats still alive after several years, and it has a reason, but I think this is about to be gone. Back in 2013 I stopped playing this game, and now in 2015 I gave it another go. I was dissappointed, not because it went worse or dead, it isnt. But there is no such new stuff that players were always dreaming of. More than a year gap, and I can say, nothing new, just some OP Armas Marketplace weapons, and a car kit. I was expecting at least a new vehicle, a roadmap, or at least hackers gone (and im not even that courageous to dream about a new district). Anyways, I hope once the server merge is done, devs will give attention to such a stuff like these, so now, I suggesting this game.  The pros: -Big community, you will always find buddies to play with, or get help. -Promo codes, I hope devs willing to keep provide them. -Open worlds with some gamemodes, and different servers for each (to make the matchmaker more fair). -Random and kinda colorful missions. Every mission is a different story. -Customization, including: music maker, car sound/kits/paint, Sims like character making+tattoos, and a lots of clothes...And this is the main point of the game, seriously, it has no pair. I would rather describe this game as a F2P art game with shooting possibilities. You can almost literally can customize everything, if you like designing, you will love this game. -Decent amount of perks/mods for cars/character/weapons, there is no best or worst set, everything depends on your playstyle. -Marketplace, where you can sell and show your badass stuff. Or buy. -Events. Make use of them, they are usually nice farming possibilities.  The cons: -Unbalanced weapons. Some of them that you can buy for real money, are obviously the way more powerful than those you can buy for in-game money, giving a p2w feeling. Still, you can try out some for free. -Server lags, not an usual problem, altough when it kicks in, you better just log off (I hope server merge will kill this). -Hackers. They will be always around with tasty aimbot and wallhack. FairFight is not enough to keep them away. -A lot of annoying no life as$holes, who like to harass others, even if they are on the same side. I just suggest ignore asap. -Weird car physics. They seem to be too slow and too heavy. -Designing possibilities are too limited with freemium account.  The two sided: -If you dont want to play missions, there is a possibility to hang around, race etc...That means of course, if you are on a mission, you still can get rammed and harassed by any other player. -Epic grinding. It keeps you playing, although without premium account its much harder to get money.  Tips for newbies: -Do the tutorial missions asap, look for the one that gives you a LIFETIME weapon. You will need it, you really dont want to re-buy your weapon every 10 days. -Spend some time at Social district and try out every editor. Also, thats the best place you can ask for help. -If you harassed by anyone 'superior' to you, just use '/report *name*' then '/ignore *name*', and if needed change instance. -Make sure you switched off auto-ready system, so you wont go on mission until you dont want. -Save money and joker tickets, dont spend them inmedetadly. -Always go for sure, check your ammo and grenades every time. -Just a performance tip, when you enter a district, take a trip from its end to the other, so most things will load, and you lower the chance of a performance lag.  I hope some of you can use it. If you have questions just ask. See you on battlefield!
9881	0	a	monotonous and boring. also a cash cow pay to win.
4396	0	a	What is it: APB reloaded is a small open world gta/saintsrow like cops and robbers free to play multiplayer game where you can create your character how ever you like race, gender, and features, and choose to be a cop or criminal with randomized missions to do with friends or random people and crash a van into stores and put all the goodies in the back of the van and sell it all to get money to get weapons, clothes, and cars.  What do i think: APB is a extreme pay to win money grabber after playing this game for a couple of hours i started to notice how repetetive it is once i started playing missions the missions started to repeat threres only like 10 missions i also found it a bit boring going back and forth with the van selling stuff to get money. and also my biggest pet peive with this game is that you cant buy weapons perminantly you are forced to rent weapons for a limited time only. and there are only at least 10 cars in the game i see cars repeat and repeat on the road like 4 of the same cars in paralell parking together.  Pros: - fun (but not for long) - good gameplay and driving handeling  Cons - dull and boring - small open world - no permanent weapons - repeating cars - not alot od missions - pay to win  The vertict: as much as a cool idea APB reloaded is it is a very boring money grabbing repetetive free to play game i am going to give APB reloaded a  RATING: 3/10

8022	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!

9680	0	a	Worst game i've honestly ever played in my life
6123	0	a	pay to win. you can get an early shot on a person but they will still kill you because they have faster fire rate and more accuracy. hitboxes are â¥â¥â¥â¥. when you shoot someone in the head you expect to kill them but no, all it does is deal the same amount of damage as a body shot

3196	1	a	Let me start off with the word: 'wow...'  This game has stolen so much out of my time. But in the good way of course!  I have played APB: R for a COUNTLESS amount of hours. I met tons of nice people, that I eventually have become really good friends with outside the game.   The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play! (the game died after a subscription model, but got brought up again)
9449	1	a	There is is thing i didn't know about this game im glad i found this out, its called......TRASH!!! UNINSTALLED
3139	1	a	ok if GTA met pc for free here it is you get to choose either crinimal or enforcer thats up to you the game is good but lag issues are a major issue
6271	0	a	Moneyfirst.
9474	1	a	Well wht can i say other than wow! ( no not world of warcraft ffs)   This game tests ur patience with some good old grinding, no not boring (NOTICE ''I SAID GOOD OLD GRINDING'') stop being negative already geez xD  So where was I... Oh yes! if u hav a brain and like sum crafting and sum action this game is soooooo what u need, if u have half a brain just pass coz this here is not for dumb people, ull hav loads of fun and the learning curve is easy and if ur really stuck u hav an online GM help line too :) which is helpful but dont go every 5secs n ask the same stupid SH*T coz ull get a full blast go play the game and figure it out a lil from a GM xD ( i totally agree with )  So u dont ask to be the best u learn to be the best thts final, the game is ruthless and nicely planned out, dnt go and expect to just get a vehicle lol u gta build 1 which is epic too coz hey the world is busted so scavenge get stuff and start with sum tyres and a frame etc etc ull hav the full reward of it in a good couple of hours :) so the crafting system is most awesome :)   Yes there is a few bugs etc but hey u ever played a bug free game that aint on console......? my point exactly  so give the game a whirl ull love it  8/10
5219	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I've ever played, and wasted money on, you have pistols that can out damage assault rifles and sniper rifles and if you want a good weapon you got to buy it with real money the ingame weapons they give you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this game has a lot of hackers. I can unload in a person with a good rifle and they won't die they hit me 3 times with a smaller gun or pistol I die. This game could be a lot better if it was balanced better and took better care of hackers. I play a lot of game and I'm fine with not being the best and dying now and then but come on, I even see people on the chat in game say how they are just gonna quit the game. I liked the game untill I kept running into the bs in the gameplay.
7228	0	a	$%#^ PUNKBUSTER! All i have to say!
7932	0	a	So, I played about two hours of this game. And instead of trying to break it down here's my pro/cons  PRO: Character generator is great. The Idea could be really fun.  CONS: The game itself, While it has good concepts, It ends up being glitchy, non-player friendly and the player base, at least for the Eastern NA server is dead.  Micro-Transactions, Like, Too many, there's not enough free-content for the game to hold itself up.  All and all, maybe if i got over the first few hours of play, it might be a passable game, but sadly, i don't see it coming up more than passable.
1889	1	a	best game its free and its for windows
593	1	a	Note: Don't spend money on this game. Don't interact with the community. Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the devs or the GMs. Just... Dont.  How to enjoy APB: 1) Make your character look awesome 2) Find some friends 3) Start using call outs and stuff so you are working together as a team 4) Play for fun do not play to win 5) Ignore the trolls  Follow these and you will love this game. Some of the best character customization in any game ever and it's open world take on mission based PvP is fun and makes the game feel different every time you play!
3281	1	a	this game is amazing... I was looking for a GTA substitute and this fit the bill and more. I mean GTA you cant ram things and raid it! but this game includes a lot of customization which is awesome to express what you like in VG's. but in general a good game for anyone
6316	0	a	  it is dog s.h.i.t u cant get rid of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ beard and than u click done then u pick the country u r in then the next button is â¥â¥â¥â¥ blanked out 0/10 will never play agian
4912	0	a	Before I re-installed the game through Steam I had been playing APB for more than 2 years. What caught my attention to the game, apart from the fast paced shooter mechanics, was the mind-blowing amount of customization, encompassing character, clothes, tattoos, cars, death themes, etc. This is, I think, the unique selling point of the game, as I haven't seen something so broad in terms of customization in any other F2P game. Some of the holiday events made by the devs were genuinely brilliant and my liking of the game eventually got me to spend some money to support the devs so they could fix the server issues, lagging, etc. Sure, since Day 1 one of my biggest issues with the game has been the considerable amount of toxicity, but then again the developers are not to blame. Oh, and the occasional hackers too... oh dear. But whatever, I loved APB.  Then the Fire Natio- sorry, the Server Merge happened (supposed to fix the lag).  For crying out loud, what happened?! More lagging!?  It's disappointing to see that most of the server issues, weapon balancing, severe lag, (add any other claim made by the players) haven't been resolved and instead G1 has focused on releasing re-skins of weapons in their insanely expensive Cash Shops. Now I am partially kicking myself for having spent money on the game, but I really hope that the devs can turn this game around and actually listen to the players for a change. Until then I'll keep playing APB (I spent a good amount of money in the game, so I might as well continue even if it pains me).
10407	1	a	Not too bad of a game.
10580	1	a	Wow! I was amazed when I first played this game. I hopped with one of my friends and I was in the action right away! I was reccomended it by one of my friends and I'm so happy that he did. It's like a mix of Star Wars, Halo and Call Of Duty. Although I had some promlems with the Hi-Rez Updater, the game is still up to speed and awesome.
5655	0	a	dont really see the point to the game, and dont plan on having too much fun unless you pay. graphics are pretty bad to boot
7496	0	a	the game stops responding when the game starts
916	1	a	This is the WORST game I have ever played. Every single problem you could have with a game, this right here caters to it. It has 20 minuite loading screens, more micro transactions than any game I have EVER seen, and lags to all hell. But it is some of the most amusing 15 minuites you will ever have with friends.
10791	1	a	Review time!  I will preface by saying that I have played this since beta and I am a huge fan of Tribes. And just because I want to have more people to shoot at, I'm going to recommend this game. I will go into flaws though and what some players who haven't tried this yet may want to keep in mind.  Tribes Ascend is a weird tiny beasty... It is a solid game overall, but frankly, HiRez dropped the ball pretty badly. They stopped development on this game completely. They did this in order to pour all resources on Smite, and despite doing something so 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' to a rather unique game that only needed a tiny bit of love they also ignored the cries to let the community mod the game. So this means that the main reason the older Tribes games are still around is totally non-existant here. There are no new maps, no new waepons and definitely no new updates coming.  What this means for new players is that they are pretty much getting a 'complete' game, whether the game itself is complete or not. This is not too bad, to be honest. I can't quite say that it is balanced, when it comes to weapons, and you will most certainly get wrecked by players who played this game longer but I think that is the charm. There are no totally overpowered weapons (even though the sniper rifles and some other weapons can get really annoying) and this is mostly down to how the weapons work. It takes time to get good enough with a weapon to even hit players. It takes even longer to get a Blueplate with a spinfusor (hitting a person in the air with a spinfusor weapon) or just hitting people with the automatic rifles. For me that's what the charm of the game is, there's a lot to do with how good you are at it.  Another thing to note is that this game is all about teamwork, you need people to defend your base, some to attack and disrupt the enemy defence, cappers to get the flag and chasers to chase the enemy flag carrier. Ofcourse, this is the optimal setup and doesn't always come into play on pub servers, but sometimes it does. And this is another charm of the game itself, if you are bad at shooting at people, then maybe try your hand at capping the flag. Or if you can't ski that great, can try vehicles or being a juggernaught bombaring the enemy base from far away.  All that is all good and well, but the fact that the game is 'dead' for the developer is a huge blow. And while I would recommend this to any player who wants a fast, skill-based shooter, I would also say that you might get pretty bored because there's no chance of anything new added or any of the totally crappy maps being changed for the better.

7423	0	a	The Devs are bunch of trolls... I'm done with this game. Give us the new Engine as you've promised years ago!! So Not Recommending this trash game. Don't play it... Spent your valuable time to somewhere else guys. You're welcome.
5630	0	a	Pay to win game
1522	1	a	The best mmofps game ever, really.  I agree to people saying 'game is ptw blah blah blah' BUT there are a lot of weapons already to choose which works very good, just you need skills, TBH didnt play this game for 1 year, then downloaded and i still had skill to be on top with 40 kills in a mission lol.  Matchmaking is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are always people matched in groups which has everything maxed out... This game would be the best if it didnt have threats... No gold, bronze or silver, because of this matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥, there must be only one order of ranks, like csgo, has and other mmo games.  Game is really competetive, and as i said, its the best one you will ever find as mmo fps as you can drive a car do some crazy stuff. I am running on pretty old pc sure using some low settings, but game is still having some laggs even people says that on even a gaming pc this game would lag, and im waiting for an update for engine... so yeah. Devs should look more into quality not into money.
4496	0	a	Gosh, this game is completely f*cked up! Matchmaking is utterly bulls*it. From the very beginning you need to play with highlevel characters and donaters. Donate, f*ck, it's terrible. It's not just 'pay to buy something faster than the others' it's completely 10000% Pay2Kicka*s. Customization in this game is just wonderful. It is the one reason why you should play this game, else DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
7876	0	a	I did not recommend this game it's Pay to win
5614	0	a	this game is not only pretty laggy also every vip guy who plays here they are impossible to beat them since they all have stronger weapons than non Vip people wich really makes me not even pay a cent to this game
610	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing
6875	0	a	Don't waste your time, people figured out how to speed hack, now you can't do anything about beating them. At least when it was just aim botting you could out smart them. Can't even boot them from your team unless they TK first. Fair Fight is a joke. Uninstalling.
6432	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!  I played this game at oringinal launch as well as after it was 'reloaded'. It was great! 3rd person shooter with EPIC customization. Very much enjoyed playing.  Now heres the only reason you need to never play this game:  My account was banned due to 'cheating witnessed by someone'. No cheating involved ever yet I was banned. Read around its not just me. Many others have had accounts banned for no reason at all. Spent all the time leveling up, getting cool things, customized everything only have have my account perma banned for having one good night where I was dominating the fight clubs.  Save yourself the hassel and just never play this game unless someone who cares takes over. If you are good then you will be banned. (I dont play this on steam but writing a review everywhere I can to help prevent this happening to others)
782	1	a	Fantastic Game. If you like the Saint's Row Serioes, you will absolutely FALL IN LOVE with this game.
8440	0	a	'Gamers First' Love the name, but you got it all wrong, its money first remember? or thats atleast all you show.
7285	0	a	Boring and repetitive, pay to win, and dominated by hackers.  Still fun to screw around in.
7918	0	a	It's fun without a doubt, but the player base is practically dead.  Any remaining players have the best gear and essentially gun down newbs or anyone at a lower level than them.
2206	1	a	Endless playing. Very dynamic. You can never get bored playing, theres lots to do
7230	0	a	This game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, getting dced every 30 min. bad match up, server is dead.
8817	0	a	When I heard about this game I was ecstatic. It was much before GTAV got out with online mode. I saw myself as a veteran criminal turning the whole city into a battlezone, making my money from extorsion to laundering and why not trafficking. HOW DISAPOINTED WAS I. People are WAY TOO FAST, getting a sniper shot in the head doesn't kill most of the time, and if you want to be decent, get your credit card out. Also, if you are a criminal, you can mug people on the street, it should get you far enough to buy a kitkat bar and some sweets. You can also try to ram a shop display to grab everything in it, you should end up with MUCH MORE, like, enough cash to buy yourself a new scarf. If you are a cop tho, ho ho ho, you are in for some pain. You get money from missions only. So if nobody is playing criminal on your server, you are bound to be a poor officer without enough cash to start your alcohol addiction untill the rest of your life. Even tho, you got cash, what next? Buy yourself a weapon, keep it 30 days and give it back. BUT YOU CAN CUSTOM YOUR CAR AND IF YOU ARE SKILLED ENOUGH YOU COULD MAKE PINGU ON THE SIDE OF YOUR CAR AND START THE NOOT NOOT PATROL. So yeah, if you want to stay alive, keep sprinting in ALL DIRECTIONS and hope for the dude to not have a VERY GOOD AIM.
3133	1	a	If you have some friends to play with, APB Reloaded gives one many hours of great gameplay. Unfortunately some decisions from the developers give a hint that developers' name 'Gamersfirst' leads to a false point of view.
3500	1	a	A good game, whit good graphics. I can say it's hard if you don't use gamers material, in the same time it's a P2W, but still recommanded for the people who have skills :)
1641	1	a	This game is so wonderful. Ive spent over 300 hours playing and i plan to continue to play for many many many more hours. The cheaters in the game? its nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. I only encounter 1 cheater every 60-100 mathces. Even then, they aren't ridiculously blanant and only have some sort of aim assistance, but you can still beat them if you are any good at the game. The game doesn't run the best, but they are working on a new engine and really want to have it up soon. If we got more people to come into all of these servers and get a little more revenue going towards the developers, we might actually see big improvements in this game. It has the potential to be an awe inspiring game that we play for years to come. I seriously recommend trying this game, the learning curve can be a little steep at first, but its nothing you cant get over. The community isn't always bad either, quite a few people are willing to help if you simply ask. Over all, one of my favorite all time games, i seriously recommend it
7511	0	a	This game is probably the best example of Pay 2 Win abominations. While the concept of the game is nice and the gameplay is pretty easy to get used to, it suffers from numerous very serious problems.  Graphics of the game is slightly above average. It doesn't really look bad, but you'll quickly notice that the optimization is rather flawed and the game is unstable and choppy.  When it comes to music, there are several radio stations to listen to, so you could say there's a bit for everyone. Even classical music, which was my personal favorite.  The gameplay itself is okay, but servers often crash and you'll have a hard time finding one that doesn't lag like hell. As I mentioned before, this is pretty much purely a Pay 2 Win game. While you earn some in-game cash to buy yourself new clothes, new cars and other stuff for your 'image', weapons can only be bought for about a week and then they disappear again. So you must either play 24/7 in order to earn enough, or just pay real money for that â¥â¥â¥â¥. And let me tell you - most of those pathetic kids do it. Stuff that you buy with real money is ridiculously overpowered, so you'll just end up angry playing against such no-lifers. The game is also swarmed by cheaters and nobody usually gives a damn about it, so they just keep cheating.  There is no story. You can either play as a cop or as a criminal. You fight each other in a number of game modes. All of them include shooting each other and some include car chases. You get thrown to the game without any tutorial, so you don't know what to do and you must learn the hard way. The community mostly isn't friendly, let alone willing to help you.  The best thing about this game is the customization. There's a wide range of clothes, colors and accessories. You can also create your own decals for both your car and your character. It's also important to mention that you get to create your character before you begin. You can change your face, but also your body. And options here have almost no limits.  What can I say? Despite its great customization options, good concept and fine gameplay, I can't recommend this game. All the fun you can have is quickly ruined by P2W people, cheaters, bad optimization, unstable servers and a very unfriendly community.
9752	0	a	Created an account, and it wont even let me log in. I tried my Steam username/password and the seperate account I had to create and both didn't work. Complete waste of time.
5076	0	a	9/11 Would uninstall again
7533	0	a	Well its fun and all but ever since the old verison of it got removed and the good graphics got removed into â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ones well it now sucks... :/ besides why they had to remove the styled 'choose your team' GUI and now its a basic one... And the menu instead of it having a criminal and cop its just a riot for the menu...
5800	0	a	After waiting for the game to download. I had to wait for another download which last around an hour every time i've tried to play. I havnt even been aple to play it yet, and i know its â¥â¥â¥â¥. DO NOT GET IT!!!
4819	0	a	This is a great game to play when you feel like putting a gun to your head and pulling the trigger. Very nice. :^ )
1185	1	a	its a game....
10445	0	a	Game is ALDI
548	1	a	This is one of my favorite games i know its pay 2 win but you can still have fun with friends making clothes, and symbols and you can do really many things like you can do in grand theft auto 5 but you got too have a pretty good pc
4470	0	a	It has been a while since I played, it used to be a fun game, but I was tired of lag on here due to the tech people not knowing what the hell they were doing and screwing it up more and more with each update. I was going to try it again as my brother had convinced me to play because they fixed all those issues. However, after 11 and a half hours of downtime today, far past the original estimate they gave, and with them expecting another 3 hours on top of this, I can clearly see that the programmers still cannot program properly and I feel I must give up on this game again before I was even able to give it a second chance.   Update: So I finally get to try this again... only logs me in every other attempt.. game decides not to render my enemies till there is already a bullet in my head... oh, and I absolutly LOVE having to wait for 5 minutes after closing the game to get control of my computer back. So in conclusion, it is still broken, the programmers obviously still don't know what the hell they are doing, and I'm done with it. Not worth the headaches that come with it. Such a shame, waste of a decent idea and semi decent gameplay. But that's what most free to play is, great idea smashed to â¥â¥â¥â¥ in practice.
9332	0	a	Hey lets put a help chat where the MOD's totally block everything you say bad about the game....played it for 45 min and they didn't allow anyone to say anything bad about the game.....let's just put it out there. It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....
405	1	a	I Just wish you could ride Horses.
10733	1	a	Absolutley fantastic. This is by far the fastest paced shooter I have ever played. Tribes takes a minute to get used to, but once you get down the basics of skiing, you end up having a blast. And it only takes a few rounds to get used to the physics. Tribes is one of those hidden gems, highly underrated. And there is nothing like the feeling of capping the flag at 250+ kph. Truly spectacular.
10063	1	a	Great game! EXCELLENT for role play and has the largest role play community Ive seen in ANY game. It's a huge open sandbox with endless quests and the most wonderful crafting system Ive ever experienced. Only issue maybe is end game play. There are no 'dungeon like' instances such as WoW has. Once you max lvl and max your crafting all thats really left is role play. I guess thats fine for role players lol! Anyway, its well worth playing. The only difference between P2P and F2P is crafting/harvesting/gathering speed but thats a pretty big difference considering how important crafting is in the game.
1400	1	a	FUN AS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HELL IGN 10/10
6445	0	a	I had quite a bit of fun when i played this game. Even setting aside the rampant, unchecked cheating. Or the people gaming the ranking system to bring their rank down from gold or silver to play on bronse.   What finally put me completely off was when i tried to use a controller. It completely broke the game for me. Even after i tried to go back to KB+M, there was some kind of glitch that made it so i was constantly turning to the left, and throwing grenades also fired my weapon.   When I tried to get support, both G1 and Steam said, 'not our problem, talk to them', and pointed at each other.
1742	1	a	Haters going to hate, people who gives this game a thumbs down have played this game for 1000hours and more lol. Game is fun, but many problems.
8485	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
7429	0	a	Although there are some stuff that makes it good, there are many things that make it really bad, outweighing the good. Where noobies (people who just start) are paired up with people who are much higher level than them, giving them a huge weapon/money disadvantage. And also the one thing I hate the most, the 'pay to win' aspect, where most of the uber items are only obtained if you pay for the game, by microtransactions, or any other way where you must pay to get items that can only be obtained by paying for it. Its ok to pay for items, as long as it doesn't break the game (Hats in TF2/ Vanity items). But if its 'Hey I want this uber weapon that dominates all other weapons that you can get by ingame currency' then it breaks the game.
3324	1	a	oh hi  nice game   i have 60R in this game :D
7774	0	a	I recommended this game it's all up to you Mr/Ms. steam User.Well although the time I spent in this game is not much but i can tell that this game is pretty much hard without paying with real life money.You have to get up and try to suceed with a tiny pistol and rifle and your policxe style Nissan Micra while other use muscle cars and vans with rocket launcher.It's hard to complete some achievements without paying plus you can't kill anyone that pay cash with your toy gun.
5532	0	a	Another p2w, pile of trash, only this time, its the revival of the fastest mmo to ever be shut down. Thats always a beacon of confidence.

9232	0	a	WHOOO, EVERY FUN THING IN A GAME: Slow annoying movement, Crappy Ai's, Glitches, Crappy jump, Crappy mission system(its glitchy), Press Y to interact? Most games is press E, Crappy dailog box(it glitches...), Crappy skills.  Well, if ou like that crap ^^^ then this game, still isnt for you... its really that bad, don't play this game.
2909	1	a	APB is an awesome Cops and Robbers game pitting player against player in a fight to control the city. The high customization, as well as the firefights and car chases ensure this game will be high on your favorite games list. 8.5/10
1651	1	a	It ok
10531	1	a	I unlocked the Technician class and i went to test it, I repaired the generator and everyone called me a tryhard and to kill myself... 11/10 Would repair again.  Ok lets get to the point  Pros: -Amazing skiing mechanic -pretty good guns -nice variety of classes -really fun vehicles  Cons: -Developers sort of left it for Smite -Maybe its just me but the guns seem to feel a bit weak, the guns are strong but there just isnt much feel to the guns  EDIT: The developers honestly didn't really affect it that much with Smite coming along, it is still a great game.
3360	1	a	Good game, but requires a VERY good computer to run. I found this out the hard way, as it crashed about every 30 mins.
3147	1	a	APB Reloaded has been retuned since it's initial relaunch and the game has a lot to offer. Not a perfect title, but worlds better than it used to be and very fun with tons of customization. No PvE, the game is entirely PvP so be prepared.
4304	0	a	Customization is really good and can spend hours just making your character. Downside is the gameplay and lack of playerbase now, it's slowly dieing. Massively Pay2Win, you can beat every player with paid guns though, if you're looking to put effort into a dead game.
1660	1	a	'I just wanna know how it feels, ya know, realizing that you're trapped in a situation where you are just losing control of the city.'  'That's a matter of opinion.'  'Opinion? Yea there's your opinion and then there's the truth.'  'Any comment on the nightmare Darren graffiti I see all over town these days? Aren't you worried you might have a public perception problem?'  'I don't worry about what criminals are writing on walls DicÄ¸. A safer San Paro, that's what I promised at the election, that's what I'm delivering.'  'The City Security Act, that's your big idea huh? Giving every yahoo out there a license to roam the streets armed.'  'We need people willing to fight fire with fire.'  'All you've done is create legalized vigilantism. Now we have competition, we have Golds provoking Silvers and the Silvers are taking it out on the whole damn Bronze District!'
3266	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
2307	1	a	you should play even if you have no time!
6244	0	a	I have put many hours into this game, and it is extremely fun. However just like Blacklight: Retribution, very pay to win and lots of hackers. I still love this game, however you will probably not.
9018	1	a	A very good FPS game. Graphics are decent, and the mechanics and skill paths are virtually endless.  My one problem with it, however, has to be the endless grinding involved.
3535	1	a	You can still get money for them big ole heavy tvs' from the shop! I think the games time frame is first nokia phone thru right before flat screen tv.
4226	0	a	It's lame and it;s keep kicking me :[ P Please help ;[
8765	0	a	I don't recommend this game for a number of reasons  1. Takes a hour and 1/4 of a hour just to set it up and play the damn game  2. Vey laggy, laggiest game I ever played on Steam  and 3. The loading times, are so damn slow!
2925	1	a	I love this game ! You must to try it &lt;3
1836	1	a	WTF happed? 
10135	1	a	This is definitly a niche game but if you like games that do not hand everything out to you and have a steep learning curve this game is for you. Barely any useful quest rewards, if you want something you have to go out farm for mats and craft the items yourself or pay someone else to do it. Beautiful graphics and fpslike gameplay seal the deal. Definitely not for everyone, but those who it is for it is a hidden gem.
9254	0	a	this game sucks mega â¥â¥â¥â¥
277	1	a	So I decided I was going to get this game. Then I relized that I already owned it. oops.
7996	0	a	APB Was A Fun Game Until Getting Into The Salty Horrifying Community... Just dont get the game.
8969	1	a	Its alright if a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... to many player couples that too socially anxious to talk to real girls and guys....
10549	1	a	Online FPS on speed. I can spend hours getting horrible K:D ratios and still have fun with the physics. AND IT'S FREE!! Just get it!
8496	0	a	This honestly has to be the most nonsensical game Ive ever played. The gun damage makes 0 sense whatsoever. You hit a guy with an AK 15 times and he survives, and he shoots you 3 times with a pistol and you die. Whoever is defending is guaranteed to win every mission. I havent won a single mission where Im not defending, and havent lost a single mission where I am. This games 'skill' is purchased in the form of better equipment, that you cant buy until youre a high level. #hide2win
8928	1	a	Well i played 5.3 hours but i'm already a fan. This game is nuts. I love this!!! 
4746	0	a	It's a p2w. If someone has spent some money in this game, and he is in the enemy team,you are so dead. I don't like how when I started to play,Proffesional players was killing me nonstop in missions. I spent total of 910+ hours.        FFS Make this game play to win not pay 2 win. .I.
7504	0	a	Went and played this game for 20 minutes, lags like sh*t and gives me a punkbuster kick within 5 minutes. -&gt; DELETE
7723	0	a	Other than the really good customization features. You are up for a sketchy game. By sketchy I mean, there is no anti-cheat system, nor is there a proper 'Report abuse' feature. They don't care who or what you think is hacking. They just do whatever to buff or debuff weapons and more. The guns and most of the other features are locked unless you have premium. It's one those F2P games where you have to buy Premium in order to get the most out of a game. Of course, most games do the same, but for this game, Premium statuses make the game unbalanced. (This is my opinion and expressing why I wouldn't recommened the game).
4764	0	a	This game just will not behave. I made an account before I downlaoded it, launched it and logged on useing the account I made. Then it said it was invalid, so I made another account, and THAT did not work, then a third, and months later I downloaded it again, useing all three acounts to login with, and all of them were invalid. It is still like that, and I did not get an email for my roblem yet when I sent in a report, so I do not reccomend this game...
7200	0	a	Wont even load past the launcher. APB NUMBER 1! YOKOZUNA NUMBER 1! AH-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! *furious nodding*
7925	0	a	Nice grafic, nice idea, but horrible balancing (no balancing) and 100% Pay2Win! If u wanna spend all u'r money, play it! if not, let it be...!
4099	0	a	Let me tell you something about huge problem with F2P games... PAY 2 WIN players 
10821	1	a	Happy that the game is back 
3808	0	a	This game is an unbalanced piece of trash, don't bother with it. Customization options are truly amazing which is sad because everything else is full of crap. Came back after a year and it's still the same. Only new content is pricey premium weapons and other stuff. Uninstalled and never coming back.
6491	0	a	This game is NOT noob friendly. in APB reloaded, there is no sign of matchmaking whatsoever. it just compiles a random clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of people to duke it out. which means if you're just starting out, you could easily be placed against someone who's been playing nonstop for months repeatedly. I tried to get on my feet in that game for 3 days, but every cent I earned went toward ammo or was lost in deaths to people who play nonstop and pay actual money for the good equipment.   also, I dare say that this is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. even more so than Call of Duty. I don't get angry easily, but this game angered me to the point where I threw my mouse across the room and shattered the damn thing. So, here's a warning. if you're angered easily, AVOID APB RELOADED  It's a shame, because the idea behind it had a lot of potential. I was really excited to see someone finally making a game like this where you could actually be the cop with custom cars and weapons. It had so much potential, but the absolutely terrible matchmaking and blatantly obvious pay to win strategy ruined the entire thing for me.  long story short: unless you're willing to spend an untold amount of hours on this game, all it's going to do is infuriate you. it's a gigantic avoid from me.
607	1	a	Great Game, Great Graphics.
7509	0	a	bad and very hard to see whats going on
1555	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fantastic

2279	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
8211	0	a	Used to be addicted and I used to never stop playing. It used to be fun, but the same can't be said.   Now, its a pay 2 win with a 'Rent System' and its a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to get prestiged.  I wish I could go back in time to enjoy how this game used to be.
5000	0	a	Good game, I liked it.. then they ballsed it up. I can barely if ever get it running, and when i do. it stops in the 'world Loading' part.
827	1	a	If you want a game that gives you a raging hardon all the time no matter what, get this game. I should probably get this checked out by my doctor..
3673	1	a	I love this game. But there is lots of hackers playing it. So that is the bad side of the story ;) If you are playing as a cop you are cool, because it's not that easy. But if you are the robber then it's just too easy and it's just boring. Believe me. It's a good game. :D (PEACE)
6404	0	a	This is the kind of game that goes goes Full â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
324	1	a	Great Game, a FEW!!! back hackers though, still a fun and game i would highly recomend to try or even to get addicted to!
9212	0	a	Very idiot Logic,some enemy can hit you with 10 m with an axe,or when you pass them with a motorbike,ythey will hit you with a small knife from 50m...very buggy,and the premium boxes worth nothing
5306	0	a	This game would be really nice if it wasnt pay to win i mean why do i have to pay money for an ingame gun 40$?I can buy better stuff with that
3585	1	a	Only punched me in the nuts twice, pretty okay experience.
9594	1	a	10/10
8129	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ makes brink look like a well made, complete game  'mostly positive'
4245	0	a	This game is one of the worst games on steam. Sure, I have 19 hours. That's 30 MINUTES of actual playtime and the rest is the game being frozen and buggy. DO NOT GET THIS GAME. WASTE OF HARD DRIVE SPACE.
1593	1	a	this game is amazing cant get over the fact that it is free GET IT NOW BEFORE IT IS NOT FREE its like gta 5 and cops and robbers ignore the haters they just make the game look bad, so before you do anything else get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3022	1	a	i wish i could play it all i get is a black screen and i can see the main menu flashing.......i think
726	1	a	Good game - Best customization ive seen on any game, can be really good way to pass time and be quite a fun game, other times it can be extremely annoying or laggy as hell. It's very hard for new players to start this game as it is very pay to win, but if you can deal with it, it is an enjoyable game
9671	1	a	Fallout 3 Online.
9586	0	a	What the hell is this game.
5273	0	a	A waste of time and money.....  I played this game originally... Just after it launched as a F2P release. Spent around $35USD to unlock some premium gear.  Took a break for a while due to life intervention, work, work, work, etc.  9 months (and change) later.... The game is crap, driving mechanics are worse than EVER, and the overall gameplay mechanics are utter JUNK!  Keep away from this turd, its stench will just make you vomit all over your keyboard.
263	1	a	Probably one of my top 5 favorite MMORPGs. I played it back before it became 'Reloaded'. Simply has all the features a MMORPG needs. THEN IT ADDS GUNS! It is a TAD bit repetitive though. Only complaint. I would place it in the top 20 all-time-best list.
4829	0	a	eh. its like gta but pay to win.
4597	0	a	The game is a cheat fest at this point, and the developers do nothing about it. I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you're a revenge hacker.
1154	1	a	Great game.
9046	1	a	makes me want to do heroin and become a lesbian  10/10
6654	0	a	dont get this. here is what you should get instead from best to worst: 1) GTA V 2) GTA IV 3) Saints Row 3 4) Saints Row 4 5) GTA San Andreas 6) GTA 3 7) GTA Vice City 8) Saints Row Gat Out Of Hell 9) Just Cause 2 10) Just Cause 3 11) Goat Simulator 12) Borderlands 2 13) APB Reloaded this game is not wroth your time. it is a very nice games but so many other open world games are just so much better with so much more content.
5745	0	a	This game is fun if your 12.
9812	0	a	Crash Simulator 2011
2124	1	a	10/10 would f*ck sh*t up again.
6119	0	a	This game is like cancer, I wouldn't even wish my worst enemy to play it. The game is trash so don't even bother.
6245	0	a	It's a pay to win game, or with extreme skill or hacks you will be able to live through a whole mission without dying.  3,5 out of 10 would bang if i was forced to.
9705	0	a	Sucks just sucks if you want a better game get Unturned Its F2P and its way better
9650	0	a	Ive seen more functional trailer park families than this game.
1114	1	a	It kills you from the inside
8863	0	a	This game is dead. You can try it, but DO NOT spend money on it.  Bottom line, AbandonWare.
696	1	a	Just a good game ;)
3142	1	a	i would really recommend this game for players of the crackdown and crackdown 2 xbox 360 games because there really alike 
2668	1	a	APB (All Points Bulletin), the first online game developed by David Jones, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is a massively multiplayer online game based in living, breathing cities that will feel familiar to players, as they precisely replicate famous cities all over the world. APB is a turf war involving two main factions, the Squads, whose goal is to uphold the law, and the Gangs, who seek to break the law at all costs. Players will be able to choose their side, in a classic good guy versus bad guy scenario.
8557	0	a	This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing freezing and crash more 20 times and my pc specs is recommed system requirements from steam and why my game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crash more 20 times and why developers didn't fix this developers only update a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clothes and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gun right !?

3679	1	a	  this game much fun   
10512	1	a	Tribes: Ascend   Shortly, 10 jetpacks out of 10.
8653	0	a	run away before its too late
2334	1	a	i cant seem to load it up 
3163	1	a	This game used to be an ultimate battle of Good vs. Bad. When it first came out, you would log into a world of chaos as criminals and enforcers were shooting, driving, looting, and running everywhere. The experience of logging in and knowing what was awaiting me was a thrill. When it became free to play, I returned to it and had the same excitement going in. Now, it seems the game has begun its decline. You have to be lucky to find a decent amount of people online and when you do they are mostly criminals. It has basically became an online single player game which makes the missions feel very repetitive. Even though this is a negative I have with the game, I personally dont think it's the game's fault. The game is still fun to play, the missions are fun if you have someone to play them with, and the customization of clothing and vehicles in APB is amazing. If you havent played this game before, I strongly suggest giving it a try.
3379	1	a	played for 10 minutes.  10 minutes trying to get the game to launch 0 playing  10/10 launcher simulator
8844	0	a	nothing changes...poor graphics and servers lagging like hell ,, but i've good memories with this game :/ was fun but i don't play it anymore :/.
10506	1	a	Great, but dead game.
4414	0	a	I played the Beta and even bought it when it was initially released and I loved the game and it was a huge disappointment when the company went under. I was obviously ecstatic when I heard the game had been picked up and re-released but I hadn't really played until recently. Now it's just crap. A clear case of pay-to-win. I've seen cash users shot in the head multiple times with a burst fire rifle and survive, taken direct grenades and survive, seen their cars getting loaded up with Alig and grenade fire and survive. Then on the flip side I've seen just one of their grenades take out a vehicle, kill someone by just being near the blast and destroying people from long range with an uzi type weapon.   I'm not totally sure what happened to this game but it has no real balance from what I witnessed and have been hearing. I am also aware of a lot of promises that players were given for new content and then not fulfilled. Kind of seems like this game is just here to suck in peoples cash dumb enough to pay at this point. Oh, What could have been :/ R.I.P APB 
5075	0	a	Don't even download this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. It's a waste of time and space. 0/10
6342	0	a	PAB for mei s crap it wont even launch me to the game it looks like fun but I am not sure about that
1645	1	a	Very cool game :)
4222	0	a	I'd review it if we could actually even play it!! The log-in process on this game is awful. My son, who just got his first lcomputer, downloaded it and was feeling jaded so I downloaded it and was doing no better than he was. I mean, have you ever actually gotten a person who knows nothing about the game to give it a test? All I know is that we followed the instructions and the f-ing thing wouldn't work.
7146	0	a	Used to be addicted and I used to never stop playing. It used to be fun, but the same can't be said.   Now, its a pay 2 win with a 'Rent System' and its a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to get prestiged.  I wish I could go back in time to enjoy how this game used to be.
3290	1	a	Overall a good experience when you are high level in the game and you are playing with 3 friends using VOIP, But now ever since the game switched to Steam, Its been riddled with hackers.  The game is about tactics, But new players don't see that part, They just run and shoot like CoD players.  The game is highly customisable, And has a wide variety of clothes and character attributes. You can be any character you'd like, Just re-create it, Takes some time, But its nice.  If you'd like to give it a try, I recommend it, Its free after all, But don't play alone.
10067	1	a	Bigest Crap ever! Don't waste your Time.
6984	0	a	Pretty difficult to get a formidiable gun without paying money.
1042	1	a	Not bad, Needs to Update the Graphics settings.
8491	0	a	optimized like â¥â¥â¥â¥, boring and unfriendly to new players, half of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is locked behind paywalls and the other half will take you 3 weeks straight of the same boring â¥â¥â¥ PVP to get 
2699	1	a	its the best better than tf2
4067	0	a	Worst game in existance. Freezes and Crashes constantly, Hackers everywhere, Laggy, Glitchy, and a complete Clone of GTA  EDIT: It's also pay to win, the devs are money vampires, they suck the money oudda ya' wallet!  I would give this a 3/10 at least the graphics are nice, but that doesn't matter because it won't even let me frickin (YOU FREAKING FRICKS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN) move and then freeze and crash..
2399	1	a	kinda bad graffics but good game play
1452	1	a	QUICK RANT, PROS+CONS BELOW  The game is good, really good. I love it. BUT SWEET MOTHER OF GOD DOES PUNKBUSTER SUCK â¥â¥â¥â¥. 1st hour of 'playtime' - trying to get Punkbuster (APB's anti-cheating system) to work and not throw errors in my face; 2nd hour and the first half of the 3rd hour - having extreme fun, loving the game so much; the rest of my 'Playtime' - trying to get Punkbuster to work again, but I give up.  I really don't know why any game uses Punkbuster. From my experience, all games with Punkbuster have extreme amounts of bullcrap regarding being able to play (APB just confirms that once more). I'd love to recommend this game, but hell, I barely got to play it. And I will definitely not waste more time on it.  Pros+  *Really fun to play, there is just so much freedom *Has that GTA 5 feel to it - not exactly it, but something of it's own *Obtaining standart currency (cash) is pretty easy, fast and painless, so it shouldn't take you more than a couple hours (MAX) to obtain a new piece of gear *The difference between being a premium or free player is simply progression speed - and both are pretty close together to each other  Cons-  *As stated in my rant, it uses the Punkbuster anti-cheat. It throws up so many false flags that it's even pepe-worthy. That'd would be a really â¥â¥â¥â¥in rare pepe tho...I gotta make that now *Some guns are just straight up better than others, and there's nothing you can do (only exception being your and your enemy's reaction times - that alone can sometimes kill you or the enemy) *It appears that headshots are not a thing in this game. Heads have no model, so good aim isn't rewarded all that much. As an FPS vet, this seems really weird to me  CONCLUSION  This game is great beyond 'it shows potential', it is so much fun even if you're alone (with friends, it is CONSIDERABLY more fun though), but Punkbuster and some minor balance issues are holding this game down. If you have a pretty good computer and Punkbuster doesn't drown you in errors, I can GUARANTEE you'll enjoy this game (at the very least).
10409	0	a	Very freaking bad video card wise and ill tell you how it completely crashed my PC that's how!!!
3189	1	a	If im being completely honest here, it's one of the most exciting games ive ever played. Yes At low levels and if you dont purchase items for the sellers it's quite hard to win missions but even the basic details like driving and looting bring a smile to my face
7172	0	a	F4ck This Game.
8507	0	a	its like a horrible version of GTA SA ONLINE.
7235	0	a	Can't even launch the game anymore. Tried every possible fix or workaround. Reinstalled 3 times.
9628	1	a	is very cool game!!!!!!! BRO!!!!!!!!! 
9580	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥.
7803	0	a	Really Bad Game i Played 2 Years And after I retired APB... After a year Today The im Trying to Get into My Account that i had And in-game i Typed my Email Address And My Password After That i waited for while And its wrote me that im Not to Old To Play APB.... And after That i asked For Help in the Gamers First Forums And they Just told me: 'To get out of here your not old enough to play this game.' really Shame And Bad Game it was Great Expiriance But now Bad Game Not Reccomended... 
7898	0	a	It is a pain to download!
534	1	a	If you can get past the lag spikes, and the occasional hacker. This has to be one of the best open world MMO/PvP games I've ever played. The customization in this game is brilliant. It is still a very much work in progress as far as games go, but it gets better and better.
1437	1	a	APB Is a game with endless thought of makeing cars, people ect. The only thing crappy about the game is the lag i cant stand lag but i get used to it everthing else is perfect! 11/10
8571	0	a	Never play this game... I've played it nearly since 2011 but the game is always sucks. So many hackers and owners of the game just cares about your wallet. Bad.
4024	0	a	I like this game, don't get me wrong. It's fun and fast, very customizable and good to play in groups.   The biggest problem with this game, however, is the playerbase. You will be hard pressed to find a more venemous and hateful crowd of online personalities anywhere else. Frequent 'hackusations' and minors screaming over the VOIP service. Griefers and exploiters are also abound, this game brings out the 'do anything to win' in a lot of people.   There is also a form of racism in the game against anyone who is not a gold leve player, and then in the reverse, anyone who IS a gold player. This game is also plauged by a group of people who were probably banned for cheating or something, that come back to crash the servers and generally cause everyone else to be unable to play the game.   This game has a very steep learning curve, but once you get it, you spend a lot less time getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at your pixels and more time having fun... but not a lot more.
2227	1	a	Amazing customization GTA like gameplay online anarchy i love this game!
732	1	a	The game is fun and has many hours of gameplay. Interesting and detailed customisation. However can have moments with bad match making.
6004	0	a	The game lags like crazy. The graphics in the game are way lower quality than showcased in the trailers. And also its impossible to find objsctives as there are no waypoint markers.
5037	0	a	It's p. bad in like, every way, I only play sometimes because my idiot friends want me to and theyre good company, despite terrible taste in games.
750	1	a	Ok heres the thing i'ts sort of like those games or toys thats a less a good version of something good. Sort off like a off brand, if you can't purchase Gta or Sleepingdogs or any open world games than play it. That's why its free I can't say its bad beacuse its free and it really doesnt matter. I like this game but its far off from anything close to a open world crime game. So heres what I rate it a 4/10 depends on which player you are. I would still just get it if you wan to have a little taste of a Open World Game.
5522	0	a	Fun untill you loose Premium ;_;  Im not paying for that.
835	1	a	Love this game!!! Its sooo cool! BEST GAME EVER! YOU SHALL PLAY IT!!!!!!
5975	0	a	  I've played League of Legends and its community isn't as toxic as APB's community. Download this game if you're rich and want to spend a hella ton of money on this game, if you're not then you're better off downloading another game.  Sure this game can be fun but there's always a gold player that's going to anally â¥â¥â¥â¥ you with his grenades and cars.  But if you ignore all its faults and its rabid and toxic community, APB is a good game that is worth your while. Even if it's for a little bit.
2607	1	a	Great Game with the best Customization I've ever seen . But you also need a lot of money to get everything you want. And its also kinda pay2win .... Theres many more which could be improved .
5292	0	a	This game originally failed because of core problems that existed in the game and the complete ineptitude of the developers (when they were Real Time Worlds) to fix or at the very least alleviate these problems.  Now on top of those issues you have an utterly broken cash shop system that will ruin your experience 95% of the time.  To start I should address some of the original problems that plagued the game on it's original releaes, guns were (and still are) terrible to use and the application of modifications does not make that any better. The gunplay feels clunky and the recoil on most weapons make it impossible to hit anything less than 5 feet infront of you. that is unless you use specifc weapons.  Cars are in the same boat as guns, for a cops and robbers MMO, you think they would be able to get the driving down. This is not the case. The car physics are terrible and they don't control that great either.  The mission system is absolute garbage, you can follow through multiple objectives, winning one after another. but if you fail the final one (, you will instantly, ignoring the fact taht you and your side were dominating the opposition;; fail the entire mission (And I find this happens more for the enforcer faction than the criminal faction, in all my time playing). This is further problematic with the addition cash shop weapons.  Now your thinking: Wow, hopefully the new developer and publishers would of picked up this game up and would of tried to fix these issues, which while do not make the game unplayable, do not provide an enjoyable experience for prolonged periods of time.  Well, no. They ignored these issues.  And I haven't even mentioned the games instability, poor performance even with modern hardware. or the failure for the game to completely shut-down once your done playing (One of the processes used in the game will ALWAYS STAY UP).  What they did bring to the game. was one of the worst things they could of done. They added a cash shop for guns, no no, not cosmetics. these guns have an actual performance advantage over other guns that you can actually aquire through gameplay.  These wonderful items provide superior damage, little to no recoil in addition to some other effects they can provide.  This damages the poor mission matchmaking and balancing because if your enemy team has these weapons, and you don't well, your screwed. in laymans terms.  Now to be fair, the new devs have actually added some content in the game with the addition of the 'Chaos district' and in game events. These aren't that great though, they aren't even the quality of the RTW content (Which isn't that great either), and the events are hampered by people rampantly cheating. Which I forgot to mention, is incredibly commonin this game (from outright use of hacks, to exploiting faults with the game or going out of bounds.)  the only positive thing I can say about the game is it's customisation system. and, unfortunately ,that hasn't seen any improvements since release of the ORIGNAL release. There is very little added to customise yourself since then (that that which is added is cash shop items -- go figure.) and while the emblem creator is nice and all that, if you don't have the ability to use it (since you cannot import emblems and pictures, you use geometric shapes to create them) thats just a wasted feature, and you will be dependant on the auction house to find anything you want. Which is ALSO an issue since people find it prudent to sell their crap for stupid huge amounts of money, and you can't filter or search by name of what your looking for. so if you want anything past 'T' for example. be prepared for LE EPIC TROLL FACE MEME XDDD!!! for the next 40 pages.  To sum this up: If your looking for a GTA MMO, this isn't that. go play GTA instead, if your looking for a fun Free-to-Play game, this Definitely isn't for you. becuase this game is by no means 'Free' and it's not fun either. I tried to cover everything I experience in my time playing this game, I probably missed something that would make me go for another 5 paragraphs. so it's best to stop here.  TL;DR: Games â¥â¥â¥â¥, p2w garbage. devs don't give a crap about the game and army of cheaters, go play some other game.
6497	0	a	This game makes Hitler looks innocent .
10218	0	a	This game is dogshite. Graphics suck, lag out the â¥â¥â¥â¥, long install time, not at all what was advertized. Controls clunky and enemies are stupid. This is a barely held together string of flawed code.
968	1	a	my playtime consists entirely of updating
3903	0	a	It sucks. It's Pay to Win so everyone is able to kill new people instantly.
10228	1	a	great game to play for hour or sokill stuff get horsess and atvs it's prety sweet
1336	1	a	its not a bad game.....
8633	0	a	I downloaded the game when me and my friend wanted to play a game with some entertainment value. Kinda hard to find that when everyone is teleporting right next to you while you are shooting at them from across the street.  This is what I get for trying â¥â¥â¥â¥ games again...
7500	0	a	I hate this game! Everybody you come across seems to be a much higher level than you with lots of game experience and awsome weaons, as for me, I only just started and got anihalated by averyone. They all had rocket launchers and grenade launchers, all I had was a pistol and SMG!
6916	0	a	Steer clear from this game. It is Pay to win.
7041	0	a	To much error's.
1488	1	a	I recommend that you do not play this game.
132	1	a	50 Cent: Blood on the Sand
296	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FAUHKOING AWESOME! TRY IT! LOVE IT!
162	1	a	At first glance, APB Reloaded seemed stagnant and dry, like the barren tundra of a retired â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'s once fertile ravine. The experience was shallow and the sense of accomplishment was too few and far between, leaving the uncertainty that a virgin feels after what may have been an instance of date â¥â¥â¥â¥ ; could one even call that a victory at all?  Now, standing at the frontier of this outlaw's paradise, I find myself wondering : am I playing this game, or is this game playing me?
709	1	a	Good concepts, bad executed  GG   10/10  no playorino too shiterino
4933	0	a	When i played this game... i just felt it was unfair in a ton of ways. Also, huge random Lag spikes, when i'm at 60fps.. Just suddendly drops to 2fps then back to 60fps. I don't know why it does that, but it's mainly caused by Explosions...
3346	1	a	Yea, this game, its addictive, yep. You start, then you don't finish. This. Game. Is. Addictive. So if you want to have a life, have friends, and not think crazy thoughts, don't play this game. Yea. Yes.
5602	0	a	One day, i am looking around in the Freeplay section of Steam, trying to find a good game me and my brother can play, at the moment, i have a 2008 high-end gaming PC, and my brother has a 2014 Hasee Gaming laptop. I am outstanded, the trailer makes the game look brilliant, the graphics are amazing, the customization is crazy! It's like the best fruit-smoothie ever. Insane cars, crazy firefights, i thought i'd just struck gold! I rush to the download button.  *SOME TIME LATER*  The game is still installing, i rush over to my brothers PC, and i love the look of the game already!  *15 MINUTES LATER*  dx11.dll was not found. It says in the requirements, dx 9 is required to play it, as a minimum.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this.  
2999	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this with The Respectable Gentlemen Crew on Guardian Server. Lots of great times and laughs. 10/10 would play again.
212	1	a	It's nice game!
4281	0	a	apb reloaded is a game for people who like 3rd person shooters, if i were you i would get membership becuase you make money faster and also unlocks more. You can play without membership but takes alot longer to make money and get things. The maps are fun to explore but the mishions are for the most part the same:( if you have GTA 5 and you think its the same you are wrong its alot different, if you wanna be a cop it takes longer to make money i learned that the hard way... be a robber/enemy what ever you like to call it lol just my opion. BUT the game is mostly PAY TO WIN if you have no money RIP if you do spend it.    10/10
893	1	a	RIKKAYBOBBAY APPROVES... I WANNA GO FAST AND GARBAGE BOMB YOU WITH MEATBALLTONY
9391	1	a	the naked caterpillar. what more do you want from a game?
6228	0	a	This game is so terribel. i have played for alot of years, on my other account wich is some times ago, and i tried it again on this account. And it was impossibel to play.  The game is so unbalanced its insane, if you are new you will get rekt to pieces and you will never have a good experience with this game. This game is so badly optimized that you will have to have the best pc in the world playing this game good. I have an okay good pc but i still get FPS shatters.   Costumazation is kinda good, the prahics isnt that good so it will not really look good. Alot of pieces of clothing you have to pay for, unless you just want a kinda boring persona.   Cars in this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed, alot of times they will glitch out. and havning lag and driving is like dont drink and drive, and there is alot of p2w cars you can buy.  Weapons are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, use 20 bucks and you can get a account permanent gun, that you can use from level one. Even tho alot of the P2W ewapons are just looks of other guns, its still a waste of time using money on them. And not minding the joker boxes wich are boxes you can 'unbox' and get weapons/cars   At last. I WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME!!!. Play this if you want to use 1000 hours learning to not mind, bugs and other stupid flawes that are in this game...... Sad to see such a good potential game, getting wasted multiple times over and over again. I would go som far to say if EA realeased this game, it would be better........  
7073	0	a	worst game ive ever played, the trailers look amazing but that is nothing like the game DO NOT DOWNLAOD 
6093	0	a	I really liked it. I was able to get kills in some cases. But it's Pay2Win. Gotta admit it. It's not an actual F2P game so, misleading tags?
9551	0	a	If you like to RP then this game is for your for everything else go find a different game. The Devs have no idea how to develop a video game and most of them ended up quiting anyways there is like 3 developers left.
4350	0	a	  This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥!   This game is made to suck money from their players. The company doesn't fix things they just release more pay to win content, The game is a great idea and since its a great idea and sometimes has great matches it makes you want to play it more, But in the long run just uninstall it and leave it be and wait for a better APB.  
639	1	a	Its sow funny whit frends
9668	0	a	its dump, cofusing, and it has the worst grapics and it takes for ever to load. 
3449	1	a	This game is badass to play in multiplayer
9639	1	a	very addicting game
8351	0	a	Major hackfest + pay to win in every way possible, it used to be a great game but the devs got greedy... avoid at all costs if you wish to keep your sanity in check.
4693	0	a	How-to-beat-hackers simulator at its best.
6523	0	a	Never spend money on a free game. If you download this, you'll either have to buy your gear or spend hundreds of hours trying to keep up with the frequent spenders.  This game is realy just fun for the moment, not a long term game.
5850	0	a	Its just not fun for poor people. If you\'re rich af, try this, but people who dont want to spend much beware of this game. It will try to suck you dry of your money, because anything good in this game requires real money.
10643	1	a	Somehow having missed the previous games, the idea of what is essentially an arena shooter in much larger maps than usual and travelling much faster than usual, left me in awe.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the older Quake and Unreal engine games. Best of all - it's free; You lose no money in trying it out.
1285	1	a	i have been playing this with my friend and its actually not bad its basically a free version of GTA online or saints row with more customisation although this game relies on in game purchases you can still have fun i rate 8/10
6002	0	a	stay away from apb, unless you're a masochistic.
3053	1	a	If you like an open based world, customizable characters and vehicles, and plenty a guns to choose from. this is youre game. you can pick to be a good cop, bad cop, or just a criminal. the choice is yours.
8696	0	a	It was a great game until they change the game. The server so laggy when they put the server together {west and east}. Building load slow, bad community and banned for no reason even if its 'skills'. I believe the banning is causing the game to be low population 'silver is now gold' from what i heard. I hope they fix the game ASAP or its gonna go POOF.
1230	1	a	10/10 from me just wish the licence plate was a bit more readable :) All in all great game you should get.
2086	1	a	its a relly good game download it  
2351	1	a	wow much shooter
8423	0	a	this game made my brain wrecked
7959	0	a	First time funny, second and third time funny, too. But then u see more and more hacker &amp; glitcher.  NO FUN. Don't waste your time with that game!
10483	0	a	This game involves alot of boaring walking and seems like a bad fallout 3/NV multiplayer
7914	0	a	I am sick i this shity game because ost of the robbers are hackers useing thier aim bot and it so easy for them to get money and who idea was it to have a rocket launcher thats thing is too over powered  Fix this game  JarJarGamer
9697	0	a	This game is terrible. That's all you need to know about it.
10027	1	a	good and free many crafting items
6068	0	a	Its an awful awful game. Imagine World of Warcraft meets GTA. Except they added a bunch of WoW grinding and removed the fun from GTA.
3303	1	a	I liked APB.. but didn't continue after a couple of plays.. simply becuase it lacked controller support. There were a few features I would have liked to have seen also.. radio stations, more solid single quest modes and not just MP, because if your just starting, single quests is where you learn your tools to play the mp. a more detailed customisation of char. but I havent played in around 2 years so maybe they have these features now.. if your Kb&amp;M and stuck for cash, it's F2P.. worth a tryout, if you don't like then no harm done.
8296	0	a	  P2W simple as that. Wouldn't recommend it, the game it self is good visually looking but the only fun you'll get out of this is the customization, unless you're going to pay. If not then don't bother, you'll get easily outmatched by the op paid for weapons and super cars the enemies have compared to your very limited options (you don't wanna know how much more access p2p players have compared to you as a f2p). Also the community and car handeling in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing aweful, just trash.
2956	1	a	I've been playing APB for serval years, and i've seen that GamersFirst are updateing the game every week/month with cool stuff, i've wasted 15$+ And it was worth it. I recommend you to Play this game and have fun with others, like your friends, or create new Friends. There are 2 sides who are fighting upon: San Paro, Criminals and Enforcers. I'm an criminal, criminal can ram raid and get money faster Enforcers can witness you and Deliver the money if they Can.  You'll learn fast how to play. The map: Fight club, is used to Comaplte challenges and get JT (Joker Tickets) The others maps like: Finanical And Waterfront are used to do Missions and Rank up, and unlock cool stuff, The max rank is R235 I think.  SO I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES ACTION!
3908	0	a	Been playing since Real Time Worlds. Very customized, upgraded, armed characters. Migrated account when G1 took over. Had a lot of fun. Bought lots of G1 items. Premium too. In one of the first ban sweeps I was banned. Apparently they erroneously banned over 2000 people when this happened. I got unbanned. Then got banned again the next day. Contacted G1; my support ticket was locked, I was banned from G1 forums after posting what happened, and all my accounts were locked. Over $100 down the drain, and my RTW character. Avoid this game. It had a time when it was good; that time is not now. Maybe when they upgrade to the next Unreal engine but besides that, avoid. Bad customer service, money hungry devs, rage-filled community, very PTW items and fair matchmaking does not exist. The Bronze Gold Silver tier matchmaking just doesn't work. Avoid.  Pros: good customization Cons: Angry player base, PTW weapons, bad customer service, money hungry devs, unbalanced matchmaking   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   they banned my original RTW account, unbanned it, then rebanned it again for no reason. My account name was Flonga, and was completely clean. i was banned in a erroneous ban along with 3,000 other players. I paid lots of dosh and played many hours. I hate this game. But I'm redownloading it because I love it so much. But my RTW account is forever gone and for no reason at that. My thread that I created on the forums got many hits and replies and was brought to the attention of the staff. They unbanned me along with many others. In a short amount of time I was banned again for no reason, just like the first time. I posted in the forums again and was BLOCKED FROM ALL FORUM COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE MY THREAD THAT EMBARASSED THEM. I made another account to post on the forums and that was blocked as well. I love RTW, I really hate Reloaded studios. And still I'm redownloading it. I hope one day they will unban me (because I did literally nothing wrong like wtf). Until then, this game is terrible. But I love it. But it's terrible. I had so many weapons cars and mods and weapon mods and apparel and symbols and everything is gone. For what? Give me my account back that was TAKEN away from me
9562	0	a	Pat to win, graphics are terrible, damage output is terrible, doesnt explain how to do anything in the quests just plops them on you, takes an hour to download on steam and then two more hours to download the game in the launcher, wouldnt recomend it to anyone unless you like all these things in you game
8565	0	a	I don't get what this game is about
6439	0	a	I have no idea what I am doing
3946	0	a	Dying game, small community left of pay to win kids, unless you plan on getting hooked into spending close to 100$ (as everyone who is 'successful') I suggest not even downloading this game  even IGN wouldn't give this â¥â¥â¥â¥ a 5
1960	1	a	Worth a download.  aka AMAZING!!!
4690	0	a	This game only accomplishes one thing, customization. Everything else this game attempts to do is utter failure. Missions/Matches are greatly one sided, the gun play (The MAIN Point of a PVP Shooter) is copy and pace, repetitive, buggy, just flat out boring, driving is exactly what you would expect out of a F2P, âPoint A to point Bâ¦ Yayâ¦â and the game has a community worse than Halo and CoD!  All the time I spent in this game equaled to this.  70% Raging at a bad match because of how bad of a game this is. 25% Sitting in the social area AFK. 1% Having fun in a match. 3% Fun goofing around in the bland, small open areas (Its not even worth calling a sand box). 1% Enjoying the limited customization options for a non-monthly payment account.  This game is a perfect example of a horrible Pay2Win game being considered good by morons. Even being a Pay2Win, youâll still have to level up so slowly to the point where it makes Bad Company 2 level grinding look quick.  This game is even a better example than Call of Duty in showing how humans enjoy repetitive, copy and past, garbage.  The rating I give this game is a 2/10, not even worth looking at on the Steam Store. Its definitely not worth Recommending to anyone, unless you want them to check if Steamâs Uninstall button is still working.
10477	1	a	I &lt;3 you G1. And this game is rather monotonous. Still nice though. Instead of sleeping pills or such. Works.
10343	1	a	i absoulutly love this game. First time i have ever found a game with great deatail and lil to no lag .
4399	0	a	great potential horrible execution bad company -2/10 
4498	0	a	Can't even verify my email from my mail account to log into my gamersfirst account which i need to connect to my steam account for some reason.   Too many accounts - 0,0/10 IGN
8067	0	a	This game is a peice of sh*t! Do not install this game UNLESS you want to fork over a good $1000 to the companies whop made this game. This is just amazing how I thought it was a good game, then all of the sudden I start playing it. For the first 10 minutes, it's OK. But then high ranking players sniper me from a lightyear away. It's redicious. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!
10729	1	a	With the Public Test Server and the update that is coming in September the 28th, HiRez has certainly recaptured their players into the game again.  Their flagship game is secure!
1264	1	a	A new gen GTA....well guys give it a shot!
1084	1	a	could not make an accout 11/12
1728	1	a	If you can't afford GTA then you should really try APB Reloaded, an open world full of Criminals and Enforcers, steal cars or drive your own, go on missions and gain some money. It takes a little getting used to but it's fun once you get the hang of it. The customization is great, probably the best out of F2P games except, the hair styles. The graphics are good but you will need good specs to run it smoothly.
5126	0	a	When updating this game my disk usage is at 100%.   this program is 7GB of adds and background progams running at all times.    10/10 background apps
2682	1	a	Good free game, but lacking something......
1417	1	a	Oh my god, please. Just get the game. 11/10 'Let's Be Bad Guys' Simulator 2014   No but really tho, get it. Sure, weapons can be bought for money, and other people have money and blah blah blibbity blah, but you can get them for free... It's like planetside, but it's cops and robbers. Who the hell doesn't like cops and robbers?!
1780	1	a	Great game if your a fan of GTA series.
3925	0	a	If you're going to play this, you're going to have a baaad time.  If you do pay with real money though you can go really well! If you go Enforcer you're going to win 90% of the time :D  And hey, maybe you won't rage at how unfair and unbalanced the whole damn game is you MAY get a little kick out of it.
462	1	a	It's free
6242	0	a	â¥â¥â¥
3576	1	a	It's an ok game I guess.
1517	1	a	My neighbours complain when i die.
1647	1	a	Not the most riveting game of all time. It's VERY much a grind, the community is HORRIBLE, mostly just trolls and not only do the mods and GMs not care about trolling, they take an active part in it. They SAY cashshoping is 'balanced' and doesn't give cashshoppers an unfair advantage, but that SO isn't true.  The good, though? Pretty much unparalleled customization. Customizable clothes. Customizable cars. Even customizable MIDI-ish themes you opponent hears when you kill them.  This game seems to love to tap into that primal part of your brain that makes you want to show off your decaled-up car to the masses.    It's a time-killer, but definitely not something I'd pay money into. But that's just me. Paying into it apparantly DOES help the game progress faster... no joke, it gives you extra 'standing' and money.
3165	1	a	This Game would be more fun , if it have boat or motorcycle
8821	0	a	Guys, im sorry to give this a bad review. But there are alot of bugs and things that i just hate in this game.     Ok so first off, i have played this since i was 6 and i loved it. That was when i was 6. i got back into it at 11. (my age right now). Im going to list alot of topics in this.     Aiming  So i have alot to say about aiming. I think its unique but stupid too. When i am aiming at a person i have to press v to switch sides. and this is my personal recomendation but i prefer when its in the middle of the screen.I cant hit them with anything because of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t aiming even at point blank because any mouse sensitivity doesnt work, even with a damn shotgun. Also i cant even see my shoes when looking at my character, except when im looking down. Next topic.      Radar  Ok this is not as important but you should still read it. When i am trying to kill someone, it doesnt show them on my radar, unless they are in plain sight, also it mostly all of the time, shows people below you. Which i think is â¥â¥â¥â¥in stupid. Also it doesnt show them when they are 'hiding'. i put that in quotes because that mechanic is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Next topic.      Grenades and Splash Damage  Ok when a vehicle is near me and explodes it should kill me. Even with perks. Also grenades, without perks.      Loading  Ok the loading is way to long, if they could fix that it would be nice.      G1C  You get a ripoff of G1C when you pay. if they could increase the amount of G1C that you get it would also be nice.
5801	0	a	Don't recommend this game. Leave your account alone for a few years, and they'll ban you and delete support requests. Real 'gamers first' :) Good luck all.
620	1	a	Love this game very much! No words can explain &lt;3
7672	0	a	i cant play it
459	1	a	GTA but free
9670	1	a	I need help..I made two accounts for this but do not know my username. Never was provided..I wasted 5 hours of sleep waiting for this to download because I was excited to play it but nooooooooo my username or password is not correct. HELPPPP PLS
4562	0	a	i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)
9246	0	a	another waste of time game
10731	1	a	best F2P shooter on steam. makes a classic cool again. period
2945	1	a	Not the best shooter around, mostly pay to win because of the wepons ect. But still has an amazing customization option and gives you the chance to create your own thug/hero.  6/10.
4427	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME
7758	0	a	there's to much lag. It sucks.
691	1	a	I really, really want to love APB (All Points Bulletin): Reloaded more than I do. Yes, the original APB was riddled with enough cracks and flaws to take it from diamond-in-the-rough to half-eaten-Ring-Pop-that's-shaped-like-a-diamond, but some of its more ambitious ideas were very nearly brilliant. And hey, Reloaded â for the most part â smartly tweaks APB's little problems while leaving its cops-and-robbers core undisturbed. On paper, it sounds like every wannabe grand automobile thief's dream come true. So then, what exactly went wrong?   Above: If only he'd just worn his safety belt  The short answer: A lot of things. First, though, it's essential to point out what went right, because â without a doubt â APB: Reloaded is a more enjoyable experience than its short-lived predecessor. APB's DNA â once a criss-crossing-crashing amalgam of MMO persistence and barely functional riffs on GTA's best ideas â has been straightened into a much finer point. Weapons now do more damage, resulting in faster, more satisfying firefights. Cars, meanwhile, actually possess unique driving models. In other words, no more sports cars that drive like minivans. There's also a teensy bit of weapon-usage-based stat progression to give you something to do beyond amassing a gun collection that'd make even John Woo's bullet-loving doves flee in terror. And then there's a real-money-based in-game store that... well, more on that in a bit.  In a lot of ways, APB fights desperately to be the antidote to modern MMO drudgery â sometimes to a fault. Beyond rudimentary side objectives (things like raiding stores if you're a criminal or returning stolen cars for enforcers), the game is essentially PVE-free. Missions auto-plop you into a group of fellow ne'er-do-wells (or loose cannon cops who don't play by the rules) and assign you objectives â for instance, investigate a vehicle or commit some nice, wholesome arson. The twist, however, is that your enemies aren't trash mob NPCs - they're flesh-and-blood members of the opposing faction. So missions unfold more like objective-based shooter matches, but in a completely open, vehicle-packed urban playground. When APBR works, it really, really works. There's nothing quite like racing neck-and-neck against a sports car full of gangbangers â guns-a-blazing the whole time â toward an objective, crashing and twisting through the air like you've been punted by Godzilla, and then emerging from the wreckage into a hail of gunfire and, er, regular fire. Other MMOs, meanwhile, ask you to collect 20 boar gizzards because, f*** you, don't question it, chore peasant. Better still, similar chaos unfolds all around you, thanks to other groups on similar â though separate â missions. Bullets fly. Cars careen through the streets. Magic happens.   Before long, though, you can't help but see behind the curtain of explosions and car shrapnel, because that's pretty much all there is to it. Mission types are incredibly limited, generally breaking down into âfind and deliver a thing,â âstop the other team from finding and delivering a thing,â and âhold a point for a really long time.â New self-contained âFight Clubâ districts attempt to spice up the rather vanilla proceedings with large-scale team deathmatch and king of the hill battles, but the two currently available maps lend themselves more to haphazard lone wolfery and camping than interesting team tactics.   APBR's city, meanwhile, is utterly lacking in the loving attention to detail of, say, a GTA or the zany outlandishness of a Saints Row. It's just a sprawling sea of gray spotted with shamefully tiny islands of intrigue. So, by and large, APBR devolves into a very simple shooter with very simple modes in a very simple environment. On top of that, the story's basically non-existent. Occasionally, your contracted mission-givers will send you emails, but there's no sense of escalation or progression. It's just an unending tug-of-war between cops and robbers that never actually goes anywhere â a dynamic justifiable only if APBR is secretly set in Purgatory. That general lack of personality becomes all the more disappointing when you start really digging into APBR's absurdly robust character customization suite. Once you've filled out your wardrobe and unlocked a few decal templates, anything's possible. So, of course, we created something that could best be described as the unholy offspring of Batman Beyond and the mopiest, most blue-haired JRPG character you can imagine. At one point, we actually encountered an incredibly authentic Harley Quinn â jester cap and all â and it was love at first sight. Then she shot us in the face. Long story short, APBR's players supply nearly all of its personality. And while that's an interesting idea on paper, it fails to thaw a frozen, unchanging world whose bag of tricks is about as deep as a drought-devoured puddle.   But what about all that free-to-play razzle-dazzle that APB savior GamersFirst can't stop clamoring about? Business models, after all, can make or break MMOs. And while APBR's âArmas Marketplaceâ certainly isn't broken, there are some very worrisome cracks in its armor. For one, the game constantly pestered us about biting a $10 bullet and signing up for a month of Premium access, and it's not hard to see why. Among other things, our piggy bank's valiant sacrifice more than doubled our end-of-mission cash rewards, hugely boosted our faction gains with mission givers, reduced cooldowns, and gave us a 20% discount on all marketplace items. Basically, Premium's the way APBR was meant to be played. Free, by comparison, feels downright sluggish. Then there's the extremely sticky issue of buyable weaponry. Armaments that cost you an arm and a leg aren't necessarily better or worse than those earned by the sweat of your tattooed brow; they're merely different variations on similar ideas. So, ultimately, a kitted out character and someone who upped their arsenal the old fashioned way will be on a roughly even playing field after many hours of play. However, we were able to roll a completely fresh character and immediately buy a fully modded gun that many experienced players swore by. Suddenly, getting matched against fellow low rank players didn't seem so fair. APBR's early goings, then, can be a figurative trial by fire and bees. Because the fire wasn't bad enough.   APBR is a game that suffers from a serious identity crisis. It tries to be both an emergent, skill-based shooter and a full-blown free-to-play MMO, but only succeeds at falling into the abyssal middle ground between the two. Thanks to a number of tiny tweaks and larger additions, Reloaded is definitely a step up from the practically DOA APB that crashed and burned a couple years ago, but the two are still incredibly similar. Fundamental mission structure and variety flaws, unfortunately, stuck around for the ride, and its (improved) simplistic shooting and driving aren't enough to right those wrongs.   It's honestly heartbreaking, because many of the game's ideas teeter on the cusp of being revolutionary. As is, however, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded fires far too many blanks. Free is a tough price to turn down, but the city of San Paro is â at best â a vacation spot. We simply can't recommend an extended stay.
3600	1	a	I love this game, it is a very good game, and you don't have to pay real money to get anything if you're willing to just play the game. All of these people say it feels like a GTA clone, because it almost it! That's the point of it, the game is amazing, but expect it to take up a lot of your time, and be frustrating when somebody has a free trial gun.
6822	0	a	Really boring and generic
8500	0	a	DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!
8466	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game...they say : ' Apb Reloaded need at least 2gb of ram and 4 gb recomanded ' i gave 2 gb ram..and i can run it ... ok ... :/
3064	1	a	I like it...its fun...play it....yep
950	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
1039	1	a	The lag on this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke, it actually just makes you angry when you play because the server is so crap it can't handle the game itself. you get good days and bad but really, Don't drop a single cent into this game as I made the mistake of doing, you'll get owned by aimbotters who don't care if they get banned because they just create new free accounts and start all over again. I just played a game now after some time and wow, the lag made me want to throw my laptop into a wall.
6012	0	a	ILL WAIT MORE ON LOADING SCREEN THAT I WILL LAST PLAYING THIS GAME
10709	1	a	Awesome F2P FPS.
9810	0	a	this game is like if you date a drunk girl she gets drunk lett you go all the way but you still go out dry  (its fun in the start but sucks when the actual online starts)
1586	1	a	A lot of cons in this game, A LOT. i hate it, but i still want to play it   9/10
10728	1	a	This is my second favorite shooter of all time. The high speed of the players, combined with all the weapons having travel time, makes for some very difficult shots. The adrenaline rush of this game is very exciting, and the satisfaction of pulling off that impossible shot is rewarding. The graphics are beautiful, with Ultra settings rivaling top names graphics. On lowest settings, an AMD A8 mobile APU can run it with ease. The gamplay is very good, as i mentioned before. There are several classes, including assault rifle, sniper, and several other classics, along with unique classes. The classes are customizable to a certain degree. This multiplayer in this game is great, and I'm not experiencing any lag at all.  A lot of people are saying this game is dead, but that's the farthest thing from the truth. There's still a small community of us who still play and enjoy this game. Yes if it were opened up by the developers or the P2W features were removed it would be way better but this game is still incredibly enjoyable as-is. Definitely recommend this title.
7260	0	a	The game summary: The User that has the best hacks wins.
7988	0	a	i meet minimum requirements and my graphic card isnt good enough   -11/10
6621	0	a	this game is not working for me at all
9495	1	a	i think its perety col its awsome some peps should come try it out 
6099	0	a	Just. Ugh.
4202	0	a	All the gameplay is just you being killed by people who have been playing longer
7663	0	a	This game is simply terrible. The matchmaking sucks (newbies always get paired against veterans), the gear is temporary unless you shell out real money for it, the game won't leave you alone about upgrading to a premium account, and the hit locations are meaningless (you can snipe someone in the foot and it'll technically count as a headshot if they don't have armor). On top of that, botters are rampant throughout the entire game. Most everyone I've played against has at least an aim-bot and/or trigger-bot because they aren't good enough to actually play the game without hacks. The missions are totally bland, too. Every single one basically boils down to whoever can get to the objective location first, and then it's a camp-fest while waiting to murder the entire team challenging the same location.  The bottom line is that APB: Reloaded looked like a good idea on paper, but the execution is horrendous. The anti-cheat system is basically non-existent, as the engine believes botters to be players with pin-point precision (which, in reality, is virtually impossible). With no reliable way to control the cheaters in the community, there's really no point in playing the game at all unless you're with friends. Then you all can have a good laugh at how bad the game is. Skip it.
3215	1	a	suck my healthy nuts
10438	1	a	I just started this game today.I'm not going to lie game took forever to download:(, but after it was done I opened it and it crashed.I didnt really mind because I have a poor quality laptop, then I played it and enjoyed it and i'm still only doing missions for one person with 2 hours.Yea I said 2 HOURS so that proves how much enjoyment this game gives.
9503	1	a	great survival game good crafting recipes this has a good storyline to it its awesome
3616	1	a	the game is okay i wish there was no hackers p2w players are not the problem now its hackers i still play it. fun with friends, nice cars, cool events, hackers thumbs down, if you can handle hackers i recommend.
752	1	a	Fun game once you understand how the high ranks play, although you might bump into one or two hackers.
8519	0	a	This game is full of cheaters. RIP Do not waste 5 gig on this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10282	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
6514	0	a	Pay2Win always throws away any value or fun, don't get this game unless you can bother to spend lots of cash.
9922	1	a	there are few open world games which cost ($) but this one is free with third-person view as well as first-person view with nice weapons but the annoying creatures that want to kill you run the same pace so its had to esccape and when I ran I died at least 4 times in a row!
2414	1	a	Sometimes you just want to drive around with sirens on and thats pretty much why I keep playing lol. Besides that though its just fun to run around do missions with friends and taunting other players over the mic. Sometimes you even make friends with the competition! Also the customization options are amazing and why I fell in love with this game in the first place back since the Realtime World days. The possibilities are endless as long as you have the imagination for it.
192	1	a	PROS: Cops vs Robbers Extreme Customization for Character Extreme Customization for Cars Lots of Guns Two Open World Maps Modifications that affect the player, cars and guns  CONS: New players at a disadvantage (need to unlock everything) Hitreg can sometimes be a problem Not enough players for fair balanced matches most of the time
8559	0	a	I can't tell if I like this game or not because I seriously can't tell if I'm playing the game right or not. I've never played something that's kept me utterly confused six months after playing it.
2326	1	a	Awesome game, funny to play, good staff , mixed things to do 10/10 ;)
10062	0	a	The game's â¥â¥â¥â¥
1044	1	a	geat game almost flawless reminds me of grand theft auto
1520	1	a	the second gta v online very nice game i recommend:)
10003	0	a	its so bad dont download 
4388	0	a	I could not register an account because there was a add covering the create account button that i could not exit out of.
10662	1	a	It is free to play, and its just like old Tribes. It is awesome. Worth the time.
7971	0	a	This game is so confusing and never got to kill any crooks or cops because of some reason and all of the stuff is pay to get
9573	0	a	I used to view this game positive since it reminds me of my childhood but after playing recently I realised how much this game sucks its like a degraded boring version of Fallout... If you are still playing this then go try fallout already
8907	1	a	Fallen earth really was a surprise for me. Ive been playing for around a year now on the standard client and I can't say enough about this game. Switching over to steam client version was perfect for sharing moments with friends. I am really having a blast playing it right now. Steep learning curve keeps a lot of the 'usual' mmo crowd out. This I like! Huge open sandbox world. Think I read over 5,500 quests and 11,000 square miles of area? MASSIVE!  The game has some amazing developers under its wing too. They are trying to improve the game daily with small updates, bug fixes and is one of the minor few games which takes community thoughts and feelings into persepctive.  Great community and if you get stuck or need a friend to help there are help chats, auctions, private chats &amp; town chats (In-game!)  Class-less characters to play as you wish and 6 factions and the factions are not all against each other but have their enemies, arch enemy, and allies among those 6. The character design feature is superb also! Very open and user friendly.  The graphics and model designs are not the best in quality terms but its not about the graphics on Fallen earth. The quests and community is the main focus in my opnion; which is great! Got a nice mix of PvE and PvP. PvP in certain areas as well as conflict towns in the higher zones.  Concluding, Fallen Earth is a great game if you have a varied lifestyle with a couple of hours every week to login and play. System specs are a little high but this keeps the younger generations away, A more adult style game.   Worth a try! (4 Stars)
5687	0	a	One of the worst MMO's I have ever played!! Choppy servers, co-op is bad also. Alot of the Geeks that play will join your group only to shoot you in the back. Just bad with no sense of community .
1454	1	a	You know, I enjoyed this game......then well â¥â¥â¥â¥ happened  never left beta to many hackers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mactch making system  so over all one of the best games ive ever played!
926	1	a	I've never played this game
580	1	a	love the customization in this game, its great
8076	0	a	The one thing I can say about this game, is that if youve played GTA at all online, you wont want to play this game. there are way too many fetures in this game that just do not work at all. That being said, even as a stand alone with no history of ever playing GTA this game sucks.
8335	0	a	This game has one of the best player and outfit creating tools in any game. And its a shame really because thats the only good thing about this game. First of all and biggest complaints is people using hacks. I would say about 35% of players are actively using hacks such as aimbots. Sure some get banned but in a free to play game were a cheater simply has to make a new account and is back into the game aimboting away. I have spent many hours in this game and I can say the only enjoyment i get is making cool designs and hanging out in the social district. Actually playing this game is a big no no with all the aimbots. Stack all that with the most wallet gougeing pay to win model you can think of and you have APB  1/10 and it would be a zero if not for the amazing ability to customize characters. but they found a way to make you have to pay for that as well
10234	1	a	looks like a promising game ill have to look at it after i start playing it tho
5103	0	a	game dosen't even launch, had brief moment where it did work and it was ok but then stoped working again. can not recommend
9247	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
4837	0	a	The Game where every second player are cheating...aimbot,wh.Play if you can...or can...
10412	1	a	i like it.theres crafting looting and alot of other kool mechanics
10485	1	a	This is a sandbox game of sorts with the elements of games such as DayZ,Fallout and Rust.However,since it lacks the visual beauty of DayZ and the back story of games such as Nether and Fallout,it is not quite as popular as one might hope. The game still requires some tweeks here and there but with patience and some tlc,this game has extreme potential. The depth of crafting and exploring is truly unique along with the optional co-operation of other players. It's been quite awhile since I last played this game but I believe it deserves a second chance from those who shun it due to graphics and any slight game play bugs. All in all?Give it a chance.
1304	1	a	its aight
3446	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10
1132	1	a	10/10 would burn wallet again.
2255	1	a	Most addicting game ever!
9408	0	a	JUST BUY FALLOUT 4 OR 3 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS 11/10
5186	0	a	Why not to play this game ~ - Pay to win game  - Start versing High ranks and Golds - Scammers  - Getting banned for no reason  - Can get robbed by the game (G1C) - Waste of Time
598	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
429	1	a	Ruined my life. 11/10 Would play again.
2085	1	a	Very Nice Game,Fast And Full Of Action,Really Cool ;)
5775	0	a	the game tend to go repetitive after a while, there pay 2 win guns that can easily overpower normal ones even tho u can get them in game playing which it will take ages literally. there performance issue with some pc mostly Fps laggs. Uninstalled due to poor matchmaking in game.
2647	1	a	It's from one of the designers of Grand Theft Auto. So think of it like that. But better, because this is not a serious game in any way. It's all about fun, and it is. I love the customization-- crazy stuff!
10533	1	a	It's like a mix between Unreal Tournament, Team Fortress 2, and Tiny Wings  - Unreal Tournament for the style and variety of weapons and vehicles - Team Fortress 2 for the 9-class system - Tiny Wings for the hill flying system  Pros: - Graphics and stylization - Music and sound - Unique hill-flying mechanic - Extremely fast pace - Feeling of heart-pounding awesomeness (that x-factor)  Cons: - Pay-to-win; unlocking things through gameplay takes FOREVER - Steep skill curve (aiming is hard at 150+ kph)  Overall, 7.8/10
7354	0	a	I try and play it and my computer says that it's already running when it's not
2461	1	a	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice game! xD
1702	1	a	dude this game is a o mazing 
9417	1	a	I see this time and time again. A new player joins and quits after about a few hours, not giving the game enough time to fully understand it. This game is very good what i like the most about it is the ability to build your character's stats almost any waay u want to. also the crafting is very in depth and almost like no other mmo. i recommend giving this game a try.
2188	1	a	Amazing game when playing with friends!
2412	1	a	Alright, this is definitely going to be one of the more...odd reviews I'll have written, but APB is an odd game in the end. Here's how it goes: in the beginning, right when you start out, you'll be a trainee who knows nothing about the game except for what the tutorials show you how to do. And, more than likely, on your first mission, you'll be run over (both figuratively and probably literally) quite heavily. And, if you only get to play this game a little, with no connection to the forums or people to show you the ropes, you'll have a hard time actually getting good at the game.   The skill gradient in this game is intense and impossibly cruel, as you'll have to figure out things on your own all the while being trashed by your enemies, not to mention the learning curve. As with any game, there are some mechanics that you have to learn by doing, but in a game so diverse and deep as this (yes, it does have a definite deepness to it), there will be some mechanics that aren't overtly intuited by your gameplay, which makes the gameplay even more frustrating.   And, to speak of frustration, there will definitely be a lot of it. From the people using better guns, better strategies, better teamwork, and all around better gameplay, to your lack of knowledge of the game, there will be an intense amount of frustration on your end, mostly due to how -unfair- it all seems. Indeed, I know how it is. It took me up to rank 200 (out of a possible 255 ranks currently) to generally get good with about 75% of the game in total. And, on top of all that, you'll get the odd hacker here and there which will be upsetting for the people who're trying to play fairly, if only to add to the mess.  And yet, do I reccommend this game? I'm certainly wavering hesitantly over those two buttons down there, trying to decide if I -do- want more people to experience the game or if they should simply stay the hell away. It's really a tough choice, let me tell you.  After all, there are some redeeming parts to this game. The social aspect, if you get into it, can be enjoyable. The idiots in district chat are always there to be taunted if they get pissy about a game they lost, or if they're generally being stupid, and there are the charismatic teammates in the game that really make you enjoy a particular mission you're on. You could end up in a large clan where you get to play with a great amount of people with varied playstyles, or even make some good friends in the game and join their clan of a small, yet tightly knit, group.  To add to that, there's a large amount of variance in this game, meaning there's a huge number of guns and subsequent variations of from which to choose, along with cars and clothing, all of which can be customised to some extent. And, if you add to that the possibility of Premium accounts, then you add more slots for customisation. On top of even all that is ARMAS, which houses a plethora of guns that can only be attained fully by purchasing them, along with custom parts for some cars, and purchase-only clothing parts and gear. (That's the Pay2Win part of the game.) In reality, most of the ARMAS guns are there for the people who don't want to wait to unlock weapons in the game, or people who don't want to shell out in-game money every ten days for the guns they regularly use. Almost every weapon in the game is good enough and viable to play, as long as you match the gun to the situation it's prime in. Protip: don't be good or favour any one gun; try and be skillful with all of them.  In the end...I think I would reccommend this game to you. Yes, it lags. Yes, there are some hackers. Yes, it's difficult, and yes, the client crashes 10 percent of the time, but...I think it's something I want you to experience. It's something you can get addicted to easily, whether or not you enjoy it. All in all, I think it's a decent enough game.   So, give it a try. Put in about 500 hours worth of time, and then see if you want to quit it.   ~Kuro  -------------------------------- Tips: -Learn to tap-fire. Most guns are useless if you spray full-auto. -Starting gun 'Star556' is strong already if you know how to tap-fire. NTEC is also beastly; It's not called 'wintec' for nothing. -Make a max-height character to see the whole hitbox. All characters share the same hitbox size, so even if your body is fully behind cover as a small person, your hitbox might not be. -Play on bronze servers; Silver is full of highly-skilled players and hackers. -If you want Premium from ARMAS, don't buy only premium. Get a Joker box bundle. Chances are you'll get some nifty guns as well as premium codes in there. -Look up weapon guides, car guides, and code lists in the Steam 'help guides' that are available. They'll help to show you what's decent for which situation. -Gold servers are empty. No one goes there. You won't get opposition. Don't waste your time entering them.
9394	1	a	what an awful game this was
4505	0	a	This game has it's fair share of issues... It's one of those 'Pay to Win' games with korean style web-browser RMT-shop. Hackers run rampant and even if you manage to play with legit players, you will be (Seriously, you WILL be. Matchmaking sucks due to low player population and crappy code) decimated by them because they are far more experienced and better geared than you. Also, you will get against clans a lot, so prepare for that if you are ever going to give this game a shot. It's buggy, it feels cheap, missions get repetitive after a while and everything sucks.  Well, not everything. I enjoyed thoroughly the many customization options APB has. Sticking decals to yourself and to your car is more fun than it seems at first. You also could do even your own songs and 'themes' using an ingame music studio. But don't get too excited, you are not going to be able to explore all of it - some extremely useful features are locked behind a paywall.  Bottom line: Unless you are ready to pay for 'premium' - membership (Yeah, this game has a 'subscription', by subscribing, you can get your hands on more content which you cannot access as a normal player) and for some OP-weapons (Which can cost as much as 40 - 60â¬ and more EACH) , don't buy this game. In my opinion, there are better things (GAMES) to spend your money on.
8314	0	a	It is a pretty good game, if you dont have any other free roam games like gta, sleeping dogs, etc. But if you have one of those games, this game is crap.
2670	1	a	It's like GTA Online, but free. Customization is unreal, so much you can do to make your character.
4846	0	a	Another P2W (Pay to win) game. Pointless.
10514	1	a	Tribes Finally got support from devolpers :) After 2 years abbadoned good game back to life :) 
2180	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played its fun to play i Recommend it to everyone
261	1	a	highly addictive and heaps of fun with friends i defs recommend it to ppl looking for laughs
9322	0	a	Terrible controls are clunkey and are some what delayed pros:  1. not hard to run 2.decent story  cons:  EVERYTHING ELSE  dont waste your time on this game
1089	1	a	This game can get you raged as all hell, and yet once your hooked you'll keep coming back..  If you find the good side of the community, make a few friends, and get built up a little bit you'll love it.
304	1	a	It's nice game!
6098	0	a	trash community full of wierdos, nameâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and weeaboos. pay 2 win system. trash game engine lagging and stuttering with minimal graphics on high-end pc. sessional match system. terrible matchmaking (enjoy your game with 25R bronzes in your team vs 255R golds with communication and p2w guns from clan). 3 separated maps (regions/districts) instead of big one with no borders. frustrating and boring gameplay. the game is no more in development phase means you will never see any new features and gameplay extensions, but only reskins for old weapons. 
5191	0	a	I think honestly they should have tried making changes way earlier when they were just starting out, rather than waiting 3 years to try and change anything. The lighting now sucks and the graphics are terribly all over the place. The weapons keep getting rebalanced even when they're in a perfect state, unecessary changes to a lot of things instead of where it actually counts.
4710	0	a	To be perfectly frank, I can't think of one fun aspect in this game. There's barely any content, almost noone is online in my timezone(most likely caters to another country), and I could almost imedietly tell this is a pay-to-win.
1619	1	a	Arrested someone for holding a TV. 10/10
8761	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, please dont, just dont.
2088	1	a	0/10 did not even download the game
5135	0	a	This game costs as much as it's budget.
7220	0	a	It's not really that great to me...but that might just be the lag I get...
10350	0	a	Well, the character creation was pretty neat. Sadly, that's the only part of this game I was able to experience -- as soon as I entered the game world, I was dumped into an angular white void and then crashed mere minutes later. Can't say I'm impressed.
3143	1	a	Best dress up game ever made. Also really fun to play with bros for a while.
7608	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks u cant download it it is a gllitch

3991	0	a	For the 1st and 2nd day this was a great game to play by myself and with friends. However over time this game started to slip away from the fun side. The game was full of tryhards, and I could see it was a pay to win because of this I started to feel less pumped about the game. I started to think 'Am I back in call of duty?'. However I continued playing the game as I liked large amounts of it and that I'm not one to just turn my back on a game due to some 'errors'. Then on the 3rd or 4th day (after being stressed out from everyday life) I logged in to have a whale of a time only to find a lovely message 'account blocked/ error 10008'. After looking online I found many people have got this due to so called 'cheating'. I have not cheated. So why am I blocked from this game! I'm not saying people don't cheat but People have been playing the game for thousands of hours and kicked due to just playing the damn game! Some people have just got the game and blocked before they had even started playing the game. Sounds fishy? I also have problems logging onto they're website and I feel like I have wasted 44 hours. 44 hours I'm not getting back! I feel sorry for the people who have spent hundreds of hours on this! So no, I don't recommend this game. Sorry APB Reloaded but never again will I play your games or recommend this game to anyone else. Thank you to anyone who spent there time to read this and thank you to the people who have made and helped keep this game running for the hours of fun I have had but I think I'm ganna stick to the games that care about they're players.

3642	1	a	Great game
6484	0	a	I thought this game would of been good untill i download and it dosent even open!!!! i would like it if this was not bugged
6873	0	a	wont let me play it because of an error
5050	0	a	This game, is BAD. Let's start of by saying you play with the best players at the beginning of the damn game, who have all the best gear, the best cars, and can easily tank all the noobies around. There are hackers everywhere, I was just driving along my merry way down the street, with no enemy in sight, when suddenly, I died. I have no clue how that happened, it could've been a bug, but I blame hackers, none of the games I've played have ever shot me in the face while I drive down in the street. Have fun trying to get any objectives done, if you're a noob with a team of pros, you're going to make them fail, and it will only be you, you want to know why? BECAUSE THIS GAME SUCKS â¥â¥â¥.
4351	0	a	this game susks â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game runs wores than a fat chick runing a 50mil long track
5009	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
9290	1	a	Good game, definetly worth the price of nothing.
4471	0	a	Deleted. I've tried to enjoy this so many times. But every time I play it just tends to make me really angry. The matchmaking, hacking, and the fact you cant leave a mission when your team mates aren't even playing was enough to finish it for me.   If they fix that stuff, I'd be interested in looking at it. Until they do, game over APB.
9553	0	a	If you like to RP then this game is for your for everything else go find a different game. The Devs have no idea how to develop a video game and most of them ended up quiting anyways there is like 3 developers left.
4816	0	a	LOL, how does this game still have people trying so hard in it
3844	0	a	I've played this game over 8000 hours( mostly non steam as you can see ). I've wasted 1000 of euros of ingame transactions..  Alot of hackers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Engine â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GM's  I do not recommend this game,  Pros:  U can pretty much customize everything.
6151	0	a	VERRY BORRING AND shity grafix....
6456	0	a	Other than the really good customization features. You are up for a sketchy game. By sketchy I mean, there is no anti-cheat system, nor is there a proper 'Report abuse' feature. They don't care who or what you think is hacking. They just do whatever to buff or debuff weapons and more. The guns and most of the other features are locked unless you have premium. It's one those F2P games where you have to buy Premium in order to get the most out of a game. Of course, most games do the same, but for this game, Premium statuses make the game unbalanced. (This is my opinion and expressing why I wouldn't recommened the game).
4907	0	a	game dosen't even launch, had brief moment where it did work and it was ok but then stoped working again. can not recommend

5225	0	a	11/10 after 900 Hours punkbuster decides to kick me out everytime when i try to login.  but seriously, they updated their punkbuster so less hackers, P2W ofc. and the game needs to be fixed, if you have 4Gb RAM you cannot play this game it will be laggy. no more F2P items coming, only P2W items example pants what costs 20â¬ irl money. cannot recommend.
6502	0	a	f@@K this matchmaking... Golds playing in bronze and silver districts but not in gold... Gj , well played useless â¥â¥â¥â¥ks...
1724	1	a	An excellent third person shooter with tons of ability to customize your look and your vehicle. The game consists of two very large (1000+ meters) city maps where many teams of either faction are engaged in missions simultaneously. All in all a fantastic third person shooter that I spent hundreds of hours playing!  Pros - Full customization of vehicle and character with large multitudes of clothing and the ability to make completely custom designs. Every character and vehicle looks completely unique. - Large array of guns with custom skins, though most of the skins have to be bought through the in game store. - Progression system. If you like these, it's there. You get quick access to the base versions of guns, so it's not too bad. Though, things such as the OPGL and OSMAW come much later, as well as a couple of the cars. - Frequently matched against new people, so you're not playing against the same team over and over again like in other multiplayer shooters.  Cons - The open world can lead to griefing and 'ghosting' on occasion, or just some frustration as you're trying to drive to the next objective as quickly as you can while getting rammed by cars driven by other players. - Some of the guns in the in game store which cost real money to buy can be considered across the board better than some of the guns available as free to play.
9648	0	a	I STRONGLY suggest that anyone who is considering getting this game should reconsider- oh it's free you say? its not worth the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. let alone your money- this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing badly made that i swear to god it puts the developers to shame. infact shout out to the developers, dont make awkward controls, boring maps, and ridiculously patronizing intros, unless you are expecting money to grow on trees. played not even two hours of this game 10/10 would uninstall again.
3750	0	a	  After two years of playing this game, I have finally come to a point in which I can review it in full for what it is. And to be truthful, the positives are beginning to fade leaving merely negatives.     APB: Reloaded is a shadow of its former self in many regards, and these days is a shambling mess that won't warrant attention for much longer. With a dwindling playerbase and a greedy publisher, things have been turning sour as of late. Years ago during the original APB, the game looked and performed better for what it provided. Sure, it was a mess back then and it still is now. But some aspects were better back then, from what I've heard.  As a player who had played the game for well over 2,900 hours, I have experienced just about all there is to be offered by the game. And maintaining my honesty, there's some great potential locked away in this game. The potential for player designed content is stunning, and no other game provides such depth for customization on such a broad scale. Other games like EvE Online might provide an excellent character creation suite, and racing games like Forza (can't recall which one specifically) that have in depth car customization exist... But no other game brings systems akin to those present in other titles all into one MMO. Sounds great, doesn't it? If only it wasn't nearly impossible to get into the game.  Back a couple of years ago when I started playing APB:R, there were times I had to force myself to play to get accustomed to the game. I loved it too much to let it go, but it wasn't doing me any favours because it was (and still is) very harsh on new players. All the new free content is almost exclusively available to high ranking players with lots of experience, or to those who wish to become a wallet warrior using the in game cash shop. Now, to put it bluntly... No, I do not think APB is very Pay2Win. Are there some P2W aspects present in the game? Yeah, there is. But almost all of the things that will affect you in an actual match, things that dictate your performance against other players, can be achieved without dropping a dollar on the game. Most paid items merely exist as a shortcut to something that you can still earn on your own, but it'll take a lot of work to get those items.   But, more on the subject of the game rather than the playerbase; how is it really? Well, it's a glorified version of Cops vs Robbers you used to play as a kid in your back yard when you were a kid. That, and then an insane amount of customization potential. The customization elements are rock solid and very enjoyable to use, and you'd be very surprised with the things that some people are capable of creating in game. But the game... How does it run? Well, poorly. The thing about a lot of people who play Free2Play games is that they aren't usually very wealthy and can't afford much in terms of paid games or a strong computer to play them on. APB tends to perform rather badly for some lower end hardware configurations which frankly kills that part of the market. Unless you have a very high end computer, you best be ready for feeling serious stuttering in game. However the dedicated servers that the game is hosted on are also rather bad. The server hardware is slowly being worked on to be upgraded, but it will take a long time for full deployment of the new hardware. Unfortunately, the new hardware that provides better server quality (not by much) is only high end consumer grade desktop hardware. Not server grade stuff... But consumer grade stuff. Disappointing, really.  The combat in game is somewhat hampered at times due to the condition of the servers, which results in poor hit detection for some people and frequent lag spikes on certain servers with the older server hardware. Driving can also be awkward, as driving in APB isn't like in other games. According to the developers, certain things are bound to the server and you have to interact with the server in order to interact with certain items... Like vehicles. There's an easily noticeable delay in steering and throttle for vehicles as you are technically sending commands to the server to move your vehicle, then waiting for it to confirm those actions and send information back to you for your game to display on your monitor. So to put it briefly, the combat and driving can be rather clunky at times.  All in all though, is the game worth it to try and get into? Currently, it's not quite there. Unless you absolutely adore the customization options available, then it isn't really worth your time to start playing it right now. The amount of headaches you'll have to deal with is a massive turn off for fresh players. Not to mention the community is quite frankly rubbish. There's trolling jerks left and right, along with closet cheaters that mask their cheats as skill in order to make up for their own shortcomings so they can be good at a mere video game. A better time to jump on this game would have been a little over a year ago, but things are improving so it might be new player friendly again sometime soon. Currently the devs are working on updating the core engine of APB: R to make things substantially better from a development point of view, but if they can't make that work and create new content to keep people around... Well, this game won't become the MMO everyone plays and it'll just be another MMO that most people just look at once and say 'nah...'. It's up to you if you want to jump into this game how it is now, as it's rough in a lot of spots but a few things shine so bright.  Game Rating: 7/10 for what the game is capable of, but 5/10 for the community that calls APB:R home.
616	1	a	stole about 1700$ from me  9/11 would pay again
3458	1	a	Very funny game with friends :) 
8697	0	a	You will encounter pro players if you are new in game, those players have plenty of premium and P2W weapons you dont stand a chance and thats why this game is dying all new players, are rage quitting because of that, the devs dont care about it because all the Golds are paying in $ Gold/premium hackers are not getting banned, they get supported by game masters.  roughly 54% of the players are hackers, 30% are Pro players and clans and all the rest are randoms and noobs.   gold players play on silver servers to pwn the regular players, the silvers are mad and play on bronze servers because they are tired of getting owned by golds and the bronze players and trainee players are getting pwnd by both and thats why they are leaving this unfair game, you shoud NOT download this game until they fix it or you will have a very frustrating/painful and hard start into this game, which means you are forced to go this way because they will NEVER fix this issue.
1938	1	a	Fun game when you have nothing else to do. 7/10
9352	0	a	I was dropped into the game with no understanding of it, i was given no useful inforation from the game, i wondered around clicking everything i could and nothing happened. The most fun i had was uninstalling
197	1	a	Great game. Great F2P. People say its a pay to win game but just look in the guides to get free premium codes. Better than GTA in my opinion. So much customization.
3141	1	a	This is an overall great game with all its fun.
4789	0	a	It sucks
515	1	a	This game is truly amazing, but the only thing I hate is that it's hard to find police when you want to just mess around and not do missions, and you start off with very little (which isn't a problem). But everything else is great from the physics, the atmasphere, and others!
8187	0	a	Not really into it, played for an hour got bored cause I have no idea what I'm doing
9703	0	a	can't even login.
3722	1	a	The concept of this game is great, but sadly it's under-developed and underlooked by many people.  A lot of reviews claim that the game is P2W, and while it is true that progression speed is slowed by half when you don't have the bonus premium XP, most of the items that can be found in the ingame store are either purely cosmetic, or reskins/remodels of the weapons that are F2P, sometimes even having inferior stats to those due to the preset mods that come with the cash store models.  An advice to anyone who's considering playing this game though: Do not even think about playing this alone. You'll need to make friends ingame if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest. Playing solo will get old fast, moreso than in other games.
8072	0	a	This game was so bad, it made me write my first review and I've seen some pretty bad games in the years I was on steam  This game got some pretty nice customisation options and decent graphics, but that's about it. Get repetitive about 1 hour in. Worst...controls...ever. Not for solo player. Weapons can only be used for 10 days before breaking down(except the starting ones). Cars drive like a whale on a skateboard. Such a waste of potential...  Go play Defiance instead if you want a third person shooter mmo, better in everything save personalisation.  Ce jeu est tellement merdique que j'ai du Ã©crire une Ã©valuation pour la premiÃ¨re fois, et Dieu sait que j'ai vu de la â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pendant toutes ces annÃ©es avec steam.  Ce jeu a de merveilleuses options de personalisation et de bon graphiques, mais c'est a peu prÃ¨s tout. RÃ©pÃ©titif aprÃ¨s une heure. Pires...controles...jamais...vus. Pas pour les joueurs solos. Les armes ne peuvent Ãªtre utilisÃ©es que pendant 10 jours avant de disparaÃ®tre(sauf celles du dÃ©but. Un beau gachis de potentiel.  Allez jouer Ã  Defiance Ã  la place si vous voulez un mmo de tir a la 3e personne, meilleur en tout sauf la personalisation(qui n'est pas pour autant mauvaise).

3682	1	a	the best game ever I think everybody will like it :} 
8070	0	a	First i would like to say this is one of the best games out there despite the Pay for more mindset of this game. costumization is crazy deep detailed but the default substcription you carry as a new player limits you to 25% of this games costumization capabilities. that aside there is also very anoying mechanics in this game specially playing as a bandit or criminal. a enforcer can handcaff you from miles away limiting your abillity to fight back or even try to brake restrains. little things like this are game braking. i havent spent much time in this game to give you a detailed idea of everything in this game. another thing that really bothers me is the community simply because its mostly filled with a very young community fan base. it bothers me i have to go online and play with 10 year olds. this game has the potencial to be the best game on steam for GTA fans and i think if taken in the right direction it would surpass GTA in many ways. i recommend it for a casual gamer not someone thats looking to take the most out of this game becouse that? .... well thats just impossible unless you â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold bars.......
4370	0	a	Great game, horrible company. Don't trust your wallet and time with these guys, they have banned a lot of good people for doing absolutely nothing. Also, there is only one dev assigned to working on the game, so nothing is getting updated, ever (except for those $50 re-skinned guns that seem to come out every week).
1196	1	a	The game is good yet bad at the same time. When I played it, many months ago, I enjoyed it to an extreme but there were far too many hackers, much less so with the incorporation of Fairfight.. It was a highly P2W game, and still is, but the benefits for paying can easily be countered by guns that you do not have to buy. I used a gun that I got with in-game currency and slaughtered many people that played with weapons they bought using real money. So, the pay to win aspect can be countered by those who do not buy weapons making it still, somewhat fair.  I would love to continue playing the game but I can't. The reason for this is because the company has 3 rank servers set up; bronze, silver and gold. Each of these servers are based on your skill. If you are amazing, you are thrown in the gold server which has very very few people in it, almost none, making it impossible to play. I am a gold, based on my skill, but I can't play because nobody is in the gold server. The only way you can get into the other servers is by dying a lot or joining a silver-ranked friend. I don't have any friends on that game who still play so how can I join them and how can I die if there is nobody in the gold server to play with?  All in all, I like the game but it would not be worth paying for. I recommend that anyone reading this review would try the game, as it is free, but don't put any money down on it. Many people don't recommend the game but people still play it. Check the game out for yourself before judging.
4664	0	a	Not cool.. Why? Never could play on that game and have fun on it... (sadly) Never could make a chracter I like will looks like.. Never works= always crashed..  Never like it Thought - its copy of GTA.. I not like it Saw the multi not liked it thogut ..  Annd my score is 3/10..
10020	1	a	After hundreds of hours invested in this game I can say it's fun, but there are enough flaws to drive away the majority of players. The development of this game stalled after about two years, leaving a playable but unsatisfying experience overall. There are several zones to explore in this game, each offering many different types of missions and rewards. The final zone is a half finished area only accessible by players who have reached the level cap.  Over the years content has been added, including pvp and pve content, allowing players to enjoy hundreds of hours of entertainment. Some of the fixes and additions frustrated some of the more experieenced players and made it nearly impossible for new players to realy enjoy anything beyond the first parts of the game.  Leveling is slow going without help from experienced players. With the right help it's possible to reach the level cap in two days or less. Reaching the skill point cap is a different matter. Plyers will need to dedicate at least a hundred hours to optional races that award points that will improve their character's 'build'. It's important to choose the right build and figure out how to exploit the various skill sets. WIth the right skill set players are able to dominate pvp matches and earn death toll. These pvp points can be spent on power-ups and gear that can't be purhcased or crafted. Some of the pvp gear can be purchased through the auction house for a considerable sum.  Making money is pretty easy with the right recipes. Selling items such as ammo and fuel at the auction house makes it possible to eran money farely quickly, but the best money comes from selling serendipity items and boss loot. Although the best gear and weapons come from earning death toll, the next best thing is crafted with rare and unique items found in the later zones.  I definitely recommend this game for someone looking for a open-world rpg. Although the game is free to play it isn't pay to win. Premium membership does have it's perks though. WIth a minimal premium purchase players can reach the level cap in a few hours, but most premium items are purely cosmetic. Respec injectors are overpriced, so I recommend using guides to make an ideal build from the start. RPG players that enjoy fps games will have may ours of enjoyment even if the graphics are pretty dated.
7377	0	a	Not only did I have trouble getting the game to open, when it did I was presented with a credits screen and then a black screen that persisted for over five minutes. I couldn't alt-tab out of it, my task manager wouldn't open from it, and it wouldn't close via right-click on the task bar so I had to reboot my computer. Immediately uninstalling this defunk software.
435	1	a	This Is A Nice Game I HAvent Played it
2020	1	a	awsome 
10559	1	a	Stop reading this reccomendation and download the game. It's based on high movement speed and jetpacks. (What kind of futuristic game wouldn't have a JETPACK.) It has very fun to play classes AND it's free to play. If I were to rate it I'd give it 150/100. It's super fun to play with friends, so encourage lots of people to download it. Best game ever :)
8032	0	a	Quite an interesting concept, but not my kind of game. Also, I found the graphics &amp; mechanics fairly crude. Mostly tho, as a newcomer, I found it confusing, frustrating &amp; not rewarding, but that could just be my ineptitude at this game. I came to this from Defiance, having heard that this was the better game from that 'stable'. I found Defiance much easier to understand &amp; enjoyed many hours playing it.
8347	0	a	I honestly would NOT recommend this game to new players!   Some Resons Why:  -No balancing system at all -Pay to win -Takes f*ck loads of hours to get a gun decent enough to fight people with -Did i mention pay to win? Oh i did? Its soo pay to win i put it again -Grindy as â¥â¥â¥â¥kkk!!! (it takes wayyy to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing long to get CLOTHES! CLOTHES FOR GOD'S SAKE)  Here are some things that happen in this game.  Only played for about 7 hours, get on to have some fun expecting a balace system, gets into a match, gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ed as soon as it loads up. Holds tab, finds out that they are MUCH higher in rank. Loses match.  If you enjoy all of these things...go ahead and play this game. I still probably will but i still hold firm on saying that new players should NOT play this game unless there is a friend who can guide them.
8783	0	a	It might say I only have 50 hours, but I mostly played without steam on another account. I played atleast 600 hours of APB in total.  Whatever you do, don't play this game. It's trash, such pay to win. The legendary weapons are way too overpowered and expensive, all the free weapons hardly match up and even if they do, they have been buffed with modifications which p2w weapons already have those. Gamers First doesn't fix any bugs in APB, this is the buggiest multiplayer game I have ever seen. They can't even fix the fighting club bug where it reverts your progress when you reach the gold place.  I kept saying to myself : - This game will get fixed one day, it will become even better.  I was wrong. I actually spent some cash on this game just to get banned 3 months later for.... for.... nothing. My account got a random block out of the blue. I wrote a ticket only to be greeted by a bot which simply stated that my account was banned for 3rd party application use. DOES â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SKYPE COUNT??! NO? THEN HOW IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I GOT A PERMA BAN? I am not the first one to be banned for absolutely nothing.   The worst part is that I lost the weapon I bought for over 40$...  The game it self has a great concept, but the company only wants money. Don't even get me started on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t events they do...  Overall, I don't recommend this game for : Poor customer service, in-game p2w shop, sloopy events, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ server/game maintenance, unfair bans.

6760	0	a	it's not really working for me 
3947	0	a	APB Reloaded is a cops and robbers MMO that couldn't quite pull it off. The game has SO much potential that it almost makes me angry when they fall short on almost every game features. The lack of locational damage means accuracy is not needed. Combat often ends in a jumping match, and corner camping is one of the few strategies thanks to the third person camera.   The games micro transaction system and F2P model are majorly flawed. When buying guns in game you rent them allowing you to use it for a set amount of time before you have to rent it again. Buying an account bound weapon costs more but allows any of your characters to use it. This will run you anywhere from 20-55 dollars. You can also purchase character bound weapons for less, these cost about 10-40 dollars. When buying cars you can do the same rent, or own. An account bound car will run you about 15-35 dollars.   All of these prices can be discounted by owning a premium subscription.  Other premium benefits include a 20% off the cost of premium subscriptions, up to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains, 125% bonus to all Cash gains, 20% discount in the Armas Marketplace, 50% reduced cool down on activated abilities (Field Supplier / Nitro Booster), advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol), removal of in-game premium subscription advertising (which pops up at the end of every other mission), extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.  Premium costs about 10 dollars for 30 days and gets cheaper the more time you buy. All in game prices are set in G1C which come in inconvenient amounts to make you buy more or additional packs. An example of this is a non-premium 1 month subscription costs 999 points. You can only get 999 points by buying spending $15 (1200 credits) because $10 is only 800 credits.  The best part of this 3rd person MMO shooter is the customization. While it is extremely limited as a non-premium user you can still add some flavor to your character or vehicle. Premium allows for you to create a truly unique look with 50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. At 100 layers per Symbol.   The in game missions are not over exciting and after playing for about 2-3 hours you will have played all of the available missions. Other players not in your mission are still in the world and can interact with you. They can do things like ram your vehicle or block you in buildings, but it is difficult for them to directly kill you.  The favored anti-cheat system of APB is Punkbuster. This program doesn't work very well at all and allows hackers to run rampant. In my short amount of play time I had encounter roughly 1 hacker per hour.  Overall this game has such a great idea, yet such terrible terrible execution in nearly everything the developers tried to do.

9602	0	a	Downloaded it because I saw so many good reviews. Was a bit dissapointed and I think the game is overrated.  Would've been decent 10 years ago, but now there are other, better games.
9838	0	a	i got the game and i wanted to make a acount on it and i did not use my email on it and it said i did 
9892	1	a	Most people overlook Fallen Earth because its a F2P game, but you'd be suprised what it has to offer. Multiple maps that are extensive in size, the ability to craft over 90% of the items used in-game and the massive amounts of players that join everyday. This is a game I would recomend to any fan of MMORPGs, Post-Apocalyptic games or those who enjoy team combat.

467	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ community, got ran over by a civilian car, teabagging enemies and cancer gameplay. 10/10
6186	0	a	cant even start the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
10075	1	a	I first played this game back in 2012. I Really liked that you can do whatever you want. Do quests, grind and loot all day, craft new stuff, or just have fun in PvP. Fallen Earth reminds you of Fallout 3 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alot, so if you're into any of those games you will most likely enjoy playing Fallen Earth.   The game sadly turned more and more into a Pay 2 Win game after the 2.4 patch. However, you can still enjoy most features without doing any payments, yet it takes longer time for you.  The community is very friendly and extremely helpful if you've got some questions.

2787	1	a	Loads of things to do
685	1	a	idk for but i like gta5 is better my opinon i will say yes its a good game and i like both gta 5 and apb there good games.
2125	1	a	Hate it or love it. ill be there to greet with a Propel rocket to the face &lt;3
2824	1	a	Combine GTA with E-style GunZ and you get this game. It isn't a new game on the street either - its just recently been converted into free2play. Granted, the nearest Asia server is at Hong Kong, but its still hell of a fun and a challenge to drive cars with one second delay on steering. Shooting's fine though, but expect certain moments where you get awkward kills/teamkills. Yep friendly fire's on, no trigger happytarding here.  The tutorial of the game is limited to the point of being inexistent as of writing, but within minutes you should pick up the basics. Theres a (uncompleted) wiki on the game anyway, go check it out for more info  http://www.apbrwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page 
5127	0	a	Close to being one of the best games ever thats why i play it but there is still so much wrong with it 2 traniees vs 2 max rank golds with a OSMAW and Atac
2513	1	a	dont waste as much time as i did on this pile of garbage
9278	0	a	After keeping me busy for over 700 hours and becoming a part of my daily routine, I started becoming leader (quite often) of the Citidel town defence. Went great until I found that I was wasting my time getting nowhere and I don`t want to pay to win in PvP and decided that life was too short.  Figured out that someone willing to pay could have done it all in about 20 hours or someone willing to pay for hacks.   10/10 pay to win or grind simulator
6695	0	a	I thought this game would have good potential...but I was mistaken. The moderators seem to not care too much that 70% of the people playing are cheating using either a program, or macros.   If you ever even encounter people that aren't cheating, you can have a really cool fun shootout that seems realistic, but most of the time you will run into people that gun you down in 3 seconds using a macro or using a cheat program.   The community is horrible, and full of kids feeling entitled to everything that need to be spanked, and disciplined.   The devs really really really need to fix the cheat system (fairfight sucks and takes wayy to long to ban cheaters), and not even unban anyone that has cheated before.
1272	1	a	this game is cool
8536	0	a	Great visuals, lovely sound system, and nice array of weapons. However, the controls are clunky, the cars slide like they're on ice, and the game is heavily stacked against criminals. you can't even keep any guns beyond the starters for more than 10 days. I give it 4/10
10125	1	a	the games sucks u need to make an acount because it doesnt use ur steam acount also when u make an acount it desnt even let u pres create new acount ITS SO STUPID
6451	0	a	plays like a cheap GTA ripoff mixed with the BRINK chatacter modelling.  dont get irritated by the good looking videos,the graphics are old, the controls of the cars are terrible, it feels like the car is always drifting, the animations are bad, the sounds are also bad.  the music is good, also you can do a lot of cusomization.. all together a free hipster kid game thats trying too hard.
9357	0	a	This game is actually awful i'm glad i didn't have to pay for it.
10554	1	a	Best arena shooter I've ever played, and its free! The biggest problem with this game is the lack of people playing it anymore. At least give it a go.
8532	0	a	A few years ago i was like: did you want to play GTA online.. but as a GOOD game not that shity boring GTA... here you go,    Updated version: Became pay so you can win while after a update you have to pay again to win.....
6035	0	a	i don't what the point of this game
8197	0	a	I do not recommend this game unless they remove all but cosmetic items from the cash shop.
10179	0	a	Hm. Logged in once, error and close. Will not log in again. Thanks for the fun times! Edit: its designed to never close properly, so that the hours keep on ticking, and it looks like people are actually playing it. Ill go ahead and label this a harmful program, do not install it.

4119	0	a	This game repeatedly put me in its website to register, when I already had AND downloaded it. This game is stupid and should not take that much effort to play. I went to at least 6 different websites, each one telling me to register.
7409	0	a	just â¥â¥â¥ this thing
6181	0	a	This game is literally the most horrible game ever made by man/woman/aliens/zombies/whatever. It doesn't have a good community the new players gets insulted straight up,  They do not get help from any veteran players, and most of the players who see's the new players will tell them to 'Uninstall' the game and so on.. incouraging players to leave the game even more..  I'd advice GamersFirst or whoever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ runs this company's game. To take action to those who violates the term of 'Respecting New Comers to the game'  Its a thing, Please try to put it to good use. I don't see this game going anymore further in the future.. The community in this game is horrible and it literally needs a reality check. So help me, take this game down if this game gets out of hand with 'Insult every new player that steps in the game'  My rating? Not a recommended game. To those who wish to learn how to get started with the help of veteran players.  It's also P2W, So forget about it.
10822	1	a	it is really goood
6396	0	a	Got me a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Virus and Error,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,i recommend,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,i recomend again.
10683	1	a	got the game lost all matches  10/10
8373	0	a	I have about 500 hours on this game and I can say at the start it is really pay 2 win but later on the Weapons you are able to modify can be WAY better than the Premium Weapons.If you dont have money for GTA 5 and look for an alternative....Dont get this game it will cost more than GTA 5 later on but if you have friend definitly play this Game! Anyway a Dislike because of the Prices!!!
2129	1	a	Awesome game, free version of GTA? probably.. yes sometimes you might get mad at this game but think again, at least your playing something. 
6175	0	a	This game is too old need upgrade charaters,graphics and cars XD
3100	1	a	This game is like free cancer
857	1	a	Very Nice
3812	0	a	Pros: + Free to play + Kinda like GTA Online + Fun to ram pedestrians + I can play Pokemon GO Song and ram stuff  Cons: - Microtransactions - You need to pay to actually get some kills - Microtransactions - Did I mention microtransactions?  Edit: Forgot to mention the microtransactions.
4070	0	a	Don't use any money on this game, EVER. GamersFirst will most likely take your account and ban it for some random reason they can come up with in 20 minutes, or you'll get yourself banned for receiving messages from someone on the other team screaming cuss words at you.  Gameplay is complete crap, and it's the most pay 2 win game I've ever seen. If you do not wish to spend countless hours every day grinding missions with absolutely useless weapons until you're almost max-ranked, so you can actually use some decent weapons with good modifications and a nice car, you'll have to pay insane amounts of money on weapons or cars. 
166	1	a	I have been playing APB reloaded on and off steam for a while. I will state the following:   PROS:   If you enjoy enhanced character customization and opposing enemy players in non-stop PVP this game is for you. The detail of character customization, Vehicle customization, Clothing retexture is abundant, Moreso than most MMO's I've ever played. atleast one server seems to be densely populated at all hours of the day, There are always players online. You get a fully customizable soundtrack to play from your vehicle. The open world crimes and witness events give the game play immersion.  CONS: There are hackers who use aimbot sometimes, Allthough most get banned with the new anti-cheat system some bypass it or return on a fresh account. When you're a low level in the bronze district as bronze threat level, Gold threat level players equipped with preimum gear will camp you and kill the crap out of you, you'll be lucky to last five seconds without being picked off after respawn in some matches. As far as the community is concerned, Like most MMOs or FPS's Such as Call of duty or WoW, Players can be really disrespectful via district chat or mic, predictably Some can be very cancerous and toxic with thier insults and PM's, These players are usually team killers and generally will try to bring down the whole team, Not that I care but people who aren't like me who aren't desensitized to it will. Not that i'm sure it matters in this type of game, But there is no RPG element to the game, You'd have to think, There are NPC interactions in this game verbal and physical, Mugging, Diolouge, Contacts, Mail from contacts. Why is there no NPC missions or PVE? I'd probably play this game A lot more if it did have an RPG element to it and Solo missions. Sometimes I don't want to PVP, the same routine kind of gets boring after a short wile.  Conclusion: Despite the cons, I'd still reccomend APB reloaded. After all it is ranked #1 in most top 10 character generation videos, I have a lot of fun doing open world crime or when on my enforcer arresting players who commit crimes. The game itself is more adult oriented and more to my level of prefrence, Something you rarely see at all in today's games.
4002	0	a	This mmo is totally unbalanced, and is pay to win. I don't recommend it.
4844	0	a	I love APB, but the game managers doesn't even care about their customers.
2401	1	a	Its not Pay 2 Win , at first i thought so but if u spend some time in the game look up some methods to gain money everything is buyable
1787	1	a	GET IT OF U LUV GTA 
936	1	a	^_^
10678	1	a	''P1: I am the greatest!  P2: No. P3: No. P4: No. P1: Shazbot!''

1184	1	a	CANT WAIT TO PLAY OMGGGGGGGG
9204	1	a	Free and great ,what do u want more ? :D
4261	0	a	This game is buggy even with decent hardware. Apart form that, it has tons of security holes which means hackers can easily deface this game. And the punkbuster is a wase of time. Plus, it has become a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pay to win.
4770	0	a	The worst company =&gt; Unnecessary gamersfirst =&gt; Inane apb rel... They do not deserve you
8869	0	a	This was a tough one to recommend or not, but I'm going to have to go with no. I wanted to say yes, and I would have, only if the Devs paid more attention to newer people who play the game for the very first time. I will first start off with a Pros/Cons list  Pros:  Decent Graphics HUGE map Good combat (not just point in click, you actually have to aim and shoot) Factions is a neat idea ontop of clans PvP is for the most part, actually about skill Lots of things to do at max level  Cons:  HUGE map, but not much in it Melee is SO overpowered Can't trust faction members, you have half chance of them betraying you Not nearly enough support at lower levels (will explain later) Rude community GM's don't do much Horrible customer support (will explain later)  Now, when I say 'Not nearly enough support at lower levels' I mean that there has been so many updates in the game to keep higher level'd people to keep playing, example, the G.O.R.E. update (that whole update was a mess), while there's no updates or anything for lower level'd people, the game has a decent tutorial system, but just like anything, a tutorial can only help so much, you actually need to do it to get better. If you want to craft, you need to scavenege in PvP areas for certain things and people usually just camp there waiting for people to show up to get stuff to craft and waste them before they even know what happens. The economy is pretty messed up, ammo, which costs nothing to make really, is sold for a pretty pricey amount, I understand supply and demand but holy crap, it's hard to get money as a lower level so ammo isn't going to be cheap for them.  Customer support... It literally means 'customer support' if you're a f2p, they don't give a flying â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you, (it's kind of like TF2, if you buy a single item from the online store, you unlock things, such as no money limit and all that), in fact, unless you bought something or have a subscription, you can't even file a ticket! Even people who are paying a montly fee for the game, they barely care about you. GM's hardly do anything to help you, but they do throw bans left and right on a power hungry trip. The community is rude, 80% of the people there are the ones who have still played when the game is P2P so they thing they're better than everyone in general.  As for factions, there are Techs, Travelers, Light Bearers, Enforcers, CHOTA and I forget what the last one is called, they're kind of like hippies, anyways, each one has a natural ally and a natural enemey, Techs hate the hippies, but Techs are allied with Travelers, but Travelers hate Light Bearers, etc etc, but unfourtantely none of that matters since if you if you're a Traveler, you'll get freaking shot up by another Traveler, otherwise the whole faction thing would be an awesome idea.  I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like 'Why is he even saying this?' Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it  Edit: Typos and added a statement in the 'Customer Support' part
2035	1	a	It wont start when i open the game it says the game is down for a maintrance. I have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what so ever how to fix it. this is to Gamersfirst. so i have nothing to say about this game, hope you guys like it B cus i cant...
8222	0	a	Very fun untill you run into people who need to make up for their lack of skill by buying grenade launchers with real money. Game ruined, ggwp.
1968	1	a	Honestly gta 1 was better than this.
2118	1	a	great for when you want a cause of suicide!
6499	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
1183	1	a	Great multiplayer shooter with ok ghraphics so you wont need a great computer to play. Though it is a VERY VERY glitchy game evreytime i hijack a car then go out to shoot the person they dissapear and not only that when i go to hijack a car then i see a better one i stop person dissapeared again! PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME. Would higly recomend  4.3/5
5895	0	a	it does nt work its junk waste of time 
4552	0	a	This. Is NOT one of the good ones. Beta was great, now its just full of P2W items and teamkilling â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sure the reviews are ''mostly postive'' but aint nothin positive about this game.
2793	1	a	-Pros Good open world with lots of landmarks and combat-friendly areas Fun car controls &amp; car variety Lots of stuff to do Music player in vehicles is pretty cool Amazing customization of characters and cars  -Cons Pay to win Really bad servers (although they're getting better) Unoptimized, lag spikes (even on great hardware) Takes several minutes to launch for some machines 
545	1	a	Best customization ever :)
4019	0	a	I haven't played this using steam but over my two accounts I have over 1500 hours and it spans from 2011-2013 , and then rest of my second account is all from late 2014 to 2015.  The game had a lot of potential but the increasingly poor decisions of the people in charge are really putting the nail in the coffin as time goes on. The game was playable and enjoyable, FPS was good and there wasn't any lag. The game has cheaters but what F2P game doesn't?   Then as time goes on you lost FPS with every patch, you can no longer play on ultra settings but need to play it on low with a special launcher that reduces textures even further, I have upgraded my rig since I've first started playing and the performance I get is absolutely laughable. The servers, for more than a month, have been having aboslutely awful connection problems due to getting 'ddosed' ( doubt it, probably just a lie) which result in constant ping spikes and people constantly teleporting around.  But as the game continues to go down the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, you can guarantee there will still be sales on the Armas marketplace so they can try and squeeze every last penny out of you before you get fed up and leave because of sheer lack of progress, transparency, and GM's that actually play the game.  Save yourself the heartbreak, maybe if you could get in a time machine and play it early 2013 you would be happy, but the state it is in now is absolutely unplayable. It's sad to see what it has become, but it's just how it is when you have clueless fools in charge.
5578	0	a	I did write a very bad review on this game. THIS IS WHAT I WROTE. I have over 3000 hrs in this game, threat gold. If you like playing a game with 12 year olds ramming you with their car, trolling, no good teamwork then this game is for you. If you like playing on a outdated laggy engine this game is for you. If you like playing with crap guns that are totally unrealistic then play this game. People will say this game has skill, but what is the skill is the question?. Their isnt any. If you know how to tap fire, duck, move left to right, camp, spray, sneak up and steal your teammate's kill then you will be pro. In mission districts all the gold threat players play in the silver district. The gold district is 0 in population. You have players that will dethreat to silver to just go to the bronze district to troll with osmaws. The game is very unpopulated also.    Gamersfirst support sucks. I got scammed awhile back I was trying to trade a N-HVR Reaper for another lengend, I contacted gamersfirst support, and reported the incident and they took care of that and I got my gun back. Got scammed again and contacted support. I was trading a condor for another legend. And I showed them proof of that incident. And they told me that they would be glad to help me. They banned the person yeah. But I did not get back my gun. They told me that they were sorry that the restoration of my item wasn't available at the moment. So I messaged them back and told them about how I got my lengendary back before when I was scammed. They replied saying they only do it one time. If they only do it just one time. They should just ban ingame trading or make a trade system. Because people spend alot of money on joker boxes for legendarys, and you have people that has spent alot of time getting legendarys.      The good things about this game are. 1. Great Charactercustomization 2. Only game I know with a music studio 3. Good symbol designer, if you have premium 4. Car constumization, but very few cars. 5. Good clothing designer if you have premium. If you don't have premium you are limted on what you can do.  BUT STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. This game is not that bad its just Gamersfirst that makes it bad. It's an actual really good game. Just owned by the wrong people. It's very unique game. No game is like it. I'm not going to say don't play. Play it because if this game gets more populated it may get better one day. I feel like if it died. It would stay dead forever. I don't want that to happen. I know the weapons aren't very realistic but that may change one day. Who knows. Maybe if the engine update really happens; maybe it will fix alot of things and make it better. I can only hope so. BUT PLAY IT. IGNORE ALL THE BAD REVIEWS. ITS NOT THAT BAD. THIS GAME WILL JUST MAKE YOU SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT IT. AND YOU WILL COME BACK PLAYING IT. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU WILL.   Thinking about it again though â¥â¥â¥â¥ This game!!! Old piece of crap that they aren't ever going to fix and update. It's a joke on Xbox after watching gameplay videos of it it lags worse than it does on PC.
5388	0	a	Looking for a newb friendly game? Well turn your head around and never look at this game. Unless you got some mates willing to help you out that are NOT newb players cause when a game got you struggling on the tutorial by yourself you won't be gettin far. But aye the game at least puts you right into the heat of things and the action. Why that was the most action packed 1.6 hour experience of my life....yay.

8942	0	a	I played this game for many years before hand and when you see it now. The game is just a barren husk with no content to show for the years I've been away. Nothing new to make me enjoy it also. Everything is now just, boring in it.   Go with Fallout, you'll have more content at your hands than this game ever will.
3815	0	a	This game has been consistently made worse over the past ~year, with the biggest problems being ignored in favor of introducing more 50$ 'content' of questionable quality.  Avoid.
5978	0	a	First to start off I played 14 hours of this game and let me tell you IT ISNT FOR EVERYONE! The game has a weird learning curve but anyone who is good can beat p2w players. The game in my opinion is not recommended for the casual gamer of for someone who can buy gta 5 seriously this game is awful its just a game that I wish the devs got hernias.
1630	1	a	Unlike said, the game is still playable and not p2w
7276	0	a	-Weapon balance is â¥â¥â¥â¥  -MatchMaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥  those two points ruins the entire game.
596	1	a	IMMA SLIME
5789	0	a	GAME IS JUST WAY TO OVERRATED .JUST A CRAPY EXAMPLE OF COMPANYS FAILS TO CREATE SOMTHING NEW RATHER THAN TRING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER GTA UNISTALL THIS GAME WHILE YOU CAN IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND SPACE WELL IF YOU DONT CHEW BIG RED THEN â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU..LOL
1251	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
8599	0	a	Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥in play this game  is cancer  I broke a chair

1221	1	a	I rate it 12/10, why you wonder?  Man, that feeling when you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ grind money for a car and you see one troll that wants to enter in it and he can't, I was very satisfied, until a freaking R250 cop comes and 1v5 us like we were some training dolls.   I repeat 12/10   Best story ever. I loved this game until I played it. :D
4953	0	a	This game should still be in its alpha stage with how bad it is. The company doesn't do anything to help improve it. All they do is add crap pay 2 win guns that no one uses and skins. Barely any game fixes the game requires. If you going to play this game prepare to rage quit all the time, yell, scream, throw small children and light you pants on fire. Game started out fine then when south... fast. I have wasted so many hours and so much money that I am embarrased to talk about it. I would rate it about a -13 out of 10 but I can't sadly. So good luck GamersFirst, I mean GamersNever and I hope your company burns down one day out of overclocking those toasters you call servers.
3664	1	a	Nice game!
9845	0	a	The game isnt even the glitchyist part... The launcher was. After I signed out for my first time and tried to sign back in I was forced to uninstall the game and redownlad it. But other than that one part it was a good game.
4721	0	a	Was fun in 2010-2012, wont be checking it out in 2015  Just say your goodbyes and go to Grand Theft Auto: Online
1290	1	a	Its pretty much a free version of GTA V if your too poor to afford GTA V  My first day.. Walk out of the Station...see three pimped out Super cars drag racing down the street...one hits a car, flips over, and exploads... Me: I think I'm gona like this game!  Second Day... Walk out of the Station...See a pimped out van driving down the streets with 2 guys hanging out the sides unloading their weapons into whoever is chaseing them...Whos chasing them? two pimped out Super cars with sirens blaring...one hit a car, flips over and explodes... Me: Yep...I'm definitly gona like this game...
10281	1	a	i want to play this game but im confused on how to sign in, i made an account to play, can someone please help me on how to sign in.
8379	0	a	This game sucks so bad omg , it looks fun but once u start playing it.. its so boring and lame
1117	1	a	Like GTA, customizing,Cars,ETC this Game is for you It's like GTA But better Get this game it's free!
5141	0	a	Pay to Win piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Uninstalling immediately
7729	0	a	Pay2Win in every sense of the word, I can't really recommend it for anything besides playing with close friends.  Amazing customization though, so if you're into that, you might still get some fun out of it.
2197	1	a	Love tHis GTA Based Free To Play Game :)
2563	1	a	This game is one of the best mmo games in my opinion. It's a third person shooter in the great city of San Paro. This game includes so much customization. You can tune your car, buy some clothes and make music and share it all. You can choose between an enforcer and a criminal with both their own gameplay elements. You can choose various guns out of a huge arsenal of weapons. This game is also free, so don't doubt to download this beauty and try it out yourself.
3277	1	a	This game very good i play so much and someday it crash always crash and no one want help me i very very play this game when i playing and crash Dricx_invallcall i dont remember please anyone can help me   my PC core i5 2.50ghz ram 4GB and video card intel hd family 4000 (intel hd 4000) please help me fix this crash
10167	0	a	Don't get this game. I got this thinking it would be like the online version of fallout. I was ever so wrong. The interface is confusing, enemy spawning is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it altogether is a giant pile of mutant dung.
4680	0	a	Not cool.. Why? Never could play on that game and have fun on it... (sadly) Never could make a chracter I like will looks like.. Never works= always crashed..  Never like it Thought - its copy of GTA.. I not like it Saw the multi not liked it thogut ..  Annd my score is 3/10..
8261	0	a	piece of crap
9389	1	a	It's okay for a game that came out way back in 2009 before being on steam; it's one of those long and slow progressing games ~ While you can level your toon pretty fast early on ~ you'll reach the slow grind and long crafting around lvl20. That's where I first gave up looking at the recipes taking 1-2days in real life with subscription boosts to craft.  It's more so a game you play when you had enough of Fallout 3 and moved on to Fallout New Vegas ~ then had enough of Fallout New Vegas for the moment [mods and the DLC will keep you busy for hours] ~ then you move on to Fallen Earth giving that a couple of hours ~Then back to Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 [steam sale going at the time of this post]  Note: No new content ~ Generally quiet ~ but the servers are still up so you can always pop in and check if you finally crafted your component ~ then craft the next 2 day wait component I have clocked about 110+ hours over the last 2 weeks ~ maybe 3 of them was actual game play the rest was waiting in craft [Not kidding] or travelling to a new lifenet pod city to get more recipes~ I've increased my Cooking level both in game and in real life during this time
7167	0	a	The game looks cool just that I can't play the game it just crashes 
7933	0	a	This entire game is based off of the classic 'MMO' grinding. This doesn't translate very well into a GTA 'cops 'nd robbers' setting. This game has so many flaws, 80% of my time playing this was just trying to get it open based on multiple launches. It's not worth the download time and the stress. Don't play this. Jesus christ, between the loading times and the god damned lag when driving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing -CAR-, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE EASILY, MIND YOU, this game is a mess. It needs to be pulled into the backyard and shot OR redone from the ground up, which is something I -KNOW- won't happen. God damned. I'm never going to get this time back from my life.  I give it a ten because I'm a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot.
5737	0	a	A game that caters to people that aren't you. It will never be you. The game itself is broken at the core and the devs never bothered to fix it, because they are catered in turn by people who aren't you.  In this game you are a statistic in someone else's killrate. It's a round of Counter Strike where you only have a knife and all the other kids have deagles.  Skip this junk and save your hardware from inevitable physical rage violence.
7673	0	a	I'M FROM PLANET VEGETA
8739	0	a	Best Horrible Game so Far ...
8583	0	a	Alright game but most of this is pay to win.
3823	0	a	All I know is after 44 hours (some more if you include the hours I palyed before I played on steam) I was about ready to flip my desk. I had a bigger reveiw earlier, but apparently it was inaccurate. If you are good at this game, good for you. The newbs hate you, and you enjoy your time on the game. Me? This game is only fun for customization. Nothing else, considering I can land one bullet on some veteran players.  BUT I CAN'T STOP â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PLAYING!
6434	0	a	A total pay to win.
4663	0	a	When you first start out, it's kinda unfair, start a mission and boom, in the game with higher ranked players with basically OP weapons... People kill you in less than 3-4 hits.  How can this be fair to a new player? Now I wonder why it had mixed reviews.
1642	1	a	I love this game! rank 200+ . Amazing video btw ;) like the music. Totaly good game.. Maybe get better Physics?? because sometimes my cars flyin of just touching stuff :P
711	1	a	Not a bad game
371	1	a	One of the most addictive open-world games I've played in a really long time. APB is great fun and packed full of unlockable in-game material such as vehicles, clothes, weapons, and many others. Plenty of features to keep you occupied for a very long time. Best part: It's free. Highly recommended.
8460	0	a	When i click play on steam it dosnt even turn on so i go on task manager to close it and it dose or at least it says it dose, and steam still says that its running so please dont bother with it.
4415	0	a	APB is one of those game where you enjoy and like it but you still can't recommend it because it has some issues. I'm just gonna list the pros and cons so you don't have to kill yourself after reading this review.  Pros ======= - Customization, you can do anything really. - Ragdoll physic - You can play with your friends  Cons ======= - Terrible matchmaking, have fun going against 3 golds with 2 silvers on your team - Pay2Win effect is present though to a lesser extent - Unoptimize even after 4 years, one of the feats that makes me wanna jump off the Eiffel Tower - Hackers are present but not much - A lot of reskin weapons like seriously? - Where is the engine update? - Server can be a bit laggy at times (yes, I already check it. It isn't my internet)  TLDR ========== - Play the game if you want, I'm not gonna stop you. It has its problem but it's enjoyable, atleast for me, I suppose.
2987	1	a	While hackers run rampant in this F2P and there is occasional lag, as a shooter game it's one of my favorites. GTA type gameplay, full customizable options, can be easily played solo or with a group.
7389	0	a	Was terrible. My Computer is waayyyyyy beyond reccomended specs and I have good internet too. Is nothing like it says it is. Completely pointless
7742	0	a	.....
5143	0	a	Don't
3512	1	a	Pro: it's really fun if u like gun shooting and driving a cool car in one game. Great customization. Many detail for making character, car painting/designing, and music. Best primary guns are free, NSFA/OCA(short range guns), HVR(snipe gun), n-tech/sr15(mid range guns)  con: High computer system requirement. Some guns aren't free. Colby CSG(longer range shotgun), DMR-AV(snipe gun that can deal great damage to cars), Colby .45 AP(best mid range secondary), N-SSW(more stable LMG and w/o slowing too much movement speed). Bad matchmaking. (gold rank players are in silver or even bronze rank districts. Playing 2nd day can put u in a match against max level gold rank....) advance too easy(from bronze to silver and then to gold). Newbies&amp;noobs like me are still trying to figer this game out but we are advanced to silver or even gold. You could even advance if the match was lost. Climbing ladders can be distrupted by teammate. (When this happens too often to me, it makes me shoot my teammate) Latency got higher since server merge(US server)  conclusion:  if u care about winning much, u gotta be very good at the game and team up with other pros.  If u dont care about win/lose, its a fun game to play.
1150	1	a	Good: It's a good game with a big map. You can play with you freinds and spend a holy day of you life on this game!  Could be better: I think the should remove Auto-ready.  Stars: 4,5 out of 5   :D good game   Signed DanishAllstarsGaming 
5516	0	a	Dont ever ever play this game it is made only for ppl who pay money,if u just want to get it for free and play it u will get dominated and killed then killed,killed.....
6189	0	a	This game is gay. An need to fix their hackers problem. IF I HAD BROUGHT THIS GAME I WOULD SEND A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT. SAYING: F!!!!!!! U!!!!!!!! . BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF IT. JUST GET RID OF HACKERS! 0/10 for now. Ps people reading this I dont care about grammer.
2994	1	a	its like a ex wife thats really hot, you play it for one part that turns into a addiction and hate all the other parts.
6614	0	a	This game is being slamed (mainly because of it being a bad remake), but could still be fixed if was done well. First off, this game has the option to make your own charater, clothes, music, cars, and clans... But it mainly makes you work for these items by making you grind missions or paying money. This game also lets you use weapons and steal cars, but it's as fun as it's intended... See where I'm getting at.  Also the game gets buggy with good or bad connection (even with the graphics on low), it's like you need a supercomputer to use it (just like summer wars).  I will give it a 6/10, but though I don't reccomend it, I am sure someone is going to play it because I said so... Go enjoy the rocks you use as soap, because thats how dumb you are to play this... I am still gonna play it though (to make it better of course).
1939	1	a	I got killed by jumping off a 1 story building  10/10
7458	0	a	It's bad. Just that.

8734	0	a	Addictive but also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ttingly frustrating at times. Rounds usually aren't very fair.  Probably wouldn't waste my time on it again.
7452	0	a	This game dont have something what destroy this game -this game dont have good match making so you will se 50,49,85 versus 245,200,180 
4434	0	a	You know how when a horse breaks its leg, you're supposed to shoot it? Yeah, that was APB from the start. And then they tried to perform necromancy on it. But that didn't fix its broken leg. Now it's just rotting AND crippled.  Sure, you can dress your zombie horse up however you want. Give it a little hat. Try to pretend it's alive and well. But the truth remains; It's not. Every moment it exists is a plea to stop its unending torment.
1907	1	a	Great game, near limitless possibilities for customization, a lot of potential, skill based shooting system, customized cars, clothes, songs, blasting pokemon random encounter music every time I kill someone... Greatness &lt;3
6190	0	a	Full of with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  So one of my friend told me this game is not pay2win at all,but its not true. So lets talk about 1 gun for now,wich is one of my favorite. The shotgun. So if you compare the JG tactical shotgun with the Colby CSG,they're 2 different weapons.  The colby CSG is almost like a damn sniper shotgun,but the JG tactical cannot do anything like that.  Thanks g1,you just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up an another game.
2755	1	a	Summary: In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter! 
1782	1	a	Pretty good game except for the fact that it kills my pc just trying to run it.
1834	1	a	i dislike that when loaded the game doenst show it self full screen and i cant open it but still plays and i cant control it
155	1	a	They have improved it alot, the game is quite fun, not a game to play for too long in a row but its a game you would stick to for such a long time ^^ 
6809	0	a	while the game itself is good, with great character customization. it's a massively pay to win mess. you have to pay real money to get decent guns. and the only way to get those guns without paying them wheel barrels of cash are to get joker tickets. and to get those, you need to play for hours almost non stop in one of their special gamemodes. most likely against hackers. the pay to win vehicles that as far as i know, can't be bought with tickets, have massive built in ability that vastly out perform the non play to win vehicles. the community is cancerous that gives LoL a run for it's money. you will no doubt be accused of hacking at least once, regardless of if you're actually hacking. the actual hackers basically rule the game while gamer's first has money shoveled in from overpriced P2W ingame guns and cars.
8560	0	a	APB Reloaded for dummys 1 download the game 2 sign in 3 fail signing in 4 make an account 5 sign in again 6 fail signing in sign in 7 fail signing in 8 realise you needed to confirm your email 9 confirm your stupid email 10 sign in for the last friggin time! 11 finally it works... 12 create your character anticipating that it has the best creation system ever 13 start the game with a crappy character 14 game lags like friggin crazy!! 15 realize, it wasn't love at first sight 2/10
9884	1	a	Great game lots of fun, Although somepeople pay2win, It's a lot funner too play through without paying a thing. Great crafting system, Great combat. Overall 10/10. :)
7944	0	a	lulz this game was good, and only fun to the hackers
618	1	a	this game is the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever it's max competitiv and can make your pant max wet, Sadly fairfight the anticheat system is dumb and noob banning only free cheats or payant cheats with bad seting. it's back in its old state years ago full of trigerbot ,aim bot (smooth) macro and more++++ but beat one of these fakers is a great feel, so APB&gt;all games get on it be patient time=skills in this game don't mind of weird communauty you will get fun as you never has before 8,5/10 CBT VETERAN 21000 hours 143000 kills feel free to contact me in game for help.

8956	1	a	Still waiting for that Fallout Online pipedream?? While it may be on its way with a- and lets be honest, long overdue announcement. Fallen Earth is here to scratch away those Post-Apocolyptic itching blues.
