6104	0	a	Call me hard to please, but this game was stupid. I spent half an hour standing around shooting at things and breaking store fronts but had no clue where to drop off the TV's I stole. Also, you have NO CHOICE but to be thrown into a team and HAVE to complete objectives with people you dont even know. I HATE that. I want to roam free doing my own thing, not pair up with some dude who's already screaming his lungs out because 'everyone on the server sucks'  More team based crap full of elitist players who just SCREAM or talk crap. Skip this if you're looking for an open world game with lots to do.
10763	1	a	With this all new patch, I'd say Tribes is back in action. Less gun mess, More skill needed.
10152	1	a	Helluva lot of fun with friends. Or making friends inside. Big roleplaying community. Combat is very different, guns are difficult to use in a run and gun fashion, but it's mostly simple.
2530	1	a	Great game just like gta and its free what more do you want
6587	0	a	Kind of a grind.
10086	1	a	This is a really god post apoctalyptic MMO.Its often fun and interesting especialy if your playing with some friends.Its like a mashup of fallout 3,minecraft and an MMO.Its a fun game and i would give it a 9 out of 10 and i recommend it.
5298	0	a	If you like cops and robber pvp sure this is the game for you. Although, be warned that the damage system is all f*ck up and will only make you say WTF at every gun fight you enter.   Don't waste your time and money on this game, it doesnt worth it.
6011	0	a	Another p2w, pile of trash, only this time, its the revival of the fastest mmo to ever be shut down. Thats always a beacon of confidence.

4289	0	a	Great concept, poor execution.   If you're lucky, you'll have a good, fair experience with other free players. However, you'll probably match up with some premium guy with an LMG and a rocket launcher, effectively eliminating your chances at victory or a good time.  The biggest problem is the developers with the pay2win style.  If this was remade by literally anyone else I'd prefer it to GamersFirst.

9689	0	a	Take Fallout, WoW &amp; STALKER and throw them in the trash. The result is this game.
3262	1	a	why is the gun play still so bad in this game, no such thing as accuracy at any distance and no patern at all. The best example being, assult rifle at close range kills full health enemy instant even when they have a high power shotty and fired first, the next day same senario but at a distance with shotty killing enemy with full health out side of shotty range. Love the rest of the game but the gun play is maddening at best with its lack of consistency...... i recommend only based on customization only.
8798	0	a	This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.
9971	1	a	Free to Play version (no limitations, you're only faster leveling up if you're premium) of Fallout.

4154	0	a	There was once a time when this game was full of potential with lots of promises made to the playerbase. Now that potential is wasted and lots of promises forgotten.  Its all pay to win with endless grinding for those not willing to invest hundreds of euros in to this dying game.  Really awesome customization though. Gotta pay for that premium first though.  And then some.  But after all that said. I've had much love for this game since the real time worlds first launch. Even though it is repetive to the max there was something that kept you going to the next mission and try again.
664	1	a	 First of all, I would like to say I have not spent any real money on this game. I haven't bought any DLC or In-Game Purchases.   Me and my friends really enjoy this game. We love doing missions together, and having to take down enemies. We definatley reccomend it, you don't have to pay to have fun.  Here are some reasons to try out the game -    3 Huge Maps   Ride in teamate's cars   Heaps of Character Customization   Vehicle Upgrades   Realistic Models   Crews - Paint your emblem on your car/clothes   Loads of Weapons   Fast pace shooter action   Dozens of cars to unlock and buy   Shooting out of car windows   You can smash into stores and rob them   Emotes   Good Sound FX   Play your own music in cars   You can be police and arrest people   Good amount of national servers   Alot of co-op missions against other teams   You can sometimes play missions by yourslef with no enemies   You don't need a beast computer to run it  
7141	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ took 8 hours too dowload and wouldn't even let me run it
4984	0	a	Fun, until you run into a mission with hackers, and aimbotters. Leans towards the Pay2Win side quite heavily.
3355	1	a	Grills, kills and glitches. +300 rep for grills -100 rep for glitches 9/11 points
4382	0	a	If a game were possible to be cancer, this would be it. I loaded the game, fell ill immediately, checked myself into a cancer treatment hospital and died. 0/10 would not play ever again.
631	1	a	Great way to past time really with friends this denf a squad game. c;
7784	0	a	To start off with, the game has its good parts and its bad parts, like every other game. But this game is not just like the others. I will start with the Pros. This game offers you the ability to customize clothing,cars,weapons as much as you want, and honestly, i haven't seen many games with so much customization. Its gameplay is one that will get you addicted. Now , for the Cons. Every one has heard of MMOs. They are supposed to let you customize and buy new content with in-game cash, and if you want to access some premium content to pay some money(for them to make some cash). This game has an incredibly greedy publisher, also known as Gamersfirst. They are all about money and they don't care about the players. The support is absolutely TERRIBLE. Their stuff added into the game is absolutely POINTLESS, as it adds more lag to the game and the framerate sometimes in a shootout can reach 2! For me, i have a great computer and high-speed internet, and it still happens. But it's not enough for this game. All these continuous patches make the game harder to enjoy, because it adds lag, as mentioned before. I've been playing this game for about 300 hours. I know that's not a lot, but i've added some cash into this for the premium, and i deeply regret it. I got my account hacked and when i contacted support all they said 'We will work on the case and we will inform you! Thank you for calling Gamersfirst!', and then they never got back to me with any news. I tried contacting again but they refused to help the second time. They didn't want to hear about it. Also the players in this game are acting like absolute garbage. You'll never get by without being criticized when you have a good score and you're owning the opposition. They will always say : 'You're a hacker!'; 'You're a noob!'; 'F*** YOU!'. In my opinion, and i think a LOT of you guys who have played this game, i think you will agree with me. THIS GAME IS GARBAGE!!
7638	0	a	Coustomizations in this game are awesome... but unless you REALY REALY love dieing over and over to Rocketlaunchers and Sniper fire then you probablly wanna find another game to satisfy your Medium to short range game play. Long range dominates in this game. If you dont mind repetitive deaths and not even seeing where 1/2 of it comes from... then this games for you!   Oh BTW you dont get a sniper rifle or rocket launcher starting out... you have to work your way to them. Oh yeah, and you dont get xp unless you win against these people! so Happy gaming!
5416	0	a	dont spend time on that game. full of hackers. anti cheat ban you when you get over 50 reports. this game fall into a wrong hands (GamersFirst)
2486	1	a	This game is great fun and you easily get hooked to it. Both maps are amazing and teamwork strives in this game. The customization is epic and will get you editing you characted/cars for hours. The major problem to this game is that it is a pay to win, if you are going to spend some money, think twice.
714	1	a	Was good for me, but they have to fix the people you get matched against... I don't like getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.

I loved the game for the customisation but it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ OATJAOWJTWA  Edit: I actually have far more than the 23 hours on steam, I have around 400 hours in this game
10548	1	a	This game was and still is the game that saved pc gaming for me. I love this game (even when I played on a toaster) so much and the newest update changed the game in a way that I could reimagine the whole game. I recommend this game if you want to have a fast paced game and countless hours of highspeed battles travelling in ridicoulus speeds.
10359	0	a	Eh. Played for a few hours. Not as fun as I thought it'd be. Slow - paced, boring roleplay game. Not recommended.
1203	1	a	It is so so.
206	1	a	this game is great but when i start it half of the buildings dont load so its like an invisible maze 
8580	0	a	Less fun more frustrating. I bought this back in 2010 like an idiot just before the original creators went bust, and the new owners G1 have added nothing of value in the 6 years they have been running it
7543	0	a	took loads of space took forever to load and was terrible once loaded 0/100000000000
1171	1	a	Recommended for Free2Play and casual play.   After pushing myself to try this game out for a couple of hours it just didn't have what it took to pull me in and keep me entertained. This style of MMO can be fun but it is very obvious that APB Reloaded is a 'take and hold' type of game with a p2w factor included.   I do appreciate a game of this quality to be free2play however and the devs did a nice job in the creation of something better than a quest to collect and bring back flowers. The quests are easier to understand after a bit of time invested but very obvious that development could be better in terms of questing.  If you are looking for a way to kill time by the same objective over and over in a GTA-limited style, then this game is for you and there is no problem with that. In my opinion, it just doesn't have that hook I look for in games.  
7559	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, it crashes like crazy... and i couldn't even start it.. no wonder it's free... DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
2971	1	a	loce this game
9615	0	a	This looks like a very interesting game to play, unfortunately, I don't know that for certain. Each time that I move my character the game locks up. Not just the locks but it locks up my whole computer so that I have to restart it. Fix that and I'll try it again. Until then I can't recommend this game at all.
3080	1	a	the game never launches for me =(
2247	1	a	When you lose, you can mug some people. Best way to chill.

3167	1	a	WTF!!!!!  Best game I have played in a LONG time, and the game is an endless world of Murder and Missions, along with ULTRA Customization for Cars, Clothes and Facial/Body features.
6964	0	a	never loads my people
8103	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. The shooting mechanics are horrible, and the objective fighting is bland. For something that shouts out MMO GTA it just feels empty as hell, with the largest battle I had being two versus two. SHIITTTTT
4404	0	a	anyone who plays this game must like getting their male reproductive organs slammed in between a door for a living

10097	1	a	Not the best mmo on the net, but a great opportunity for apocaliptic-lovers.
7817	0	a	A horrible pay to win 3rd person shooter
785	1	a	APB has tons of ways to customize and you can choose between being an enforcer or a criminal.
3909	0	a	Unoptimized, full of bugs, pay2win weapons, community made of try hard teenagers.  Waste of your time. Don't play this game.
7710	0	a	Not that great.
10391	1	a	OK, it seems to me a lot of people have negative things to say about this game. I personally love this game, I cant stop playing. I think what happens a lot of the time is people start playing the game and dont realize just how immense this game is. They get like a whole 0.5% of the game played and dont understand it, and quit out of frustration. This game isnt the prettiest, and it does have its share of bugs. But, I expect games this immersive to have bugs, and I'm more about gameplay and less about graphics. If youre looking for a great MMORPG game this is it. The skill builds actually make sense, not like most games that give you the ability to max out all skills, this game makes you choose a specific build set to your play style. The crafting system is rich and really what i love about the game, Im always striving for better gear.   My advice. If you love crafting, skill building, tedious looting(i did say TEDIOUS) this is a great game. Play it. If you're not willing to atleast put 30-40 hours into the game before you make a decision on it, dont play it. This is a game for people of patience.  ALSO, for a free to play game, its still very possible to advance in the game and play it to the near fullest, unlike a lot of other free to play games.
7861	0	a	A run of the mill third person shooter disguised as a free roam gta style type game, the world is dead, theres nothing to do but objective based missions against other players the only thing this game has is its customization. Not to mention this game defines the meaning of pay to win.
9174	0	a	Boring, doesnt save correctly
5107	0	a	I rate it Meme out of cancer.
3313	1	a	Fast cars, Sweet guns, and money (that isn't yours) sounds amazing, but when you play the game, you get to live it.
9743	1	a	I can ride on a chicken. 10/10
1896	1	a	BEST GAME!
3090	1	a	GTA Online before it was cool.
13	1	a	Awesome game! Definitely worth your time!  I am a leader of a clan and i have 5 years of experience in this game. I make this review to proof to you that this game is worth your time.  1) I never payed for this game, i'm gold for 3-4 years in a row now (In the first year i had a very bad pc and internet connection which was the reason me being bad mostly). I use free to play guns, mostly N-Hvr (Given or Bought with game money) and i'm winning against 85-90% of the players who are using guns they bought in shops for real money. Its true that i had some struggling moments at the beginning, but it was all worth it. Don't forget that i started 5 years ago... They made it more simple for starters now. I also want to inform you that there are many opportunities to earn real money (G1C) to buy stuff (guns, kits, ...) in the armas market for doing events which are explained to you in the forums of this game.  2) The community in this game is awesome, i can't give it another word. In every game there will be som D**ks but that is inevitable, generally speaking, 8 to 10 of the people you will meet are very friendly.  Other good points i experienced in this game; -Updating the game on regular basis -Good graphics. -Detailed character/car design capabilities -Can make nice music themes / songs -VERY good player support  Some lesser points i experienced; -Some people out of your mission are preventing you from proceeding, keeping you from critical time (Happens rarely). -I myself do not have this problem, but some of my friends can't play the game cause of FPS lagg. -If your friend is silver and you are gold, it is highly possible you get 2 golden opponents matched against you (This is the only major problem in this game at this moment in my opinion). It is even possible that 3 golds are matched against 4 silvers. The 3 golds win easily cause they have more experience / team play. This is also the reason for the negative comments about people saying this game is p2w, which it isn't. The game itself is perfectly playable with f2p guns like i do. Its just the matching system which needs some more attention.  Hope this helped you :)  P4wn - Enforcer- 'Sharp' Leader - Patriot EU2
2977	1	a	Free game similar to GTA
8965	1	a	I played little of this game. But so far great game! I just wish it was more like dayz where you loot off the ground and in buildings and if you die in pvp you lose gear thats what i like but its still a good game.
5861	0	a	NON STOP RUNNING AND THE GAME WONT START
4160	0	a	pay 2 win  gets â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by golds first time playing  hackers and exploiters   â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community   10/10 would pay again
1621	1	a	Played APB off and on for a long time before i even had a steam account. The game is definantly worth playing. Why? To be honest, jsut gives you something to do. This game is designed to be played from time to time, or atleast it feels that way. Anyone who reviews this game as a game you paly every single day is doing it wrong. The game has some major issues. Has hackers, ect. The way to avoid this is to stay within bronze and silver threat level, no hacker is going to be bronze or silver, they will be gold. People who pay to win wont be bronze or silver, they will be gold. I let the Pay to win players, and the Hackers go at it, and enjoy some decent well matched game play with some bronze and silver threat level player that dont pay to win nor hack. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. If custimization, and fast paced game play is your style, this is the game for you. If you are strictly in to just killing people and happen to be some CoD fanboy, this probably isnt your style.
2275	1	a	I hit my friend with a car.   10/10
5265	0	a	Waste of my Time  Downloads it  Opens it  Clicks Play Opens Explorer 3 times Errors  Wont open  Re-downloades  Doesnt work   Waste of time
6920	0	a	I love this game, jk lmao it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbo m80. Enjoy getting killed by try harding â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that pride themselves on killing level one's. lagging servers and sliding butter cars, make this game a must have for the poor orphans at Christmas  1337/10 My nan loved it.
2634	1	a	APB is a great game, The gameplay is alot of fun. And I love the way you can design clothes, cars and symbols!
10568	1	a	FInally fixed and no longer completely pay to win.
4477	0	a	i tried it in my old pc and i think this game want your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money micro micro oh want a car you can get one for only 40 $ just 40$ for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing car
648	1	a	best game u will ever play
6778	0	a	Used to be a fun game, now it's just a laggy clunky pay2win piece of crap MoneyFirst uses to milk the players wallet.
6577	0	a	Terrible game, terrible devs and lately have been banning pepople for no reason while being full of hackers avoid like the plague
9099	0	a	This game is insanely bad, i downloaded it because the pictures on steam made it look fun and an open world mmo, it is the exact opposite. all of the missions have bugs in them. if you looking for a survival game go download dayz. because this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible. i wouldnt even waste my time downloading it if i were you
10500	1	a	Contrary to my experience, there seems to be a lot of people complaining about how this game is 'dead', that there are no players anymore and that you will be somehow unable to install it using Steam.  Pros- I have had no problems whatsoever be they technical or player-wise.  The game even runs smoothly on my sub-par PC. Game still looks good on absolute minimal settings. Addictive high-speed gameplay. Makes you feel like a badass speed demon. A variety of weapons and classes to unlock, suiting any play style. Projectile based weapons make every shot a gamble and you feel awesome when you land one.  Challenges-  Learning how judge where your projectiles will hit is extremely difficult. You have to be able to think fast. The enemy team is somehow always well-organized and skilled, while your own team is a just a bunch of scrubs. At first you will get frustrated, but keep playing and you'll get better.  Overall, I love this game. It's unique and ridiculously fun. Give it a shot!  
6878	0	a	It won't even open the game for me!
10148	1	a	Love this game, the RPG elements are outstanding. Having third AND first person in an RPG is so fun, being able to fight monsters and such with tons and tons of weapons, too being able to get mounts such as horses and even cars! I recommend this game to everyone looking for an RPG mixed with an FPS. Thanks for the great game!(;
1669	1	a	Fantasitc game, it's dead now though D;
2659	1	a	One of best Free-To-Play MMO out there! Definitly give it a try. Won't be a waste of your time!
7724	0	a	i could not even play as soon as i finished making my character it would not let me enter the world. Fix please i really wanna play.
4195	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
135	1	a	Thee Age of All thee Points, of Bulletin. In of Reloaded.  In the land of Memorium, there once was a game which in it's early state, had brought itself shame.  And of that game, it came to die. But, it was reborn, and yet problems did apply.  At first there was happiness among the lands, the people danced, and typed their commands.  The played, they fought, and had their fun,  until Armas, G1's wretch, released the next gun.  Of their box, in of horror, did they spill: The unholy OP weapons and cheapo's will.  Cowards, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, brawlers, looter's filled the population. The games proper, way, and interest came to cessation.  For years, did the land rot, did the people die out, and did demons rise. Until as of recently, the new DEV's of a new age, began their apprise.   We've seen there wrath, and their wrong.  But perhaps now is the age of improvement ...  so that APB can once again be strong.   
2858	1	a	After playing this game for over 120 hours, I've finally realised that it is just a ploy for money. Having said that, I should also bring to light my very many laughs and good times I've had with this game. With the 'missions' and pvp so frustrating, the only redeeming quality of this game is customization. Filled with infinite possibilities, the game is fun, however tiresome and rage inducing. I'll have to give it a 6.5/10
8218	0	a	this game is a masterpeice with the most in depth character creation options i have seen in an mmo.i only know this because of youtube videos,because this game doesnt work.
1524	1	a	1 of the words best game 
10418	0	a	Um no thanks, not my style of game, very standard mmo, fallout feels, gameplay sucked and way to many skill butttons for my liking.
1527	1	a	The clothing content of this game is doable, the cars are pretty cool especially the Jericho my favorite just putting it out there, and the guns here range from simple to skilled depending on your preferance. There are plenty of sales that goes on throughout the year so u have plenty of chances to buy your necessary guns and equipment to take down your opponent. Play more in groups more than solo gameplay to get a more greater experience playing this game. This game is not the best stress reliever. TAKE TIME OFF from playing this game as well for YOU WILL get mad on several occasions playing APB. THIS GAME IS FULL OF BLATANT HACKERS and bad mouth people. Not recommend to play for any age. Find another game to play
9859	0	a	Post apocaliptic??? Survival game??? WTF, It feels like an mmo, not a survival game. 10/10 ign
885	1	a	Second Life/GTA hybrid that allows you to be a cop too. Pay 2 be pretty not pay to win. EVERYTHING available in real money market is achievable in game, exception being aesthetic items (e.g. gun skins, clothing items, etc).  11/10 will fap moar  p.s. Waifus... waifus errywhere....
5283	0	a	The game is absolute trash. It's no fun. The only way it keeps players is making them addicted. And making them hope one day they'll get that engine update. You will expect most people that play this game have no friends which you always have to expect. The community is is just horrific and unexplainable. The custimization is to primitive and needs to be improved. The graphics are insanely outdated. The gameplay is repetitive. The weapons don't even make sense.   Don't play this game if you don't want to waste your life. I do not recommend this game at all. It might say I played for only 300 hours. But that was when I got steam. I've played this game for over four years and I regret all of it. There is better games out there. Just steal your mom's credit card and you will get games that have the best they can offer.
481	1	a	If you want to play a game like Grand Theft Auto V that is free, Play this awesome game!
5042	0	a	IF you love me you will love this game 
8015	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
526	1	a	so i downloaded this game for the first time ever and it just crashes on start up
1024	1	a	All Point Bulletins...  When this game came out and the servers opened, the game itself was annoying beyond limit : only two servers that were overpopulated almost all the time, letting you discover the joy of something called 'Lag' in 2010, but also an awful stability regarding which system you were running. If you had Windows XP SP3, everything was -relatively- fine ; if you had Windows Vista... well, you were already â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.  One year later, the game becomes Free-To-Play and is even available on Steam in some so-called 'Reloaded' version. After sixteen attempts at keeping the damn software running for more than ten minutes, I gave up : it still full of random memory troubles, especially if you run it with Windows Seven, two Nvidia Quadro 4000, a processor Intel i7 Extreme Edition and 10Gb of Crucial Ballistix RAM.  Like if it wasn't already bad, the game requires PunkBuster, the worst counter bot ever created on Earth. Moreover, the customisation part is ridiculously limited.
705	1	a	its sick
795	1	a	I adore the game! Yes it has its bugs and still will be developing throughout time, but its fairly fun for the free game it is. The character customizing and designing ideas is fabulous and the ideas of doing tasks for each boss is very interesting. I give this game 4 out of 5 Bazookas!
1613	1	a	I love how its like GTA
2429	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a classic setting - cops versus crooks. It is a very fast paced open world shooter. The game is very simple and fairly easy to learn, but like most things, hard to master. When you enter the game you create your charater. You have a lot of customization options. A lot. After that, you will expirience a lot of wierd moments, where you will not know what you are doing. But when you actually grasp the game logic, you will start to have a lot of fun, but again, it does tend to 'punish' those who lose missions. But, the gameplay isn't even close to why the game is so much fun. When you enter the social district, you get to costumize your charater at various kiosks around the map. You can costumize all from your charater, to their clothes and even their car. But then again, you do need to buy premium for further costumization (Premium costs around 15â¬). When you feel you know your way around the game, you will want to join a clan. Clans in this game don't add much meaning to the game, other than the name, and possibly a clan event here and there. But it is an amazing way to meet new people, to play with. Some clans even tend to have clan colours or even clan clothing. The game does lack weapon balancing (the armas gold weapons are a lot of times a lot better when being hold by a - so called pro) and it does (at times) have a big number of aimbot and wallhack hackers, which ruin the mood. The game servers aren't the best and you do need a good system to play it without fps lags. Also, the people in the game are a lot of times â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and can ruin your mood. Don't let them! The game is a lot of fun once you know what you are doing and the costumization is amazing - one of the best in mmo games. Overall, it is worth a shot.
7426	0	a	this game. issue after issue. so, first off. after opening it the 2nd time. the launcher was scanning. infinitely. for god knows what. after disabling IPv6 protocol, it worked. but when i tried to launch game. it did absolutely nothing. well, it opened chrome tab, 'like us on facebook to get 1 day free premium' (big whoop one god damn day..) after pressing launch AGAIN. it opened a splash screen. then opened another one. after leaving it like this for couple mins. nothing. so far, from my experience. this game. not worth 1 hr of downloading. (5GB from steam, then came with 500MB update from launcher, which only downloaded at 25-50% of my max download limit..)  (as i havent been able to play this game yet. dont take in consideration of my 'do you recomend this game' as u may not experience this issues like i have.)
8323	0	a	didn't work for me and looks really cool butt didn't work for me
6824	0	a	This game is sh*t. I'll play it.
2523	1	a	APB reloaded is fun shooter if you want to shoot people or just went to kill cars and if you are a law and order kind of guy then ok this is the game for you.
8809	0	a	First, I would like to say that this review is in no way influenced by the Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016  or.. maybe it is.
9469	1	a	Started to play because of the post-apocalypse feel. Stayed for the random flashmob dance :P
1435	1	a	fun with friends
4218	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
529	1	a	vey good for a free game its amazing
1942	1	a	Good game but I got kicked for getting 5 headshots in a row (?)  Nearly every player is a noob.
6710	0	a	This game is GREAT but ALOT of HACKERS
7921	0	a	so there i was, a criminal. an old man with gray hair, greased back, wearing a black business suit with black gloves (Iknowyouseemestylin), i just robbed a couple of stores in my big white windowless van, complete with the words 'free candy' sprayed on the sides, when i decided that i wanted to do some missions. so i hit the auto mission button and was thrust into one of those bring item A to area B missions. i get to the door i need to break open to get the item, when suddenly POP, i'm one shot buy a cop with a sniper rifle. i think nothing of it, and go on with my missioning, i start running back when i suddenly hear 'SHHVOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAA BOOOOOOOOOOOOM', i suddenly become tomato sauce and see the death cam, another cop! this one had a rocket launcher. now i'm starting to wonder, how did these 2 guys get such nice things, yet i only have a bloody starter machine gun and pistol. so the match ends (we lost completely), and i go to look for the weapons. none of the merchants I had access to had such nice boomsticks, then i noticed it, APB STORE. so i go onto the arma store and LO AND BEHOLD, Snipers and Rocket Launchers. a can buy PERMANANT guns from the apb store for real world cash. THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS RIGHT FOLKS, guns you buy ingame are 30 day guns, the permanant ones are either horrifically expensive, or cost irl cash (and are also expensive). who has 2 thumbs and won't be playing this game? nathan lane. I too will not play this game.
1516	1	a	Ok, very nice, but when i spend 1000$ for ammo, i can't use it!
5534	0	a	Cancer.
8272	0	a	People with premium weapons usually win this game. noobs get matched against experienced players constantly. Overall, not a very good f2p game
7027	0	a	San Paro...A city in peril with its streets overrun with gang violence, all at the feet of the Evil Corporation, 'Gamersfirst'. Will you escape the clutches of poverty and take what isn't yours? Or will you be the few and proud to standup to this chaos? Are you ready to take the fight to the streets? Well don't, stay at home and dont spend any money on this game, all it does is make the Jews at Gamersfirst more powerful....
7131	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game...they say : ' Apb Reloaded need at least 2gb of ram and 4 gb recomanded ' i gave 2 gb ram..and i can run it ... ok ... :/
3289	1	a	good game only issue is its pay to win
8562	0	a	  Its a fun game. But its pay to win. Which no one likes games like that.
6100	0	a	THIS IS PAY TO PLAY AND PAY TO WIN I GOT THIS WHEN IT FIRST COME OUT BEFORE IT WENT FREE TO PLAY WAS A GREAT IDEA BUT JUST POORLY EXECUTED
10366	0	a	I watched this game's download bar with great anticipation. Then I played it. And then I deleted it. After 15 minutes of playing. Seriously. The description states that Fallen Earth blends FPS and TPS into an awesome postapocalytpic RPG and stuff. The first preson mode is trippy to the point of being unusable, while the overall sensation you get while playing is, well, bad. Slighty burning in the gut. Go get S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout. Seriously.
8977	0	a	Fake Fallout online wannabe, Everyone has Bikes and Cars and you are stuck on a goddamm horse. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥, i'm out.
7641	0	a	every game I join boom an insults come out.
3347	1	a	This game is like chewing gum, you eat it, spit it out and never eat it again. ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)  10/10
3240	1	a	This game has come a long way since its early stages. I hope you guys give this MMO a shot cuz its pretty dang good and if you do look me up ill most definately be loggin in the hrs on this one!
9625	1	a	Great game! looks a lot like Fallout3 which I enjoyed playing. Though there are a few glitches as i started. great idea
8237	0	a	The biggest pay to win I've ever experienced... Â£24 for a CAR! 1 CAR!! Do not download this, it's simply not fun at all and the developers beg for money so much. Avoid at all costs!
1479	1	a	Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game. For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..   Bad things after the change: -Good palyers have become â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...) -The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..) -The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...) -The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year.. -Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..  Good thing i can still say: -One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart. -Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.  There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be. 
3695	1	a	Decent game, kind of pay to win but most weapons that you buy are just the same weapons you start with you have but reskinned. Lot's of customization and fun to play with friends and you can just absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ around.         9.5/10 kill more crims
5924	0	a	i bought 20$ worth of premium and then the next day this update happens now when i click start nothing happens!!! i want my game to work or i want my money back!
2808	1	a	its a pay to win game but play if you want to
415	1	a	gut game, i rate 5/7 p2w
7297	0	a	Used to be fun, it's simply a Money grabbing title now with hackers and 'wtf!?' moments every 5 minutes
4898	0	a	Matchmaking system is terrible, keep getting repeatedly matched against fully geared players despite being brand new. Game has its charms but loses those charms quickly after the 50th rocket-induced death animation. Excited to not play this game again until they sort this crap out.
5750	0	a	Great game. Corrupt company. Don't play it.
4077	0	a	this game is junk ..  peopele are hacking and skaming others .. you cant trade your weapons Or items you have to do it in the marked/AH  dont play it .. the owers of the game dont give a dunk abud the hackers or the peopele that skam others if you do send a email saying that this guy is hacking or you got skamed .. that dont care and will tell you that its a part of the game ..  you as a player can find other and better games out ther then this junk .. dont spend your time downloading it .. hallo kitty online is better then this :)  have a nice day
2015	1	a	This has to be one of the best free2play games that steam has to offer, that's if you have a thing for GTA style games. With the endless customization that involves cars, clothing, music themes, and so on.. this game gives you more possibilities than any other game that has been released.  Pros: Endless amount of customization choices Great Shooting style Easily adaptable for new players  Cons: Not a huge community[Still big enough to enjoy though] Game servers sometimes lag Hackers Griefers [ General multiplayer games have this though]  Driving system seems like it could be better than it is at the moment..  Rating : 8/10   If you're looking for a decent game to play you might as well give this a try and end up becoming addicted, like I have.
1098	1	a	Pretty good game idk why u guys are so mean like yea it crashes it makes you play more, i dont feel like it makes me play forever im not so good at designs but i like it!!! 9/10
6172	0	a	Its a pretty average game at best. Its just a gta ripoff with bad graphics poor driving mechanics buggy af takes too long to load. its pretty fun for the first 10 minutes but just gets repetitive and boring. overly complicated and just glitchy. if you want to try a free poorly made version of gta san andreas then this is the game for you
9387	0	a	Horrible, HORRRRRRRRRRIIIIIBBBBLLLLE.. I unistalled this garbage before the tutorial or whatever you want to call it was. Sounds are missing, enimies run around at mach 12, buggy trash. Do not waste presious time off your life to even attempt to play this.
9036	1	a	Rough around the edges, but I find that endearing. Solid RPG elements such as character progression, crafting, and skills, nice apocalyptic theme, and good support make this a very enjoyable free2play action RPG. You must give this a try, especially since it's free.
3955	0	a	a waste of time.
6358	0	a	When this game first released, it had promise, sadly for APB it died within 6 months of release, I still regard it as a massive flop.       Just a shame really.
2500	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs.
9419	0	a	This game is Terrible even for a free to play game. you have waaaaaaaay to many screens open while you play so u can never see where the ememies are you also are forced to switch weapons using Ctrl plus the moouse wheel witch only works about 20% of the time and on top of all of that if an enemy is chasing you theres no escaping, the can literaly hit you with a shank for like 12 feet away and i have to be at makeout distince to even hit him with my pistol, all together this is probably the worst game ive ever played in my life
692	1	a	Its quite interesting i must say!
10149	1	a	this game first was a good game with some brilliant concepts now it has matured into a fantastic game with a lot of deapth and good multiplay. A real classic for its type and free to play a must have in the goodies cupboard
5686	0	a	This is a game I wish I could love because who doesn't want to play Cops And Robbers: Online?  Sadly though, the game is absolutely broken by blatant, no apologies pay to win (which is a term I hear thrown around a lot but I have never found as relevant as with APB) policies, a pretty pronounced bias for the criminals, and flat-out meaningless 'matchmaking'.  Let me put it this way: after a one year hiatus, I came back and made a new character. As I was relearning the mechanics and how to play, I queued up for my first match and was pitted against a gold-ranked superhero who had a gun that killed me in two shots, a rocket launcher, and a machine gun for a secondary weapon. Only bother with this game if you have about a hundred bucks of disposable income that you want to spend on the in-game store.
1064	1	a	A free gta basically
9576	0	a	Actually this game is not in steam at all... you have to create a gamersfirst account and the updater trends to hijack your connection while updating, if you really like to play this don't download it here, go directly to gamersfirst and download the client manually
8424	0	a	this game is a virus it wont shut off!!! 
10492	1	a	Simply the best free to play game on the market.  Think Fallout vs Madmax and you are pretty near what the games is... but in my opinion it's got more Fallout to the flavour than Madmax, espeically when you see the Brotherhood of Steel clan running around RPing.  The world is huge, the quests are fun, and the crafting is 2nd to none. Crafting which is the benchmark of any MMO to date. Everything, well 99% of items are player made.  Play 1st person or 3rd person, live combat with head shots that have to be aimed and a full and exotic levelling of your character. Just a huge onion where layer upon layer you open.  But the emptyness of the world is so relaxing and cathatric, where hugh swathers of the map are exactly what a wasteland should be. NPC areas are rich of people and often where you'll see people and the live chat is still active for the endless questions for the game as it's depth is not reached just with the tutorial.  It's often it's depth which is so alluring, with the game systems opening up by discover and with the levelling being so statisfying, the only question you'll need to answer is do you have a free hour of your life to test out the game. As with free to play, what's there to loose, and what a discover of a forgotten game you'll find.  A rare gem in the grass, not quite a polished diamond, but nonetheless priceless in a market full of carbon copy fantasy MMOs, buy to win games and games that are instantanced.   Fallen earth is fully open world with no loading, and for that, mega props to the dev team. My hat goes off to you.
6481	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
4386	0	a	It's lame and it;s keep kicking me :[ P Please help ;[
2162	1	a	it is good game . I can say it is only game with have police mod on it but it is full of lag i have 1Gb internet but i have lag on it my system is not bad too   AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 260 Processor 3.2 GHz  RAM 4.00 GB ATI Radeon HD 5450 512mb win 7 pro
1323	1	a	It was alright when I played, I don't know if it's been updated to be actually worth the time/money. But overall, I have to recommend to at least try it.
653	1	a	good and fun game enjoy playing it
4570	0	a	I've had more enjoyment being on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ discord servers than playing this game.
4212	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
6142	0	a	It would not run well on my computer and constantly froze.
2021	1	a	Its a good gmehowever I think everyone wants helicopters, planes, shops and a controller option 
4420	0	a	Hackers, Kids with Mom's Credit Card, Pay to Win and Premium Galore. Bought the gamne when it cost' 60 bucks to buy, have the disc and love what was on it, but this game was turned into another marketing campaign using gamers as a form of profit.
9017	1	a	Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.  Warm Regards, MikeN
3734	1	a	Good game considering it's free. Fun if played with friends but solo is boring
6282	0	a	Moneyfirst.
4653	0	a	FULL OF HACKERS G1 PRETENDS IT ISNT DONT BELIEVE THEM
2370	1	a	This is a fun but also repetitive and dont play this game if you hate pay to wins
347	1	a	I couldn't wait to play this game, but once I downloaded it and installed it I would run it anndddddd It would freeze... I would ley it load.. And Load.... And load..... AND LOAD..... Still nothing.... It says I have about 72 hours on game but I think it glitched out something... Trying to reinstall it to see if it makes a difference. If it does I will change my review!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~EDIT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I finally got around to building a 64 bit machine, so! I found the game CAN Work properly with a couple of tweeks!  Pros: Very fun, good storyline, lots of things to do in the multiplayer, free. Cons: Lots of hackers online, Lag issues, Nothing else more... I really enjoy this game, now.
6607	0	a	Havent even play the game yet and theres already an error -_-
10611	1	a	Back in 2012 on my terrible laptop I spotted this game for download. I decided to jump on it at first and I LOVED it. It was fast paced, so many different play styles, a lot of maps for different playing styles. The classes are great, guns are great. Although the game did get abandoned so the developers could work on MOAB style games *cough* Smite *cough* I still enjoyed it. I'd recommend the game for those fast-paced run and gun lovers.
10024	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
9374	1	a	Game has changed a lot, but the old versions used to be really fun and immersive. It's a lot more modernized(microtransactions, pay2win), but is still enjoyable as it has a spark of what it used to be
7502	0	a	Full of hackers, and the dev team is lazy as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6329	0	a	 This game is a poor mans Saints Row; full of hackers and idiots online. Also a Pay-To-Win, so anyone who hacks/pays real money for guns has a total advantage over average players. Driving any vehicle is delayed by a fraction of a second so getting used to turning/steering is plain retar**d. The customization of vehicles is honestly one of the best I've ever seen in any game so that's ONLY what it's good for. If you're cheap then play it, otherwise don't be a cheap as*hole and buy Saints Row.  2/10
10651	1	a	Really fun game.
3503	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
957	1	a	APB is a game that has a big learning curve because it doesn't tell you what you are supposed to be doing at any given point. That said it is a game that I keep coming back to because I enjoy the movement and shooting mechanics, as well as the open world and seamless missions, and driving cars. This is not GTA: There are not a million cars. This game is about teamwork, shooting, running and parkour. It got these elements down, moreso than GTA. I think you can play this game without paying and have fun, however there are SOME advantages to buying equipment, I guess it's mostly aesthetic.  I wish other games would pull off what this game has done well, but they haven't yet. The movement, and physics are pretty good, much better than GTA5 garbage combat mechanics. Customization is unmatched ANYWHERE.  I love this game in spite of it's flaws. And I want a CAP40 sooooo bad!!
2799	1	a	APB is a very nice game but too bad I mean get stuck in the game I play 2-3 minutes and locks. Pretty please help me. Thanks
5600	0	a	Ah, I played this game on G1 till i got sick of it, why? Servers lagging, noobs hacking and unbalanced weapons beside P2W. Yeah it was a 3 years waste of my life.
5145	0	a	The idea behind this game is great; it's like GTA with a ton of customization for multiplayer.  Unfortunately, progression is painfully slow. After 53 hours of gameplay, the vast majority of which was spent in missions, I had enough money for a vehicle and 1 or 2 weapons that were only to last 10 days before disappearing. Also, I had barely unlocked any upgrades.   The matchmaking system is hard on newer players.  Here is a common matchmaking scenario:  Match 1: You're against newer players...either an easy win or it's pretty even  Match 2 (after winning match 1): You're against veteran players with dreamteam equipment or newer players that have dreamteam equipment thanks to the cash shop [either way, you're at a flat disadvantage]  After losing match 2, you return to match 1...and on and on     Regardless of your skill, you've gotta be willing to feed the game money or a whole lot of time if you want a fighting chance. Strategy only goes so far in this platform.  fun for only a short while
6846	0	a	100% AWFUL is what you will get when you play this game.... ARE YOU READY TO GET REKT CONSTANTLY BY PLAYERS WITH WEAPONS THAT FAR OUTCLASS ANY SORT OF SKILL? ARE YOU READY TO DO NOTHING BUT DIE AND DIE AND DIE WITH A REVOLUTIONARY MATCHMAKING SYSTEM THAT ONLY MATCHES YOU WITH PLAYERS FAR BEYOND YOUR SKILL AND GEAR SO THEY CAN R*PE YOU FOR EASY MONEY AND POINTS WHILE YOU RAGE AND TRY SO HARD TO DO SOMTHING, ANYTHING TO NOT HAVE YOU GAME EXPERIENCE TURN INTO A KEYBOARD SMASHING SIMULATOR? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!  I've tried for over 75hrs to enjoy this game and to no avail, people that have been playing this game longer than you will absolutely destroy you no matter what you do. The ONLY features that I had a fun/challenging time with was the custimization YES my Char looked so cool and so did my truck! but thats not what this F*CKING GAME IS ABOUT!!! so yeah, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone unless you are MLG sponsored or are a glutton for punishment or you wanna spend all your time customizing your char and car.
2665	1	a	OMG GET THIS GAME BE CRIMINAL AND DO STUFF! ITS SOOOOOO AWESOME
8605	0	a	If you want a spawn and get kiled simulator get this. if you would like to smash windows and steal the same car to get the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ youve stolen to sell over and over again get this. if you want the worst possible community in the world get this game.  This game is like cancer had a baby with hitler then hitlers cancer baby â¥â¥â¥â¥ed stalin  it would be more beneficial to drink bleach you would have a far better experience.   Real review: i played this game for 28 hours, The only time i had fun was the clothing and cars. but after about 11 hours the game got so repetetive all you did was smash windows to get some items put them in your car then drive to some place miles away to sell them. the misions seemed somewhat uninspired it was either kill these people or get this thing to that place. Then the market oooooh the market...you had to smash windows do missions and sell sperm or organs just to buy anyhting off the market now some things are of reasonable price but everything else is just so damn overpriced it cost millions no billions to buy a single gun or car. altogether 28 hours was more than enough to know that i love to hate this game.
58	1	a	Great game idea but gamersfirst doesnt care that much about the players, they should be called gamerslast moneyfirst but still like the gameplay!

7097	0	a	This game is a pay to play type of game, when it first came out before I had steam the game was fun. But now its disappointing to say the least. I am sure if you had plenty of spare money to just throw at the game then it would be fun again. Not to mention, that people are rude. Even people who are 'supposed to team with you' they will do whatever it takes just to mess up the game or mission' needless to say... I dislike it. It is free however. Definitely wouldnt waste hard earned cash on it though.
3135	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME!! I love everything about this game! I play it with my bro all the time and we are obssesed. I totally recommend this game. The only bad things about this game is 1. Mine takes SSOO long to open and play APB, but this isn't their fault, my computer just isn't very good. 2. Everything in the store on the Social District is so expensive! Again, not their fault. Players just sell items in the game for ridiculous amount of money xD
7750	0	a	Well, after playing this game for a short amount of time, and I know you will say you haven't played that long, but it is very poorly put together, and not enough time was put into missions. They get extremely boring and it is very difficult to gain money. The money isn't the issue though, it's the ranking system. It does take some time to get used to, and it is not confusing, although it is time consuming. The marketing is not well put together as well. Very inconvinient. The driving mechanics as well as the shooting mechanics aren't the greatest either. Driving is very delayed when you want to turn, and shooting is very inaccurate due to large crosshairs, even when you aim in. All and all, I'd give this game a 6/10, mainly because of the graphics being so good for a free to play game and the idea. GamersFirst definetly have something started. They just need to finish it..
2116	1	a	I played in the Original BETA with RealTime Worlds. This version KICKS MORE ASSSS!!! Play it. Come onto Server: Patriots EU2
10615	1	a	Fast Paced First or Third Person Shooter With the speed of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing plane + the fact that its a free game how can you say NO to this epic Freet to play but not pay to win game?! Support the game that first came out with Capture the flag! :D

5557	0	a	:D i think it's better to don't talk about this game
5031	0	a	It's free, it's fun, and it got loads of customizations!  But sadly, the community is horrible, filled with trashtalkers and hackers.  It also get boring fast due to lack of game modes with PVP system only.  I wouldn't recommend this game lest you're the type of a gamer who's competitive or masochistic.
8007	0	a	Bored to tears, that's what.
9478	1	a	quick fun... I recommend it if you are looking for an ONLINE version of FALLOUT. I am surprised that BETHESDA hasn't come out with an all online game version of the storyline FO (Fallout Online)...lol...But this will fill in the void for now if that is what you are looking for.

4826	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I've ever played, and wasted money on, you have pistols that can out damage assault rifles and sniper rifles and if you want a good weapon you got to buy it with real money the ingame weapons they give you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this game has a lot of hackers. I can unload in a person with a good rifle and they won't die they hit me 3 times with a smaller gun or pistol I die. This game could be a lot better if it was balanced better and took better care of hackers. I play a lot of game and I'm fine with not being the best and dying now and then but come on, I even see people on the chat in game say how they are just gonna quit the game. I liked the game untill I kept running into the bs in the gameplay.
6452	0	a	Micro transactions, toxic community, hackers, bad matchmaking, horrible gameplay, and $30 for a permanent secondary? what's not to like?     God this game could be so much better if the devs weren't 100% focussed on microtransactions. And if it didn't have a toxic community, and didn't have a disgusting engine.
2846	1	a	game is pretty cool
9597	1	a	if you can handle the PS2 era graphics and the odd lack of people, you will probibly enjoy this Fallout MMO. its definitly a better RPG then fallout 4 is .

1544	1	a	ITS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED
8409	0	a	Oh this game had potential...  After several times of trying to play this, I've come to the conclusion that this game, along with the devs, are just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The game is a joke of what it USED TO BE, and even then it was a joke of what it could be! Yeah you can customize, if you could actually play it and win missions. Yeah it looks good, but that's because it was filmed with godmode turned on and an aimbot used. The controls: Pathetic. To drive, your either accelerating, or idling. Turning a car is like trying to ride a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ without paying her. If you want some piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play, come play this! If you want a game that is cops v robbers, go play GTA, if you want customization, go play Sims or SPORE, but please for the love of the gods, leave this game where it is: In digital hell.
4172	0	a	This game use to be awesome during the open beta. Now its full of cheaters and Pay to Win items that makes Free Players almost impossible to win. I feel sorry for anyone that continues playing this game since your wasting time and possibly money. Yeah the game has its moments like the customization of cars, clothing and players. The engine is Unreal 3 and it runs O.K. but it still lags and freezes with the occasional FPS drops that come out of no where. I'm just dissappointed in a very shady business model of a game that resembles GTA.
4139	0	a	The gameplay isn't bad... if it wasn't for the fact that this is a micotransaction filled game. All the guns have that 'buy it and own it for 9 days' kind of thing, which is annoying as hell.   I also can never seem to find other players to actually play matches with. Are people just not playing this or is the system just broken?   Has potential but just kinda sucks.
5764	0	a	I have played a long while without steam since close Beta, all G1 gamers are friendly and F2P.   Till 2013, P2W became hot topic in this game and i totally AGREE those people who invest a lot of MONEY in this game can have HIGH CHANCE TO WIN,  That trigged gamers (most of them are UNMATURE KIDS) tried to use with HACK PROGRAMMES for tricking G1 points and gaming that happened on 3 servers(EU, NA, HK). [Check youtube please, Gamerfirst]  The threat system became a joke for me. FAKE GOLD, HACKER CLAN.  I believe people will change, and game as well,  but it have become worst than what gamers should EXPERIENCE( ENJOYMENT, EXCITMENT and TEAMWORK).  Im sick of the communty with hackers and team killers.  Please someone help this game.

1612	1	a	I'm confused, I can't get think is this a game, I thought more as a joke, even the years past playing it, i lost a lot of time, but really i did? But hey, this is really cute. I think it approaches as an astral mystical experience, and i don't think it's only me.  PS: This game will have a higher chance of get your brain f***ed hard, so, be aware.

6722	0	a	APB~  + Decent graphics   Customization  Open world  Impound   ~ Guns and vehicles (the cheaper set) are rented for a few days    - Matchmaking is unbalanced most of the time  Missions are repeatitive and some are unfair  Buying powerful guns with real money  Hvt when doing great (I forgot what this is called. Wanted/Heat level?)  Too much shooting   *Note: I never used real money to purchase anything.*  This was a fun game when I fisrt started playing it. Being able to customize my character to whatever I wanted and having almost the same for the car was nice also. The graphics were OK, and the amount of guns, clothing, and veheicles to choose from was moderate.   Gameplay itself was decent. It was fun exploring the area and going after the criminals and getting paid for it. Most missions were fun to do and most of the time I did have a good team. After awhile however, the missions dd tend get repetative. Especially if the player is solo and searching for a mission/group. Many times I had gone with a team of 4 against a team of 2. Other times it was an equal match but the player levels were unbalanced. Whether or not I failed, the same mission would usually pop up after the next or right after that. Also, it's awesome when a player is doing great on a mission then all of a sudden becomes a High Value Target and everyone is alerted to that HVT. Now, that player that was doing great has around 20 players hunting their â¥â¥â¥ for a bounty. Usually they were killed within 15 seconds.  I'm honestly a bit mixed on the gun/car lasting only a few days. Guns I can understand, even the paid ones to *try* and balance the game. But I hated paying a lot for a car that would be gone in a few days. It would take awhile to get enough money to ..I guess one could say to 'rent' a vehicle since payment was little and I started to be matched against higher levels. The money I was saving then had to be used for a better weapon if I wanted even a chance at killing some. Even the default gun players receive at the start is fairly balanced. I've killed many with it. But it doesn't compare to a sniper rifle that is a one hit kill.   Most players kept to their self. Others were chatting on the global chat which was mostly friendly. The rest were of course people trolling. I only had trouble with a few and the rare person that laged like hell. (or hacked)  What I played was fun...  ...Till I was killed 22 times trying to get to a mission objective and being blown up by someone on the opposing team with a RPG. No matter where my team and I went, there was always somebody waiting in a corner, or at the objective. I did get to run over the person once though! Why stay for 22 deaths? I don't like to rage quit.   Since then I would drive around waiting to see some action pass by. Then when a group went by I would follow them to the objective then take the cars they stole from the civies and impound them for cash. Which was pretty good if they stole a high performance veheicle. Especially armored trucks. Oh, and the vehicle wasn't damaged too bad.  - I can't say I fully enjoyed the game since I died *alot* from people who used real currency to purchase their guns. However, because of that, I can't fully recommend the game. I could over look the matchmaking (since CoD did that alot to me) and the missions. But it doesn't work in the end. Think this qualifies as a 'Great concept, poor execution' kind of game for me.  
4544	0	a	One of, if not, the most unbalanced POS I've ever played 1/10.  Would not recommend. Not even worth writing a full review about.
1575	1	a	i love the customization in the game 
7992	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
2112	1	a	Fun if you have people to play with :P
5030	0	a	The only reason i got this was because i didn't bother to spend any money and want to practice driving for my driving test because i thought it would give me some level of experience.           I failed the test
1307	1	a	I bet Its a good game just my computer cant handle it
3828	0	a	Got 37.0 hrs by being stuck in a loading screen 10/10 would loading screen again
7359	0	a	i was playing a hour early and i went to get food i come back on and it sayed i was banned for no reason i did nothing to get this no hack not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ player off so how do i get banned for nothing and it is now one hour later gamerfirst i will not get any more of your games
6757	0	a	I played this game for a very short time, but i can say for sure certain its a waste of time, the bugs are horrible graphics are glitched and things can appear blurred on high spec machines the gameplay between the two factions is also disgracefully unbalanced. its more P2W not F2P.
4191	0	a	Extremely laggy, and is not recommended for weak computers.
2894	1	a	awesome third person shooter epic
4640	0	a	Nice to see it's still broken as hell after 2 years.
6121	0	a	Didn't even work, and wants me to 'Like' their face-book page. I'm sorry that it might a good game and i am giving it a bad review, but it just doesnt work for me, Dont let this stop you from getting it though!
2296	1	a	I do not recomend player who play APB on laptop! If you not ok with 5-10FPS and have the worst lag ever. I had play 1000h on laptop and since I update to a stationary PC I never had a single lag never a froze not even today. Buuuuuuuuuut its a ok game 6.5/10 :)
2815	1	a	Despite APB's insane customisation options it's hampered by a too small a gameworld to play around in and repetitive missions. Hopefully future updates will rectify these issues, but until then this game is just 'OK'.
6728	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
4217	0	a	If you like hackers, then this is the game for you!
4616	0	a	Wow, ok. So apparently they made this free to play. So, long ago I had actually BOUGHT this game and up until about 2014 I had it in my steam library, because it was a purchase. Well, I go to play some today (2016) and find that it was removed from my account, either because they 're-released' it, or because they voided my purchase. Anyway, I go to download it and notice that it isn't 'free to play' but actually 'free to pay' NINETY-NINE F'ING DOLLARS FOR DLC?! THIRTY DOLLARS? The developers also don't know how to do DLC because they have the same DLC pack for both $29 and...free....So, let me see, you delete the game (which I paid for), didn't issue me a refund, and now expect people to pay $139 for your DLC which adds basic game functionality to it? Oh, yeah, they also have a habit of deleting your accounts due to 'database malfunctions'. (see 2011) HA! No way I would recomend this. This was a dead game back in 2011 and now, under the tyranical control of the new 'developers' (must be french for check cashers), has become not only a joke but a steaming pile of feces.
2144	1	a	its a fun free game like gta with way more customization allowed i recomebd this game to all who like shooters
5906	0	a	This is a game where cash is king, and not in game cash, I mean real cash, I dont want to spend big bucks for better weaponry and cars, this game would be good if it wasnt this way and the dlc was less pricey more guns were available ingame,same with cars, and a easy to understand tutorial too
10193	1	a	If you are a fallout 3 or fallout new vegas fan then this is your game. If you played the ps3 version or any of the early releases of it you know what to expect.   It's a great game with great idea's a cool leveling system and a wide open world.  The community is generally pretty helpful and the beggining few levels give a lot to the new players to get going,  It's got a decent learing curve for leveling since it's not your typical level system, but overall i think it's good.  Aside from all that, it's glitchy as heck. first person view is good but glitchy and i mean glitchy! Combat lags, and glitches, and the overall world is glitchy meaning you will get stuck at somepoint. But the developers must have known this and gave you a skill to kill yourself to respawn at a nearby lifepod.  overall i would say this game is worth a go, and if you sub it's definitly better. but you can do alright without paying.  I would say overall i it get's a 6/10. needs work but worth a try.
2337	1	a	its cool
9323	1	a	Its k
3555	1	a	First of all I'd like to clear up that G1 as developers are somewhat incompetent only seemingly wanting cash and money from players. So I will put a disclaimer that this review is leaning more into the aspects of the game or the game overall rather than the developers of the game and the decisions made by the company itself.  Now that I've invested quite the time with the game and as the time Im revising this review I have played for about 300+ hours of this game. I feel as if I was a bit too harsh and judgemental about my previous review of this game as I was critisizing the game way too harshly and was a bit biased due to my first experiences with the game.  Having invested a great amount of time into this game I have found that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was. The community is active in forums and are fun to socialize and interact with on most cases. Im not gonna lie that there are times when a player or two engages in the activity I like to call 'Who can be the best assh*le' in the game but they're only occasionally seen.  My best tip at this point would be to learn about the game in order to progress as APB Reloaded is a game that not only rewards you if you learn about secret routes or special hiding places for cover but also helps you progress through the game due to the help of the community itself.  I will admit though that before sinking 300+ hours into this game I painted a very biased opinion about the community making remarks that its cancer and toxic. Having personally interacted with the community in order to learn from veterans of the game and learning about tips and receiving advice from fellow players I then came to learn that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was.  Yes, the players online are very different from the ones in the forums and I can assure new players that it is not a turn off. The blend is quite well and sometimes even a good pair up. I will say though that if you dont have the patience to get better and invest some time into learning how things work with this game you'll end up having a very frustrating time blaming everyone else or everything else in the game rather than your lack of knowledge of it.  I whole heartedly feel that APB Reloaded is a game that I can recommend now, The graphics may be a little bit dated but that doesnt mean the game isnt enjoyable or playable. The community is helpful and fun to interact with and even though you get the occasional trolls you shouldnt get turned off by them since they are rare encounters. I would also like to state that there are barely any hackers in-game and I think people are mislead about the topic.  APB Reloaded is a moderately unforgiving game. Yes, I will say that it can seem unfair due to other players having upper hand due to the pay 2 win aspect but that has NEVER stopped me before. I have a character in Jericho server which had never seen any money invested to it and is now a Rank 100 Silver threat character with no premium and no overpowered guns at my disposal. The renting system is quite helpful since renting out guns that suit your playstyle can help you compete with various other players that does have premium guns and have invested money.   I also want to say that people think players are hacking but in all honesty those are the results of body modification implemented in the game. Just like in a MMO RPG, APB Reloaded has a system to benefit those who work on unlocking buffs for their characters. For instance there is a series of mods called Kevlar Implants and Clotting Agent. Both are health based modification used by many experienced players that give them an advantage over people. This isnt even part of the premium pay 2 win aspect as the body modifications I just mentioned are available to EVERYONE. Working up the ladder of whichever faction you chose to go with does reward you by unlocking these body modifications. Not only that but you can even get modification to give your guns more edge. BUT WAIT! it doesnt stop there! you can even put modification on your vehicles to suit how you drive and play! Of course you can customize your character but you can also implement skins on guns and even customize your vehicles!  Not only that but you never have to invest anything in the game as there is a system that lets you buy premium guns in exchange for in game currency earned through events such as Fight Club. This system is called the Joker Ticket system which lets players who dont have cash to invest in the game or just dont want to invest money to have an alternative way to get permanent items such as weapons, clothing, and even special vehicles and kits in a FREE way. Completeing objectives to save up Joker Tickets is a great alternative for those who want to play the game but not invest any money into it.  Take it from me who literally has a character that was built without the help of premium or OP guns. Just pure work put into the character and getting good in the game overall. As I said multiple times in this review, the key to APB Reloaded is to master the maps and to learn more about how things work in order to get better in the game.  Anwyays Ive been typing long enough so I will say this before I end this review. APB Reloaded is not a bad game at all. The learning curve is somewhat difficult and may take time to get used to. However, with the help of the community and fellow players you can get better at the game and advance. Try the game out and sink some time into learning how to play better and trust me it will be a great pass time if not a great game to enjoy overall.  Thanks For Reading!  -AgitoSempai (Jericho Server)  PS - Feel free to say hi :D
1996	1	a	Too.... much..... time....... wasted....... *dies*
7268	0	a	Ignore the Mostly Positive sign.  Even Uninstall doesn't work properly. 
10136	1	a	I'm not quite endgame yet, but I'm definitely far enough in to offer an informed opinion. I HIGHLY recommend Fallen Earth for the compelling stories (even the side quests are pretty captivating at times), advanced crafting, and outstanding player base. Since you've heard rants already, I'll clear up things I feel the other comments got wrong instead:  - This is a post-apocolyptic RPG, but beyond that it has little in common with Fallout. The crafting in Fallen Earth is much more advanced and takes longer (days, sometimes). The V.A.T.S. combat system we know and love from Fallout is not used. Most importantly, the actual story is completely different. So if you want F2P Online Fallout, you're going to miss the mark a little.  - It is nearly impossible to 'accidentally wander into' a PVP zone. You will be warned if you approach one and the map marks it with a glaring red zone. In the off chance you're blind enough to wander into one, players above that zone's max level are excruciatingly penalized for being there. So don't worry, you aren'y likely to be killed by another player until you're ready.  - Admittedly, the game is hard to get used to without a guide. There's no sugar-coating it. You know what they say about learning to ride a bicycle, though.  - Finally, while this is just my personal opinion, I think it's hard to consider crafting a hassle when you can literally keep playing while you craft. That engine your building will continue its construction while you shoot blight wolves and collect scraps.   Enough from me, download and try it. I certainly didn't regret doing so. 9/10
4028	0	a	APB reloaded does not start the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, DON'T get it
813	1	a	I took out 3 snipers using bricks 11/10   (Also IF you see a reveiw saying this game is P2W its really not if u have the skill u can deystroy ANY weapon u find in the Armas Market i would say this game is more like P2C=Pay to Convience which bascially means ur able to get bttr modded weapons quicker BUT i will say there WAS one p2w gun that they NERFED which was the Vas r2 Troublemaker which so OP that it could out gun a sniper at long ranges Sometimes)

4887	0	a	i can play this game 
878	1	a	Best third person game
4792	0	a	I have been playing the original APB Beta and the final product and i have to say the game got worse.   - You cant permanently purchase weapons. You are only able to buy them for 10 days each which honestly does my head in. This punishes every player who is not willing or able to sink in 3-4 hours daily.   - The social district is way to confusing. Back in the days of the original APB there where those Customisations stands all over the place, you literally could not miss them because there was at least one of each kind in every building. Now there are one of each in the whole drisrict and finding them is a paine in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ because there are no markers or directions.  - Matchmaking is nonexisting. I had to play against several groups of R200+ players who all where equipped with premium gear whhile i myself have been R20 and my teammates even where lower on level. What is the point of this? Nobody can tell.  - The same lag issues that where in the Beta of APB are still present in APB: Reloaded. The best example is how unresponsive the vehicles are. You litterally have to turn a second early because the car takes about a second to recognise your input even on a server that displays to have a 60ish ping.  I could go on and on about how badly executed APB: Reloaded is. But let me put all that into a single sentance. The game is worse than the Official Beta of APB has been and the beta ended about 4 years ago.  Dont waste your time on it and mor important dont waste any money on it.
3366	1	a	Really recommended game it has everything
1530	1	a	Fun game, although you can get pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sometimes.
7371	0	a	This game was with unique idea, super good customization and etc it was perfect, but then, like it always happens - cheaters and hackers come. The game is ruined now.
5748	0	a	This game is full of tricks to steal your money. They have the least balanced game I've ever seen. The game is far from realistic taking way to many shots to kill, and having way to much muzzle rise. If you're after a not so serious game, this might be fun with some friends if you're just driving your vehicles around like crazy, but it gets old fast. This game pretty much sucks all around...
8760	0	a	CMON devs can u not be a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bag and actually fix the god damn game cuz srsly its addictive but rlly not fixed
8365	0	a	The game is so ugly!! How to hack my pc can't get on low damn 30 fps! That FPS drops and lagg!!  To start the game! That is during like 88 hour!! Pay To Play game!!! A lot of bullcrap!! Why are there womans in the game!!! Everybody knows they are smaller en harder to hit in fights!! Cutscnene's, crap!! Loadings screen also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ie girls! People thinking I am watching porn...
2338	1	a	is so epic game try to play that so epic!
10013	0	a	The only thing that matters in a game is 'is it fun to play' ans the simple anwser is no; I cannot recomend a game that is as dull as this. The concept is great, the execution is not.
12	1	a	While this game does have its up and downs, probably the best part of this game is the customisation that can be achieved with the ingame editors, from recreating a certain song into a 5 second theme to making anime in the symbol editor. While the user generated content is amazing, the game does have a lot of downsides.  First off lets go with the matchmaking system, first off, districts are broken down into threat levels, green being worst and gold being the best. The main issue with this is that the matchmaking is based on the threat level and doesn't take your rep level into consideration, which is actually the level you need to increase to be able to unlock and access better gear so in many cases during my playtime, I being a low leveled player have faced the hell fury of 200 plus repped golds using osmaw's and grenade launchers on people who are still fairly new to the game.  Another issue is certain cash shop guns, while none of them are that dramatically overpowered to be considered litterally pay2win (Like there's no sniper rifle that can kill someone at full health in one shot). Most of them will give an advantage over other players, such as a joker cr5 thats moddable from when you start playing to buying pre-made guns such as a whisper, although the beginning weapon known as a STAR by the community, was actually buffed or tweaked to make it not so useless.  Now lets move on to bugs, like most f2p titles, a lot of bugs don't really get fixed until way later on in time, there are a few exploits in this game that allow players to get certain objectives stuck behind walls (This is common with capture the flag objectives) to players attempting to get out of the map (Mainly only in fight club). While those are exploits that players could abuse if they discovered them. There are also some bugs that will screw over your play experiance, such as random disconnects and crashes.  I also do not recommend playing APB if you have less than 8GB RAM on your computer, this game loves to eat up memory, my guess is that APB reloaded loves to store texture memory within the RAM in order to allow fast loading, to be honest I doubt i'm right, but its my only guess as to why it'd hog up so much resources.  And next off is the servers, laggy and litterally unstable, from horrible lag spikes when a district is full to litterally dropping client connections for no bloody reason what so ever, which is the main reason preventing me from playing the game propperly. Ontop of that is the slow and small patches applied to the game each week, while its good to finally see the game getting updates that were needed 6 months ago, this new movement by the devs to switch the games engine to a newer version of unreal 3 feels too late as the playerbase continues to decrease in size.  But I also forgot, punkpuster is litterally the worst anti-hack program I have ever seen, its just as bad as all those third-party or first-party anti-cheat rootkits most other MMOs force install onto your computer, it litterally doesn't do anything to stop hackers, the game has some pretty known active cheaters roaming around. Although personally imo, any anti-cheat tool that waits before banning doesn't work with any F2P title since these guys can just make new accounts every single time.  Overall I feel APB reloaded does have the capability to be something amazing, I am willing to support the game aslong as the improvements continue, I just wish it was more than just 1 ltitle fix or one tweak every week, I also wish the servers wouldn't dc me constantly and I also wish new clothes packs didn't cost 40-50 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars.
420	1	a	Apb Reloaded can be very similar to the drug industry. The product is addictive, it will ruin your life, drain your money and the makers/developers don't give a rats â¥â¥â¥ about you.
5090	0	a	This game used to be alright. Had a laugh playing with my friends after being new to Steam, only resorting to free-to-play games. Tried coming back to this after being bored and see what has changed, and well it is just utter wank. Too many problems to even be called a game anymore.   I'd rather watch myself get eaten alive by a rhinoceros which is getting it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ed out of it by the largest sperm whale on the planet, because this game is just that awful.   If you don't have any money or you're a cheap â¥â¥â¥ who don't like paying for games but want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ about with your friends, then I kind of recommened this game. But if you got the money to buy any game, literally anything else, then dont even waste your time with installing this â¥â¥â¥â¥. The best part about this for me would be uninstalling this â¥â¥â¥â¥tard of what you call a game off my system saving me the storage space with something remotely more playable.
5061	0	a	Used to love this game. But the hackers now make the game unplayable.
3270	1	a	God game just add anti cheat and perfect game for now its 8/10
9871	1	a	Eh its ok
4053	0	a	if you even THINK about getting this i will find you
8974	0	a	1. Wait until game loads.  2. Wait until game loads all the endless updates.  3. Get in game.  4. Run around in tutorial and remove needed stuff by accident before trying to figure out how to get it back.  5. Meet partner in game, only one area available for joining so obviously go there.  6. Get in area, get attacked in first five seconds. Proceed to running around for a bit to explore after getting shot.  7. Realize there is nothing to explore and ride off to the sunset with Cletus just to never return.  Full points, would loot again.

10542	1	a	Very fun fast combat game i love it and i do recommend it! :)
4745	0	a	This game sucks more â¥â¥â¥â¥ than a two cent â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. You go against people who are 10X your level, pay2win everywhere you look, and worst of all, the company reminds you of modern Blizzard (Which sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥) Don't bother playing this game if you don't have money to spare, because it's either be scammed and buy weapons, or lose and waste space.

4934	0	a	Let me first start off by saying that, since RTW went bankrupt, This game has been going further and further down hill every since it was turned into 'Reloaded'.  The game as it is now, is a disaster. Although it's a free to play game, there is probably 80% of the population that are cheating, It's a typical G1 Game and i wouldn't recommend it, even though it's F2P. I've played this game since it was in Closed Beta with RTW, and if it had of stayed dead after RTW, it atleast would of been a good memory.  Gameplay - 3/10 - It used to be much better, but now it's horrible.  Community - 2/10 - 80% of the players if not more, are cheating, and will try to grief/troll you because they think they are good.  Development - 1/10 - G1 Do not know what the word Development is, The game has pretty much everything RTW had, and whatever RTW Didn't have out already, G1 Just used the ideas RTW were going to implement and released that as their own work. The only thing that gets updated on a regular basis is the Cash shop.  Anti Cheat - 1/10 - The anti cheat is a joke, and it's even got to the point where some blatant cheaters that were caught and banned, have been unbanned via the GM's/Devs of the game because they 'know' them.  Overall Score - 1.75/10 is the average of all those scores put together, However i am actually givine it an  Overall score of - 0/10 - Because i think it should of just stayed dead and remained a good memory rather than it being torn to shreds with G1.  Recommendation - Although it's a F2P game i would stronlgy recommend you DO NOT try this game, If you want to, then do it, afterall it is F2P. But don't say i didn't warn you.
4300	0	a	Good game, requires alot of skill. Alot of cheaters in game.
2146	1	a	Its a great game. good things are that you can, edit your caracter 99% the way you want if you know how to and have the time, editing cars is a great thing when you dont rage YOU will, it goes on and on now bad things, No motorbikes please bring it to the game pls, if you dont have a friend too play whit you will be bored easly, the rage that you can get in this game is SO big, Its a pay to win game almost      Sorry for bad english BYE GONNA MISS YOU :(
1602	1	a	i have only played 5 minutes even though it sais i have played 20 hours or something and it was ffunn even though i had no clue what i was meant to do and i cannot play it again it has crashed

8110	0	a	Laggy, kicks you off of your server up to 15 times an hour, waste of space unless you have a VERY fast computer.
9426	1	a	this game is nice when textures are rightt 
4221	0	a	The Pay 2 Win is Real in this one.
5173	0	a	This game just will not behave. I made an account before I downlaoded it, launched it and logged on useing the account I made. Then it said it was invalid, so I made another account, and THAT did not work, then a third, and months later I downloaded it again, useing all three acounts to login with, and all of them were invalid. It is still like that, and I did not get an email for my roblem yet when I sent in a report, so I do not reccomend this game...
8131	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
2343	1	a	I love it. But not when people are 'Hacking' It just gets annoying when they kill you some how.. But other than that good game
7057	0	a	the game says p2w guns aren't more powerful then f2p guns (well lets see) p2w side one shot dead half a map away dead cars driving at 900 mph dead f2p side stand at somone shooting them multiple times he has same weapon we empty our clips me barley killing him car drives at 2 mph car blows up from two crashes then im ran over then one shot by a pay to winner have tactical adventage shot him 4 times he turns around casuly killing me  yea defintly f2p here guys 0/10
8899	1	a	a decent game but as i have seen pointed out it lacks imagination in some of the enemies and the bosses just soak up bullets but overall its a decent game about like runescape but again not the same you will just have to check it out  things it has that make it worth the time  - player built vehicals - factions (player controlled and non) - pvp and pve  - decent respawn system that will make you work to get your stuff back but wont make it easy mode - interesting selection of weapons   thats the highlights feel free to try it out its a free game aside from some in game things but thats how the gaame keeps running so overall its a decent game but fun if you like FPS games

5386	0	a	I used to love this game. It was a 'cheap' GTAV. I was thrilled, I could play a game just like GTAV for free!  It's never that simple.  I spent around 200 dollars on in-game items. It would of been cheaper just to buy GTAV.  There's a reason 'hacking' is a popular tag for this game. Also, there's some odd obsession with naked anime girls here. Not that that's a bad thing.
9631	0	a	its an alright game but i didnt get what i expected
856	1	a	As many people have already said, the game is pretty much P2W, but ignoring that fact the game is great. The characters and vehicles are more customisable than a Subway sandwich, and if you grab 2 or 3 friends the game is infinitely better and more fun. Granted, some people may have trouble running the game for issues that they blame on the game, and hell the issues might actually be because of the game, but if you can run the game smoothly, you have some friends to play with, and you encounter few P2Ws then the game will be great. Sometimes you have to ignore the cons and focus on how awesome the pros are to properly enjoy a game.
6565	0	a	wont let me play it because of an error
3443	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
7951	0	a	I never got to try the game because it never would respond when it was in the middle of starting.

693	1	a	[8/10] Nice action shootem up online game
10382	0	a	The only part of this game that met my expectations was the uninstall button. I didn't think all of the negative reviews could possibly be true, considering how cool the ideas sounded on paper. And then I played it. Every facet of this game could've been accomplished better in a few weeks by any other studio. I, with no experience, could've designed a better looking UI. The gunplay is utterly terrible. The graphics are severly outdated, even by 2011's standards. The community is hostile. I didn't even get far enough in to mess with the customizable vehicles. Do yourself a favor and just get Borderlands instead.
7151	0	a	Hackers game players that have money to spent on the 0/0 rating game yeah why is the trash even on steam they need to remove it and get soming els on here (STEAM APB Reloaded) click Delet problem solved
5658	0	a	This game... If its not the unbalanced matchmaking that gets u annoyed in this game its the hackers or the 12 year old children who use their moms credit card to buy a bazooka and the fastest car in the game to make other peoples gameplay a living hell. Game has a great concept but thats as far as it gets. Developers are just too greedy trying to satisfy their own needs than actually balancing â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game.
8455	0	a	couldn't even play the game becasue it would never recognize my account and I know I put the password and username in right
5436	0	a	This game is just bad. I took my time and gave it a fair play imo.  I guess if you like playing dress-up this game is for you.  The whole game is a Con and the only PRO you will hear is...Well you can change the color of your T-shirt,etc.  Boring world with the same missions on repeat. It is like being stuck in a smaller(much smaller GTA title.) with bad hitbox detection or flat out lag or something.No clue but this game can run on a toaster from 2005.  Cops and Crims. If it was as big as planetside 2,or gta v i'd play it again. But all these small scale fps war games suck and are flat out boring and a pain to play.  I am not going to list the bad things as imo the whole thing is utter garbage.
3606	1	a	really fun but make less updates please,either then that got to say AWSOME game!
7156	0	a	DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!
519	1	a	the game is cool
4046	0	a	The game isn't finished but the devs seem to think it is. Wait for it to get better before you start playing. That's my advice to you.
1419	1	a	Better than GTA5
8729	0	a	I do not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to play and have fun in it, I had to download the files, the install them on the launcher, and after that i had to fix corrupted files and then re install the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, not only that but whenm i finally got into the game i had to make a seemingly useless account so i can play, and once i did everything, made my character, chose a name, and finally picked a server, I got in and had great gameplay, no lag everything loaded fine, i could see the other players and i could see they custom shirts and what not, but i kept on getting kicked from game because of aparent 'slow internet' so when i kept try to play i kept getting kicked, so i really dont think this game is worth it, it looks fun, but it doesnt let you play, good job developers.
5426	0	a	  Not worth it at all....  You literally cant enjoy this game without spending a ton of money
5674	0	a	this 'amazing' gta/saints row clone is boring as crap. the cars handle poorly, you cant just kill who ever you want,the missions, god, the missions are just copy and paste robberies over and over again, oh and to get better stuff you need  purchase the 'full review' pack for only 5.99!
3353	1	a	Great game can be Paid to win, but you dont really need to pay it just makes it less of a hassle. If there are no people on the server it goes to crap because your stuck running around collecting things or having to play vs a very high ranked player and he just camps you over and over. Mic is required or fast typing skills lots of communication. Servers are dead lately so might want to check it out before you spend any money.
3460	1	a	this game is the best game of 2015 and will be for the rest of my life because it is all in one missions open world 3 person and i just think you who dont like it just dont comment   thank you abp  
9397	1	a	Its such a great game, but the whole fun is limited to buying a premium account
3963	0	a	I played this game for a long time, awhile back I was banned for absolutely no reason. I contacted support and they told me that they couldn't tell me why I was banned and to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off basically. So â¥â¥â¥â¥ the company that made this game, I hope that this game goes to a company that actually wants to make a game and not milk it for everything it's worth.
2888	1	a	It's really got a lot of potential and is already fun if you like games like Saints Row or GTA. It has a lot of customization features and in great detail as well. The only thing I don't appreciate is the rental systems for guns, and the over priced real money purcahses. So for a free to play game it's current structure of real money purchases is highly over valued.  7/10
3800	0	a	Hey everyone,  first of all, don't mind how many hours Steam shows I have played because it is wrong. I played this game at least 300+ hours and have a 178 ranked character.  Now, I have started playing this game a few years ago and I have always had troubles with it.  It is a game you really want to love but you can't and I will tell you now why.   THE GOOD    + Character creation and customization  The game has an amazing character creation and plenty of customization options that I have yet to seen a better version in similar games.   + Cars  There are enough number of cars to keep the variety and they can be customized as well.   + Customization and personification  The game both in its character creation and car customization offers enough tools to create your own unique look in the game.   THE BAD    - Lack of new content  Since the time I started playing this game, it hasn't changed much at all.  It has basically only a few game modes that have stayed the way they are for a very very long time.   - The story  The game does have a story at the beginning but it is non-existant through out the rest of the game. Of course you can't expect a rich story from this kind of a game but since it doesn't have much else to offer, it could be nice to at least have a story.   - Server issues and lag  The game has been and still is barely playable with its sever issues and constant lags. It has suffered from these problems for a long period of time and unfortunately it doesn't get any better. This makes especially driving a horrible experience since they are server based.   - Premium membership and cash shop  The game suffers from unbalanced premium weapons which are overpowered compared to in-game weapons.   - Graphics   The graphics are not too bad and could be overlooked if the game had a solid gameplay and at its current state they look dated.   CONCLUSION   The game has a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn't do muchto explore the possibilities both in its gameplay and story. Apart from having an excellent character creation and customization, the game unfortunately doesn't have very much to offer with its repetitive gameplay.
1583	1	a	1 of the words best game 
9492	0	a	Dumb game has bad graphics, actually didn't mind the ok combat and art style, the little story I read was not interesting enough to engage me, and I couldn't pass this one door in the tutorial because I for some odd reason able to destroy the only key to open the door so I couldn't even play past the first like hour.
10372	0	a	overall boring and difficult to really get into, the FPS elements are there but just not nearly refined enough to really attract a serious fan base other than people who have awesome computers to run it at maximum..With the release of it on Steam the bugs and server issues have gotten much much worse, and lag and really low Frame rates is more than common. Generally i give this game a 4/10 good idea, good back ground, great presentation, but poor game play, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor mechanics
10649	1	a	Steep learning curve but fun as hell.
6462	0	a	this game sucks, windows defender blocking .exe, u cant skip intro screen -&gt; making my brain explode because the volume is over 9000, after downloading it says wrong installation pls deinstall -&gt; i not even played this game but hell it sucks
718	1	a	it doesnt start ? i had the same problem , so what could i do ? i went online and dowloaded it from gmaerfirst online its run a little lagy at time thats cuase my computers shityy and my bro plays t aswell. custimisation is AMAZING i spent 5 hours on this and a long long long LONG time playing having fun , issions, and money , obioslly it cost a little bit for good things but i havent spent â¥â¥â¥â¥ and im still enjoying it .
9178	1	a	I loved this game, it's just so addicting! The only problem I have withit is the ocasional lag. But besides that it's fun!
7610	0	a	APB:reloaded.... i simply dont like this game, everything, EXACTLY everithing MUST BE PAY2WIN, also the missions are bad. this is my personal opinion btw... if you like open world but hate p2w (pay2win) then simply dont download this game.
3834	0	a	This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential. The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers. I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 2000 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.  Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.
7601	0	a	This game had a good cocept when the previous company had it. This game can be fun, but every single server you will encounter hackers and more bs. It's mostly a buy to win game, and they're milking it at this point.
4749	0	a	The worst company =&gt; Unnecessary gamersfirst =&gt; Inane apb rel... They do not deserve you
2287	1	a	 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APB:_Reloadedi :  APB: All Points Bulletin is a multiplayer online video game for Microsoft Windows based in urban sprawls and featuring two factions, Enforcers and the Criminals. Players can join either the Enforcers or the Criminals, and form sub-groups in either faction. The game design was led by David Jones, who contributed to the original Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown, and was developed by Realtime Worlds. It was released on 6 June 2010 in North America, and Europe.  On 17 August 2010 Realtime Worlds was placed into administration. The administrators intended to keep the company trading whilst they attempted to find a buyer for the firm. If a buyer could not be found then the long-term future for the game was uncertain. On 16 September 2010 Realtime Worlds announced APB servers were to be shut down 'soon' with no specific date given. On 11 November 2010 online games company, K2 Network, purchased APB for Â£1.5 million. No time frame for re-release or reactivation of servers was announced. On 16 November 2010 K2 subsidiary company Reloaded Productions, announced that APB will be relaunched during the first half of 2011 as a free to play game, renamed APB: Reloaded. ----------  I bought the game so I was bummed when they ended up tanking, I found it worth the money, but it was good news that they found someone to pass the torch to. Even though being f2p it is mainly for aesthetics and permanent guns but you can still purchase the same weapons that last temporarily with in-game money you earn from missions and killing other players and still have customizable things you can earn to make your character look unique which I believe is very in depth. One of the coolest things about this game is the ability to create your own artwork with shapes and various tools which some people can create some of the coolest detailed things with to apply to clothing and your own personal vehicles.   I highly recommend it given that it is the best f2p game in this genre like GTA available and the combat is challenging and action packed with grenade throwing, vehicles exploding, and bullets flying. It is even possible to place players on the criminal faction 'under arrest' with stun gun weapons and hand cuffs can earn more points. It is also hilariously humiliating to them and you can often hear them curse over the built in VOIP which makes it even better to feel like you've put scum in it's place.
3793	0	a	G1 is a company run by money sucking vampires that only care about your wallet.
2405	1	a	APB Reloadeed will give a hard time to newbies, it's best to start with friends which are higher level, but overall, without the hackers and stuff, it's a pretty good game !
1726	1	a	Really fun, more friends you play with the more fun this game can be.
5160	0	a	full of cheaters
3791	0	a	A joke of a game, when all is said and done about the game.  The game offers a lot that many other games do not, meaning it's near endless levels of customization from your character, to your vehicles and your weapon (albeit pre-made skins upon your weapon.) The gun game, whilst often subject to horrid servers is satisfying, regardless of it's Call of Duty-like TTK (Time To Kill) meaning that most fire-fights will be over very swiftly. The game suffers from a plethora of issues however, and many of them are game-breaking.  There is a heavy influence of cheaters in the game, and they are not removed appropriately quickly due to the anti-cheat measures put into the game prioritizing microtransactions from the cheaters instead of increasing the quality of the game by banning them as quickly as possible - which is a very shady practice seeing how it's a lose-lose situation.  The community is probably the most toxic and vile you can find. I have never seen such a hateful community anywhere else which directly affects gameplay as you will find many people griefing your mission and other missions just for the fun of it for them. This is also why it is almost impossible to stream this game and have a remote amount of viewers, as many will target you for griefing.  The development behind the game is barely there, and they also do very shady practices. They falsely ban players with zero evidence of them cheating or the like, or simply ban them because they receive too many reports about the players without checking into their playstyle and seeing if they are good, or cheaters. GMs are non-existant, they are very few and very rarely around - even when they display themselves, they hardly do anything against blatant cheaters.  The development team has zero clue about the metagame, what should be fixed and what should not be fixed, along with pretending some things are not an issue - server issues being a particular subject they prefer to avoid.   If you have a severe case of masochism, it is worth trying out. I have played it for many hours, and I have an entire channel dedicated to the game on YouTube. If you want a game that is as new player hostile as Dwarf Fortress without one ounce of it's depth, this is it. This game breaks friendships faster than Mario Party 2.  If you want to play a third person shooter that's free to play and something to just calm down to, I would probably keep looking elsewhere.

After waiting for the game to fully download, register to play, then the installer install the game, I found out I couldnt play the game just because my computer didnt fit their expectations, pathetic! Not buying a product from this compnay and I suggest you follow the same, if I want to play a game, and download it, it should not stop me from playing it
5990	0	a	GTA for poor people  Pros -... -Riddled with hackers yet not as many as GTA V currently has?  Cons -Pay to win -Extremely boring -Toxic community -Only way to make the real cash is by either paying for it or by playing a hundred PvP missions, or a thousand PvE missions, it's like you're getting punished for not wanting to play against other players, which is extremely dull. -All the cars are basically one big hitbox, you can't shoot people through car windows and the top speed is basically the same for all vehicles. And if you want to customize your character or vehicles to a higher extent you need to pay real money for PREMIUM.  To sum it up. It's dull as â¥â¥â¥â¥.

6922	0	a	The Pay2Win level of this game is just........ It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs. I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end. I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now. The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player.... You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies. But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just.........  But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously
485	1	a	really awesome but high pc requirements... cant wait for the ps4 version to come out

1940	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. Too many hours have been spent playing it. Lots of customization with generic TPS combat.
6792	0	a	This game is the drunken asian Grand Theft Auto. (No racism intended). The tutorial gives you a nice feel for the game, which is good, i liked that, but the game itself has a large delay, driving is near broken, and the graphics, arent all that great at all. I mean hey its played by lots of people, but personally this is just a waste of time.
2212	1	a	Great game, sort of. The guns are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, you could shoot somebody point blank in the head and they could turn around and kill you with their pay to win guns. A massive pay to win game, bullet damage of a North Koreans nutsack.
6444	0	a	Unless the game gets a major FPS fix its not worth the space
4986	0	a	This game sucks if you dont have real money. You only will be pwned by Professional P2P players.

5442	0	a	We seriously need to delete this one from our memory.
1225	1	a	I do recommend this game, but under certain conditions.   For starters, you can not play this if you take gaming seriously. There is no matchmaking in this game at all. They claim that matchmaking is done by your ranking in the game, however their ranking system is complete and total crap. I made a new character earlier, to test this. With my BRAND NEW character, I did ONE mission. On this mission, I got one kill, and died around 7 times. (Behold, pay to win aspects, will detail later). After the mission was over, I was rocketed from bronze one, to silver 3. I skipped ALL the bronze ranks because of ONE kill.   Now maybe, you'd think, they would at least make the game fair to free players. Not everyone has money they can spend, right? How about, instead, they market their microtransactions to give you game breaking advantages that allow you to dominate every player who doesnt have them. If you get matched up against a pay-to-win player, as a free player, you can reserve your cemetary plot now, because you wont stand a chance.   'But Akalron, they have to make money right?' Yes, of course a company needs a way of generating revenue, but ruining a free players experience is not a proper way to do that. I have played FTP games where the company did just fine by selling cosmetics, not advantages. APB COULD have easily done this, but they took a less retroactive approach to it. Granted they probably generate more revenue this way because of all the players who desire a win that bad.  Heres my favorite part however. I can deal with the pay-to-win, I can deal with the bad matchmaking, but what I can't begin to fathom is their lack of optimization. This game has been out for years, and yet it still runs like its in pre-alpha development. Textures load slower than a snail, the game constantly freezes up (usually in the middle of driving or a fire-fight. Hope you didnt want to avoid hitting a wall or dying.) The loading times are atrocious. The only thing slower than how slow the textures load is how long the game takes to actually open.   My computer is no potato, I have no problems running any of the other 150+ games I have, but when this game sits there loading the district select screen for over 5 minutes? What on earth is this? Are they so focused on adding more over-powered guns for their revenue that they dont care about optimizing performance? Or are they just banking on computer hardware advancing faster than their games requirements?   I do have some positive things to say about the game however.   I have a blast playing this game. It is fun after it finally loads. Its a fantastic blend of GTA and Saints Row. It has a lot of (unlockable) customization, but also takes its gameplay moderately seriously. If you go in expecting to have fun, not expecting to win, you will enjoy yourself.   I recommend playing with friends, because if you do decide to do missions, being able to communicate will assist in winning even against pay-to-win players.  Steal a van, hop in with all your friends, vibe out to the ingame radio and gun down pedestrians like a boss. Enjoy yourself.  And for you developers who may or may not read this review: For the love of god, please fix your game, its too much fun to watch it slowly die off. I've worked for a game with a similar market strategy, and lets just say, they didnt do well. Take that as you will.
1920	1	a	this game is awsome
10461	0	a	IT'S PAY TO WIN!
8659	0	a	At first I thought I found the basic version of GTA V but I was dissapointed. Even though it says 5.5hours on my profile, 4 of those hours were spent trying to log in. My computer back then wasn't a pathetic piece of equipment but was actually rocking a core i7 @ 2.2Ghz, 6GB RAM and a GT520M. So it all landed back to APB having a bad community and little to no support. After successfully logging in, I found the game to lack anything that would keep me hooked and want to come back and play it again.
6000	0	a	there is to much hacking in this game ... and to much pay to play for a free to play game .. and the game has not had one true update from the day it was made . it needs a UI and game play update bad..  give this game -1 out of 1-10
2083	1	a	Hack ur azz off AKA APB! Good game to fuel the rage!
10123	1	a	i absoulutly love this game. First time i have ever found a game with great deatail and lil to no lag .
2773	1	a	This is quite possibly one of the worst games I've ever played- No balance and lackluster story make this game more of a chore than entertainment.
8905	1	a	I consider myself very discerning when it comes to games. I don't play very many, but the ones I do play I tend to play a lot. More often than not I'll find myself getting bored of whatever game I'm trying out within the first few hours. I decided to try this game out and take a chance on the mixed reviews after seeing it on Steam many many times.   At 30 hours in I can safely say I'm hooked. The crafting system really is AMAZING. Potions, poisons, medical kits, weapons, armors, clothing, dyes, VEHICLES (including but not limited to motorcycles, ATV's, cars, trucks), and you can craft create temporary building and camps. That's just a small portion of it.  Skill system is easy to use and straight forward, combat is familiar and was easy to transition to, not sure what else I can say.   On the negative side, the game world coudl use some more clutter. Wandering around the map feels quite barren. And the server downtimes need to be addressed. This is killing this game for me despite all the great potential it has. I've been playing it for 5 days and the servers have gone down for 1 hour intervals at least 3 times and has gone down for extended intervals on anther two seperate occasions. This is on top of regular maintenance. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Despite this I'll give this game a positive review and recommend it assuming this one huge issue will be fixed ASAP
4888	0	a	I heard a lot about this game from my friends, unfotunately I cannot get it to run on my 280x for god knows what reason, it updates nicely and then fails at launch..  I've tried every possible solution to it, no luck so far.  I'm running Windows 8.1, drivers are up-to-date.
7336	0	a	hate it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6610	0	a	I Play this for may Hours. Many Many hours through there opener not steam and well it got worse as i played i loved this game Sunk hours of my life in to it but in the end Quit from disappointment the game population has dissappered as well.  I could go well in to depth about why im dissapointed but it would be very very long
9415	0	a	For some reason i cant play it, it lags and crashes when i press the TAB key to attack. So yeah,not happy about that.
7878	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
1087	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
4314	0	a	Just spend $50 on GTA;V- you will not regret it, this game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash.
679	1	a	lol cool game but storyless
1752	1	a	Would be an AMAZING game if there were no hackers.
8458	0	a	Edit: Basically take all my negative aspects of this review and amplify them and you have an up to date review...  APB: Reloaded is a online 'Cops-and-Robbers' third person shooter game. Gameplay revolves around joining one of two factions, the Criminals or the Enforcers, and then competing in open-world objective-driven missions throughout various districts in the fictional city of San Paro.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of APB is what drives it. It takes an old classic concept (Cops vs. bad guys) and puts a whole new spin on it. Customization of your character is incredibly vast. You can personalize your character's appearance, vehicle, 'theme song,' graffiti logo, and weapon (to an extent.) The physics in the game are a bit exaggerated which often lead to funny, if not frustrating moments. Combat can be fun if you know what you're doing or are playing with people at your skill level.   In that regard, APB does have a match-making system that's good at generally picking out who's a newbie (bronze level) and who's a pro (gold level), but once you get down into it the game just pushes silver players and gold players together which can be frustrating if the game misinterprets whether the player is actually ready to be in that bracket. FINALLY, and this is important. The game does have pretty shameless elements of P2W (Pay 2 Win.) There are weapons that can only be obtained through purchase with actual money and do provide a decent advantage over players who don't pay anything.  Visuals: Graphics hold up decently to more modern titles. While there's certainly no comparison to the next-gen iteration of Grand Theft Auto V, APB took a smart route by utilizing a more cartoon-y look. It's not a photo-copy of reality, but it's not trying to be. That said, it still looks quite good.  Community: This is something that needs to be said about this game. The community is, by-and-large, not the friendliest group of people on the planet. This is partly to be expected from the players of a game where crime, and stopping it by whatever means necessary, is the name of the game. However, I'm not sure I know of a game with more trash-talking and general inconsideration this side of Call of Duty. Asking for help will either get you scoffed at, or given just enough help to get by, and THEN scoffed at. If you want to play with a group of people who aren't ego-maniacs or raging craphats, disable District Chat and invite your friends to play the game with you.  Overall: Don't get me wrong, this game was a big part of my downtime during Spring Break. When trolls and tryhards aren't gunning you down continually with overpowered P2W weapons, this game is a ton of fun. Occasionally you'll find a match that actually accomodates your skill and everyone will be in the same boat as you, and you'll have a blast. Practice and you'll sometimes find yourself top of the scoreboard for a match or two. Just don't take it too seriously, it is afterall just a game. But if you're someone who prone to raging at video games to the point of breaking things, you might need to look elsewhere.
5685	0	a	APB would be a recommend IF they 1) stopped premade gold(high threat good players) from making premade groups and farming new players on what is supposed to be a beginners server. They have ignored this issue and literally chased off 90% or more(no exaggeration) of their playerbase. Sort of the Obama of Developers, ignore the problem until it becomes so bad that they are forced to and then instead of taking action they say 'We are looking into it, bear with us a few years and we will probably do something about it' meanwhile it only gets worse.  2) Do even more about hackers. Fairfight was the first real step the developers took in combating Hackers, again only out of the exodus of players from the game because of it. They knew it was a problem in Beta and ignored it completely until 4 years later when combined with the problem I mentioned in the First point, the population is so sparse and they hardly make money.    The Good: 1) Customization is amazing. By far the most customizable game I have come across as far as looks, music and graphics. Simply put, Amazing.  2) WHEN you get a fight of somewhat even teams, it can be so much fun it is almost worth dealing with the 2 problems listed above. But even on Bronze server, which is where brand new players start, games which you will not face a premade group are maybe at best 50%. The premade groups you do fight against will be gold or highly experienced silver(they do tricks to lower their threat level so they can keep farming bronze for easy wins which I guess is fun to them) armed with rocket launchers, high level weapons modded out and grenade launchers.    TLDR: Unless they fix the bronze servers instead of just talking about it as well as improve their hack detection even more, stay away and do not reward the developers.
6327	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks! its not a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gta game! 
4632	0	a	Wow, ok. So apparently they made this free to play. So, long ago I had actually BOUGHT this game and up until about 2014 I had it in my steam library, because it was a purchase. Well, I go to play some today (2016) and find that it was removed from my account, either because they 're-released' it, or because they voided my purchase. Anyway, I go to download it and notice that it isn't 'free to play' but actually 'free to pay' NINETY-NINE F'ING DOLLARS FOR DLC?! THIRTY DOLLARS? The developers also don't know how to do DLC because they have the same DLC pack for both $29 and...free....So, let me see, you delete the game (which I paid for), didn't issue me a refund, and now expect people to pay $139 for your DLC which adds basic game functionality to it? Oh, yeah, they also have a habit of deleting your accounts due to 'database malfunctions'. (see 2011) HA! No way I would recomend this. This was a dead game back in 2011 and now, under the tyranical control of the new 'developers' (must be french for check cashers), has become not only a joke but a steaming pile of feces.
3011	1	a	Very fun game, and in some aspects beats GTA...
7410	0	a	Crashes to much as soon as I get in game  
3437	1	a	although my email doesn`t work for some reason the gameplay is pretty good

3973	0	a	I thought it wasn't any good out of ten i would give it a 1 because you have to make a account first. Plus it is saints row but rubbish so my opinion is just get GTA or Saints row, they are better because APB is cheap you can't do half the things you can in GTA.PLease don't get it. this is my experience and you would know what I mean.

4957	0	a	2015, already ruined.
4757	0	a	This game is garbage and so is Gamers First.
6140	0	a	While this game is very good on its idea, it's extremly hard for new players to get in. I really liked the game, but even with many years of expierience in multiplayer shooters, if you don't pay real money for your equipment, including weapons, you're basically screwed. This is to my opinion the best example to show the great unbalance between Free2Play and Pay2Win gamers. No chance.  You'll lose the whole. damn. time. at every single mission and this takes the whole fun out of a basically good game.
3024	1	a	I do have an Alt which I have about 3k hours on, and by far this game is amazing. Except for some of the people I know, they're â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Plus, the hackers too, but Fairfight gets em'.   Def. Recomend this game.

5300	0	a	5 years later and this game is still garbage.
1421	1	a	I made nazi uniforms for myself and friends, I then discoverd nazi iconography is now banned in the game. My friends and I pondered why this was so while standing on top of a burned-out car seeing who could shoot civilians at the greatest distance with the stock handgun.  I then saw a poster depicting one of the 'My Little Ponies' getting sodomized by a man, which is apparently ok to show in-game.  
8774	0	a	I have been playing this game for a while now, and it was really fun until I join a financial server, then it brings me back to the menu saying my account has been permanently suspended. I'm just happy I didn't spend a single cent on this game.
1981	1	a	this is a great game, just get it it's free for F***SACKE!
816	1	a	I made a boobie girl character and my friend was very excited. Better times, better times.

2031	1	a	This game basically ruined my computer, took me 2 days before it started running back to normal I can play this game at a decent graphic setting but this game is laggy, and very P2W.  Edit: Decided to play again and feels like it has improved pretty decently would recommend. Be warned that this game eats up your RAM.
7075	0	a	too many blueberries, everywhere i go i see blueberries
1186	1	a	im on both yes and no to this game.the bad thing is u need to use real cash to buy special equipment and the server lobby aint that good but still this is a good game
1038	1	a	My only advice to the people who wants to play this game is dont play it alone because when you are alone its really boring and lots of trolls will destroy your game experience.
3283	1	a	Great game if you can put up with the lag and occasional bull poop moment... has improved slightly over the years but they wont fix the servers for some reason...
1409	1	a	This game is So awsome i really recommend playing this if u love cops and robbers, teamdeath match games
5827	0	a	This game is kind of like gta except you can be a cop if you choose too it is not fun but its worth the install. it dont realy think its a very awesome game theres not much to do and everyone just goes of and does what ever the hell they want  Review 5/10  Rating Ma15 us i dont know eu rating pegi 18
6561	0	a	Very unfriendly to newcomers, hard to understand what you have to do, confusing HUD, too many indicators... Resuming: too confusing. Didn't enjoy it, not likely to play it again.

7485	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
7078	0	a	i dont recomend this game it has bad graphics and is so fake its crazy
5285	0	a	This game originally failed because of core problems that existed in the game and the complete ineptitude of the developers (when they were Real Time Worlds) to fix or at the very least alleviate these problems.  Now on top of those issues you have an utterly broken cash shop system that will ruin your experience 95% of the time.  To start I should address some of the original problems that plagued the game on it's original releaes, guns were (and still are) terrible to use and the application of modifications does not make that any better. The gunplay feels clunky and the recoil on most weapons make it impossible to hit anything less than 5 feet infront of you. that is unless you use specifc weapons.  Cars are in the same boat as guns, for a cops and robbers MMO, you think they would be able to get the driving down. This is not the case. The car physics are terrible and they don't control that great either.  The mission system is absolute garbage, you can follow through multiple objectives, winning one after another. but if you fail the final one (, you will instantly, ignoring the fact taht you and your side were dominating the opposition;; fail the entire mission (And I find this happens more for the enforcer faction than the criminal faction, in all my time playing). This is further problematic with the addition cash shop weapons.  Now your thinking: Wow, hopefully the new developer and publishers would of picked up this game up and would of tried to fix these issues, which while do not make the game unplayable, do not provide an enjoyable experience for prolonged periods of time.  Well, no. They ignored these issues.  And I haven't even mentioned the games instability, poor performance even with modern hardware. or the failure for the game to completely shut-down once your done playing (One of the processes used in the game will ALWAYS STAY UP).  What they did bring to the game. was one of the worst things they could of done. They added a cash shop for guns, no no, not cosmetics. these guns have an actual performance advantage over other guns that you can actually aquire through gameplay.  These wonderful items provide superior damage, little to no recoil in addition to some other effects they can provide.  This damages the poor mission matchmaking and balancing because if your enemy team has these weapons, and you don't well, your screwed. in laymans terms.  Now to be fair, the new devs have actually added some content in the game with the addition of the 'Chaos district' and in game events. These aren't that great though, they aren't even the quality of the RTW content (Which isn't that great either), and the events are hampered by people rampantly cheating. Which I forgot to mention, is incredibly commonin this game (from outright use of hacks, to exploiting faults with the game or going out of bounds.)  the only positive thing I can say about the game is it's customisation system. and, unfortunately ,that hasn't seen any improvements since release of the ORIGNAL release. There is very little added to customise yourself since then (that that which is added is cash shop items -- go figure.) and while the emblem creator is nice and all that, if you don't have the ability to use it (since you cannot import emblems and pictures, you use geometric shapes to create them) thats just a wasted feature, and you will be dependant on the auction house to find anything you want. Which is ALSO an issue since people find it prudent to sell their crap for stupid huge amounts of money, and you can't filter or search by name of what your looking for. so if you want anything past 'T' for example. be prepared for LE EPIC TROLL FACE MEME XDDD!!! for the next 40 pages.  To sum this up: If your looking for a GTA MMO, this isn't that. go play GTA instead, if your looking for a fun Free-to-Play game, this Definitely isn't for you. becuase this game is by no means 'Free' and it's not fun either. I tried to cover everything I experience in my time playing this game, I probably missed something that would make me go for another 5 paragraphs. so it's best to stop here.  TL;DR: Games â¥â¥â¥â¥, p2w garbage. devs don't give a crap about the game and army of cheaters, go play some other game.
687	1	a	fun recomend good graphics card though

7043	0	a	Really, it isn't too much fun. You can't really change the look of your character, mission can be hard, everyone is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you're looking for an F2P GTA, this isn't what you came for. If you came for a TPS with some decently good graphics, hop onboard.
2488	1	a	All Points Bulletin has improved drastically from its original launch but isn't necessarily the MMO Grand Theft Auto we've been looking for.

5738	0	a	I remember when this game was just APB: All Points Buletin and man does it still suck as much. I really want to enjoy this game because there are very few if almost no open world cops and robbers games. In short don't let the screenshots and videos fool you, yes the customization is deep and the emblem system puts games like COD Black ops to shame. Yet everything else about this game is subpar and broken. 6 years and there is still a massive pay to win system and it feels as if there is one giant hitbox and that is it. There is no visible difference to damage when you shoot someone in the head or in the bloody pinkie toe. As good as I want it to be and as much as I can forgive and forget to enjoy myself this is not one of those games. Save your time and your cash in p2w bundles and go play GTA Online instead.
2560	1	a	pay2win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that I will likely play again with my friends because I remember that my avatar in game is really tall, has a great tan, striped panties, and DEM HIPS. â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4726	0	a	Fairly depressing Has a lot of lag for the mode it's meant to be played in  Uninteresting visual style, art design, lack of variety. There are many other, better oprions if u want to play a mmo similar to this one 
8648	0	a	I probably haven't played APB Reloaded enough to call it trustworthy review. Still, there is a reason behind that. First of all, I played APB Reloaded over 2-3 years - first, when I just started my adventure with Steam, then few months later after some update and my last time was maybe half of year ago. Is this game bad? Not really. Is around 10 hours all the fun you can get from it? Probably not. When I started to play this game, I looked for something GTA-like but focused on online play.   And I found it. Played for a little while with my friend and we had some fun. Still, day after I started to play once again San Adreas multiplayer. After some time played it again and sadly, suddently this error on 32bit operation systems game wasn't playable at all. Some time later I changed my OS and tried it again. Sure, there were some players but once again I had fun only for short time. Played some missions together and one day uninstalled. Maybe it wasn't really for me? Or maybe because of lags, since there were countless time when I emptied my whole magazine shooting on enemy and didn't managed to kill him, only to find out that there was lag and I'm already dead.  I know one thing - it's free to play game, you can at least check it out. Maybe your experience with it will be much better and you will find something that is worth spending in your time. I probably won't install APB Reloaded again and even if I will, I doubt that my opinion will be changed.
849	1	a	good game but i suggest you get a group of friends before you play since you get trolls alot that will kill you for no reason but other than that it is a good game has good gameplay

8862	0	a	I was part of the beta testing for this game and played it up until the game went free to play and got sold to that third company, Gamers First.  When the game was handed over to that company I lost access to my old account and the characters on it. I followed the instructions to 'merge' my account to their new system and lost access in the process, I contacted them and received no response on the issue.  I tried making another account but found the game was being filled with microtransaction pay to win garbage so I just dumped the game.  The old Devs were actually active within the community, and very helpful.  The new Devs, in my short one sided interaction with them, are complete garbage.  This game had a lot of promise to it but was snuffed out by the new company's greed and lack of customer service.  This game is dead.
1180	1	a	vewry fun game a litlle laggy but its free 2 pay so i cant complain but overall very fun
6595	0	a	wont work just keeps on updating and it takes hell to try to start it
1213	1	a	A really good game with lots of customisation options, really fun to play with friends, it gets patched alot and the devs fix alot of bugs. The only 'big' problem of this game is the server lag that can sometimes annoy you and make you rage quit, but all in all its a really fun game :)
9923	1	a	Tl;Dr: Only just started playing (13hrs), but I'm already impressed. Imagine a mashup of: Star Wars Galaxies, EvE, Fallout, Mad Max, Revolution and Firefly and you're somewhere in the right place.  -----------------------------  I used to play Star Wars Galaxies, right from Beta until just before it closed and I've often looked for a game to fill the open world sandbox void that left behind. Fallen Earth really comes very close that that (actually it's better than SWG in almost every possible way - add houses and the ability to freely decorate and some equivalent of Space Ship combat and you've got a winner!).  The crafting system has good depth and is a heavily supported part of the game (lots to make, player auctions and pretty much every item is craftable). It's a true open world and seems to have an active community. I'm enjoying the combat system which is pretty much a FPS/3rd person style with the addition of having hotkey special actions.   The skill system is good, very open and it seems to be totally classless, you just level up the skills you want to use and can mix and match as much as you like (It reminds me of EvE in this respect). Most actions seem to earn you xp, so pretty much everything you do helps you level up, but I've not felt pressured into levelling at all.  The screenshots are a lie, the game doesn't look like that at all - or rather, you never see the game like that. I suggest watching some gameplay videos on Youtube to get a good idea what the game looks and plays like.  It 'feels' a lot like Skyrim/Fallout to me.  The missions/quests are actually really well done. They feel much more dynamic than those in most MMO's. There's nothing mind-blowing about them, but they are about as good as traditional fetch/kill/craft quests can get.  Haven't tried PVP at all, so far it seems to be either non-existant or a very tiny part of the game (at least in the area I'm currently in).   There are also dynamic events in the world, they appear to be little theme-park style things. I don't know how limited time they really are but they give the impression that they come and go, which is pretty cool.  Definitely one of the best MMO's I've played - nothing truly ground-breaking, but everything it does it does very well. I anticipate many hours of good fun with this game. The Free2play system isn't abused, mostly it's just timer buffs, a few extra crating/backpack slots and vanity items. I've not paid for anything yet and I've not felt at all like I'm being forced to pay if I want to get anywhere in the game, though because I haven't been forced to I'm very much inclined to look into the subscription to see what's on offer.
1418	1	a	Awsome game GO AWAY REVIEW THING
9961	1	a	Fallen Earth could be better but it's still not a bad MMO to play to get away from more mainstream MMO's.
4410	0	a	Really wasn't what I expected honestly.
6197	0	a	too many hackers and cheats the game is rather pointless and greatly unplayable because of this and the free to play is hugely limited and again pointless. I would rather put my money into a single player game before putting a dime into a cheater run disappointment like this. only thing thats worse than the world full of cheaters in this is the pathetic company that makes it impossibl to do anything about them, but then again why would they the cheaters are the ones giving them cash so like NFSW they will pander to the cheats as usual.
1767	1	a	Really fun to play once you get into it, easy controls, lots of customization :)
7160	0	a	MIDDLE EAST , ASIA , SE ASIA NO SERVERS .................... SO IT LAAAAAGGGSSS................... DAMN THIS LAG !!!  IT WOULD BE SUPERB IF THEY HAD STEAM SERVERS IT THESE PLACES  CAUSE THIS GAME IS REALLY NICE !!!
8626	0	a	Bad optimization, has a lot of bugs and the Dev's don't fix them Countlessly,shity server couldn't keep up  the DEV No communication, lies and not listening to the community  DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! Atleast not now. It as been release more then 6 years ago, and its sill in alfa '-' GG WP G1 :)
1944	1	a	this game is a waste of your life. BUT..... it is a very good waste of your life when you get in to the game
2241	1	a	Conclusion from an 4 years veteran playing from 2012 (200 hrs on steam but over 1000 on gamersfirst) :  Customazation is sick, by sick i mean very good and you can customize every single part of your car/clothes. The game isnt pay-to-win how others say, you can buy everything with in game cash and contacts maxed out. OP weapons that can be buyed with real money? YES, but the game isnt ptw at all. I never spent money on this game and i played for 4 years. The game is fun with friends/clan/groups, without them if you go solo there are chances to lose because of bad teammates. The community in-game is toxic but on the forums its really helpful. The servers are practically 'sh*t'. Lag spikes everywhere for medium PCs and connection problems. The developers arent the best either, they want to come with a new engine upgrade (hope that this will fix lag spikes) but we havent heard anything from them ever again. I can understand them as before gamersfirst took over the game from REALTIME WORLDS they had a bunch load of prgrammers..and now with GAMERSFIRST there is only a Lead programmer who is forced to learn the way the programmers before him coded. The games has much potential but GAMERSFIRST is kinda broken. If you want to enjoy a game like GTA, APB is the thing for you but dont spend too much time or money on it, as i assume this game will shut down somewhere in the near future and your progression will be lost. This is my conclusion over the years. Lets all hope APB will be the same as it was before GAMERSFIRST took it over. I rly recommand it if you like GTA games so i will give it a YES!
7512	0	a	Full of hackers, and the dev team is lazy as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8651	0	a	I dislike the clunky controls, yeah, theyre all customisable but its a game, i just wanted to be dropped straight into this with the controls set up for Xbox controller without having to faff about.Tthe graphics are 2004 spec, and leave a lot to be desired. if you like clicking menus and mucking around customising T-shirts, and bits and pieces like your nose, and the shape of your lip then it may be what you're looking for. Sadly i wasnt. I was looking for something to get stuck into, like GTA, but instead its just menu after menu of tiny icons and numbers followed by crappy visuals and clunky controls. I gave up in the end and generally regret wasting my time downloading the 5.3GB, failed updates and a restart, mucking around with making an account and creating a character.  Not for me im afraid, will be un-installing shortly as i lack the patience to withstand the drawn out menus to ever achieve anything, let alone control the character properly or be pleased by the visuals, Sorry
9347	1	a	great game love everything about it...its different and IMO better than your classic style MMO which is well all there is right now. It doesnt hold your hand as much as blockbuster MMO's do. but it does help you along just enough that you wont flounder for to long unaware of what to do next. It has real genuine challenges, no bogus strings or restrictions you wouldnt expect. basically anything you want to do you can do it. it has hardcore elements that are in the player universe but are kept far enough away for the msot part that if you dont want to be a part of it you dont have to be.  only downside I can see is it needs a major overhual fairly soon. graphics and animations need to be redone and brought into 2015. if they did that this game would skyrocket to success no doubt about it
6158	0	a	You can put swastikas on your car and block spawns with a garbage truck but the combat system sucks â¥â¥â¥ and there's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of premium. 2/5
9328	0	a	The uninstall button works pretty well 10/10

1531	1	a	Very realistic game. Recommending it for everyone.
589	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
278	1	a	best game ever I played in my life.. just needs some fixes with the driving lag.. and a Suggestion Why not add scope to snipers? 
9778	1	a	Great Game played it long before it came on steam.
4335	0	a	I have a 6 month old gaming PC with a top shelf GeForce GTX card and the game errors out at start that my graphics card is not supported. Waste of time downloading and not worth my time trying again in the future.
3794	0	a	Four long years ago, when i first started playing, i wrote a review, basically saying this game will find what is wrong with your computer and profusely let you know about it. To this day i still use this game to iron out driver kinks and test hardware for faults. No clue why, but this game seems to be the best at letting you know whether or not your computer is worth its weight. Still does too.  For now, i'm going to speak more into the game, more in depth on the content and world of APB:R, and its affects to real life issues.  The game is beautiful, and has so much potential, the world is still caughing up silly little secrets and jokes that even the most seasoned vet of the title has yet to discover. There was a mobile app built that lasted roughly through beta, died out from the toxicity of the community, even though the community had actually asked for it. If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums. There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program. The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place. OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process. I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was 'Gaming grade' unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R. Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of 'be what you cannot be' too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.  People don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.  The game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker. The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection. The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control. So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back. The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as 'Spray n pray' or 'all out balls to the wall firefights' now, well now it's just depressing.  The game itself is the hacker... This has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high. I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get. Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game. Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!  The silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker... This can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways. However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is 'take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community.' I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen. Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails. I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)  The company that handles APB:R aka 'Reloaded Productions' or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking. They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.  The base game though... The game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect. And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot! Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on... Now if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to 'fix' something. I cannot stress this enough... The devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.  This game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system. Are you interested in playing the game? Wait, just wait. Do i recomment you play the game? Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine. Is this game worth it? So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.
285	1	a	its an okay game but hard for new pepole
770	1	a	This Game is Awesome. The Unlimited Customization of Character And Cars makes it total worth a try. You create your own Identity or you copy an existing humanoid character from anywhere. Such as Ronald McDonald as an Example. I total Recommend this game if you like GTA and FPS Games
491	1	a	G1 finally banning cheaters. Best game ever.

4454	0	a	game did NOT work I hate this
9673	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't enjoy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that makes no sense. When loading up the game it requires you to make a login, get it verified and all that jazz, but when it comes right down to it, it literally makes no sense at all. There is no username, and if you go into your account, there is a username with a weird series of numbers and letters, and even when putting those in, it does not work, so for those who do not have half an hour to spend â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around just trying to figure out how to get into the game, it's not good.
2134	1	a	You know, as much as I rage at this game, I find myself coming back to it time and time again. For one reason, it's addictive, you might have a bad day, not win a single damn mission, but, when you finally do, it's a feeling so damn sattisfying that you can't help but cheer. If you're a fan of third person shooters and Online play with against and with other players, this is deffinatly a game I would recomend. Another reason as to why I enjoy this game so much is due to the sheer ammount of custimization possible. Especially with premium. With premium membership, you can place up to fifty. Yes, 50 different designs on a peice of clothing, not to mention tattoos, hairstyls, a full face custimzation with pleanty of sliders to play around with to get it just right. Try it, you just might like it.
7611	0	a	I will say this, I wanted to go back to this game after playing it during my highschool days and dropping it after say a few months.  The game is amazing on customization as in beautifully stunning in the fact that EVERYTHING can be changed with your character (Clothing to body) and Cars and guns (albeit with premium limitations on designing) but beyond sitting in the hub far from the sh!tstorm that is the open world of APB:R, there isn't much more to be said about it, if anything I would rather pick up the game just to twiddle with the fun customization stuff you can do than hoping and praying that I can have a fun firefight with all kinds of players that isn't laggy or one sided on who has a sniper/rocket launcher or an ARMAS bought gun.

10305	0	a	Not very good. Even for free. Not worth the time.
2417	1	a	i really like this game as a free alternate of Grand Theft Auto and some parts of the Newesat game to the Ubisoft Librtary,Watchdogs,really fun

6583	0	a	Just terrible. I played it for 20 mins and deleted it when I realised it's just a tacky rip off of GTA.
7486	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
4054	0	a	A fun game to goof around with friends on, but there are too many Pay-2-Play players and cheaters plauging the servers to have fun.
3674	1	a	good game good game i dont even like this game 10/10 I would install and uninstall this game!

10628	1	a	Best free skiing simulator that happens to have guns.
10082	1	a	Good game, kinda like fallout, i can see myself getting into it.
7522	0	a	Filled with bugs and really badly written. Should be alpha mora than an actual release.
10475	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department? There is nothing quite as rewarding as savaging through mounds of garbage, collecting various long rusted do-dads, and long forgotten whats-its to make various deadly weapons to gut, barrage, or otherwise eviscerate various pus drooling mutants.  Okay, so the crafting is still varily limited. But compared to most MMORPGS it is still rather 'up there' on the scale of awesome. Combine that with real time FPS combat (which still boils down to a-typical pulling and grinding, admitably) and you got yourself some fun times.  The game is rather graphic intensive, but after kicking the graphics down even my laptop with it's outdated drivers and such was capable of running it releatively smoothly. Grab a friend, get your horse and hit the waste! It's time to launch your career as a down and dirty, gun toting scavager!
3200	1	a	JUST THUG LIFE!
3839	0	a	This game had so much potential. But the develepors ruined it with these things -Pay to win You could literally just buy your way through the game, I mean, every time you entered the shop you would see things you could only buy for cash -Lack of tutorial There was really no way to know what you were doing in this game. They just drop you in the world and expect you know what to do -Lack of Diversity This game felt the same. The guns felt the same, The cars felt the same, The missions felt the same, and it all just blended into a big gray lump of boring
10286	1	a	i havent played much but heres what i think so far. The community is amazing most people are friendly when i made my character almost immediately was i invited to a clan from then he gave me a more in depth tutorial bought me a horse and some feed . graphics amazing considering its f2p . gameplay good but the crafting is a little confusing but once you figure it out its smooth sailing . overall 9.7/10 not perfect but close fed my thirst for more games like fallout
6895	0	a	The customization level of this game is unmatched by any other game. Unfortunely thats the whole highlight of the game. The gun play is really horrible, with terrible gun balance and lots of bunny hoppers. The matchmaking is an aboslute joke. The driving is sub par, but playable. The maps are great for driving around on, but not really fun for gun battles. The whole of the game from start to finish is random groups of people gunning down other random groups while safe neutrals troll you. Lastly the marketplace prices are insane. $20-$30 USD to unlock one gun for your account, Their supposed to bring out a new engine at some point to fix a lot of the issues, but until then its just not worth playing.
2871	1	a	awesome game anyone wanna come on it 
1037	1	a	I do this stuff in real life on the norm. Word to yo motha
2872	1	a	this is a really good game if you want to play a game like gta 5 but dont have the cash to fork over. 8/10 overall

7520	0	a	Ain't !@#$ If everytime you load it and it ends up to 'Not Responding' -_-
4462	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
2821	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
6250	0	a	ok .  It look's nice in the pictures . But don't even try it . It dosen't even want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing load . I mean rly .  It takes ages for the damn screen to pop up . and when it dose 'not responding'
8330	0	a	What a waste of space on my disk. Where should I start? Graphics are terrible. Even for a f2p game they are bad, and I know how to make graphics for games so they just completly failed there. Most important issue is the game play on it's own. 3rd Person camera isn't the best, driving cars is just a joke - Even ps2 games had better driving controls than this. Maybe add some kind of objectives or mission that new players would understand? If they want to fix a game a new game engine would be a good start. If this game will get to a level of sainrows 3 or gta IV I will play but since I doubt it will ever happen you are getting negative review. Beside paying Â£22 for a dlc for this game is like a sin. From the money you made you should be able to make a good game, not a â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that. I will not go even to mentioning that the game crashes on first lanch and that I have to go to the task manager to fix it. 2/10
7506	0	a	Terrible performance on AMD graphic cards. Lots of memory crashs and couldn't find any help in the forum for my problems. Game looks on max settings almost like on minimum due to a lack of optimization. If it runs well on your system good for you but if not invest a lot of time in trouble shooting...
7046	0	a	One of the worst games you ll ever play. Its a pay2win game. Even though it tries not be it just cant. Its also one of the worst shooting games i ve ever played, because when you are in combat jumping around and running around will help you avoid bullets as well shooting while zig zaging around the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ place kill the oppoment. Snipers are not snipers, meaning that they dont even have a scope. its all 3rd person everybody! FU SNIPERS! Also the fact with cops vs criminals is one of the broken pieces of the game. 80 people max in a server. Every other server is empty. Did i forget to tell you that you rent guns? no? well you rend guns, cars , and lots of things that makes you baddass in this game for the max days of 10(atleast for guns i know of). I would rate the game 20/100 just because at first i had fun killing my other m8s because they killed me while investigating. I would recommend not getting involved with this game. Waste of time. IGN 10/10

Being that it is multiplayer Tribes: Ascend has netcode, and though all netcode is merely compensatory, which hinders this projectile-heavy game. Weapons fired in this game are delayed by ping and as such client-based actions do not determine the actions of the character leaving the player interactions with definitive inconsistencies.

52	1	a	I recommend this game. Most of this review comes from Last August, which was when I last put a lot of hours into the game. Recently I've been trying to get back into it. If you want to play with me, I'm looking for people to play with on the Joker NA server. Just started up a new character. Anyways, here's the review:  This game is a lot, and I mean a lot of fun. I'll be completely honest with you, there used to be a lot of server lag, but now it's perfectly optimized. It is so addicting and fun, with so many different customizations option for guns/clothing/vehicles/weapons it's just awesome. I LOVE this game. I'm finally getting back into it after a while.  The things that I dislike: The amount of time it takes to obtain a good amount of money. (it doesn't take that long if you have Premium.) Premium could have... a little more benefits. There seem to be a lot of cheaters. It's somewhat hard to obtain certain vehicles, and atleast on The Joker server, it costs a lot for a good vehicle/mod/weapon/theme song. That's pretty much it.

7293	0	a	I honestly can't recommend this to any new players out (me being one) just due to the fact of how behind you'll be. Now i only played a few hours of this and i will say that this has its goods and its bads.  The goods of APB is the detail it puts into your character, it's amazing; it even beats GTA5's customization with making your own cars, tattoos, decals, guns, and your characters body. The idea is also really good with cops and robbers kinda like a game me and my friends made in GTA4. If you feel like being a punk, pick the criminal; feel like justice, pick the vigilante both sides can just be a sheer blast.  Now the bads and the most obvious one (as you would expect from a free game) is microtransactions.Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game has as many microtransactions as a mobile game and this really kills the customization dramatically. Now i know that you can't get everything for free, but some of that â¥â¥â¥â¥ is like 5000$, which turns fun gameplay into a grind. It is incredible how much guns cost and the cheapest form of getting the better guns is to rent them for 10 days.....fun; not to forget that the tooltip at the bottom of the loading screen only tells me to buy more stuffz. Up next is the fr, i can run almost all my games at high quality and keep a steady fr, but this game manages to go from a steady fr to complete freeze and then back to normal i don't know if thats cause of my internet or not, but its really annoying. ( also i have the settings on max and alot of the textures are blurry). The last thing is the servers you can get into one pretty easily, but my god people are just bouncing around and freezeing up or 'rubber banding' I think is what it's called.  All and all this game had alot of potential as an awsome game. If this didn't have microtransactions and was a pay up front game it would be great, but the microtransactions, grinding, servers, and fr all ruin it for me just keep an eye out and maybe these guys will make a stand alone title. P.S Punk Buster......really....sigh...
7735	0	a	I thought to myself why not to try it since it's free to play. However I was quite disappointed. The best part is sadly the character editor. 3/10

4298	0	a	I'd review it if we could actually even play it!! The log-in process on this game is awful. My son, who just got his first lcomputer, downloaded it and was feeling jaded so I downloaded it and was doing no better than he was. I mean, have you ever actually gotten a person who knows nothing about the game to give it a test? All I know is that we followed the instructions and the f-ing thing wouldn't work.
9446	0	a	For some reason i cant play it, it lags and crashes when i press the TAB key to attack. So yeah,not happy about that.
4253	0	a	worst game ever,toxic community of â¥â¥â¥â¥ups
6957	0	a	It needs offline for people with no friends
7863	0	a	This game dont work! Dont have servers online ?! Ok! I dont recommend this game !
1408	1	a	A silly game that is limited to your creative.. and the sandbox missions. In reality this game beckons you to enjoy it and yourself. It's definitely a game that you want to sink your teeth in with friends, duke it out on the internet for a couple of hours and do it again and again! The game however much awesome it produces it's limited in a sense and to some this game might not meet their criteria of playable and 'fun' to a certain extent. If you're into goofy sandbox games that will have you laughing, screaming, crying, even vommitting at your screen, this is the game for you.  3/5 would bang.
6700	0	a	played this game before it was on steam and left cameback after awhile and left for good this time. This game is   HEAVILY   p2w it seems like, you have your 3 districts 2 fighting disctricts and 1 social district and you have fight club maps, the 'rank' system is based off of losing and winning which is dumb because if you go against p2w players you will lose you won't even have a chance the servers are kindaorienated towards your 'rank' you have green servers bronze servers and so on the hackers ruined this game p2w really ruined it not to mention all the lag respawn sometimes seems like it takes forever and fight club matches are extremely hard because of the lag and p2w players all the guns you get with in-game currency go away after a few days so yeah don't waste your time with it. -100/10

6573	0	a	This game ruined my computer.  It made my computer say 'Busy Writing On Disk' and i blame it on this game.   Pros: Customizable characters,lots of guns.  Cons:Laggy,hard,Pay 2 Win,Ruined Steam
8618	0	a	Has the worst matchmaking i've ever seen
2522	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
2355	1	a	its a cool game 
6994	0	a	Totall pay to win game, but still fun in a dumb way. 3/10 ign.
83	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
1915	1	a	This Game Is only fun with friends but if you are anti social and want to play a dumbed down GTA clone with other people this game is perfect for you

2986	1	a	I enjoyed this game for like two years i love every thing about it. just the only thing that sucks is that its pay to win most of the time.
2719	1	a	I love this game. I have played it for years. It's all pvp which keeps the game fresh mission to mission. The character, vehicle, and weapon customizations are awesome. My only suggestion is they should have cooler weapons and upgrades as awards for fight club. My biggest complaint is regulating people who use cheat mods...Gamersfirst has gotten better about it but there shouldn't be an ability to have them.
4920	0	a	Nearly all of the hours I have in this are updates.
6488	0	a	this game is very buggy it takes a long time to load i played for about a month and i couldnt handle playing anymore so im done with this but its realy fun.
381	1	a	Awsome game even tho they say that. Like gta lol. WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING GTA IF THIS IS FREE?!?!?!??!  good luck with the game  hope i dont do i thumbs down!  Thanks allways when im bored helps me alot.
2366	1	a	this game is really fun i you can make your car make your own chacter you can mug people theres drug missions i mean the game is like saints row dont listen to any body that dosent like it they might be gay im just saying you can have clans gourps and â¥â¥â¥â¥ oh whatever you do dont pic cop its not that fun lol i made my chacter as a old asin guy thats fat and whereing just his underwear lol
6657	0	a	I've been on this â¥â¥â¥â¥ train long enough to see that nothing changed since my last visit. The matchmaking still â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks cosmic balls, it doesn't matter what rank you're at be it 10 20 120 if you just started you gonna have your self a real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Getting in to missions against players like ranks 255 with ARMAS guns while you out there are buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing naked â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of luck and jolly well â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Unless you want to spend like 500$ at this game forget about having fun.  So yeah here's just a little rant about the stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ balls to the wall matchmaking they have in this game. It doesn't matter what rank you are how good you are the game it pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing simple - bronze - silver - gold - that's it that's literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing it, those 3 'Threat' levels - and it doesn't even care about anything else as long there are players on those channels. So prepare your self for 95% of the times for the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ grinding frustration of your life as you will be totally obliterated by the oposite team. FUN! Right? It all can be fixed by adding a proper functional skill system, locking the channels by ranks, making channels that deny use of ARMAS stuff, but the current owners and devs just don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥. I mean, while the money keeps rolling why fix it if it ain't broke, right?  To be honest this game has been for years around and really nothing has changed, no new districts, even fewer channels now, less people playing the game, the only new weapons and other stuff are behind a paywall. It had potential but they â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up.  Giving this game a rating would be like selling your soul to the devil.

8548	0	a	The game will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over.   You will play it.   And you will soon be trapped in it's loop.   You'll play it and then quit.   Suddenly three months go by like it was nothing.   You'll be stuck in this cycle.   You will play this game and then quit then back you go.   I'm installing the game as I type this.   The curse has come back to haunt me.   Please help me.

4065	0	a	Well, overall recomendations are about right. I just installed this game and played it for a couple of hours. First thing i notice, there is no new player support. You have to guess how everything works.  When u find out how the game works, you can finally start to play.  with 'play' i mean get shot by high ranked ppl, get things whispered at you (not the nice things), stare at the screen while respawning and wondering what the *beep* u installed.  Game looks fun, could be fun if its not for the terrible matchmaking and pay to win what makes the newbie kind of useless.
7442	0	a	Menus are messy, quests are hard, very pay to win, and hard to understand what youre doing.
5313	0	a	Meh. It's okay at best.
8883	1	a	First impressions:  As you can see (at the time of writing), I haven't played the game much, as such I can only write about first impressions.  Loading the game initially through steam, account setup is pretty basic (log in, verify e-mail, get to playing) except for one tiny detail... you can't choose your user name. The software generates a hash code for your name (around 20 characters in length including upper/lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens ( - ) ) and I have to say... the support team is *FAR* less than helpful (their response : we can't change unique user names)...  Okay, let me rant a moment... so what they're saying is their programmers can't use SQL? Can't use PHP? Can't... um... access their OWN databases? I think not... I think someone is too lazy to correct their mistake. Log in with an e-mail because 'that's the username'... but tried logging in with my e-mail and it says 'invalid username' but using the hash... all hunky dory.  There, that's out of the way, let's get to the game itself and not the customer service.  The game is old-school. The graphics sit somewhere between Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. The NPCs and 'Monsters' are all standing around in one place, tethered to a spot (where they will chase after you for a predetermined distance before giving up and returning to their spawn) ~ a lot like EverQuest 1. The world itself is a little on the empty side, but I cannot honestly say if it remains this way (the internal zones and buildings are pretty cool, and for a game that is set in a wasted world, it's as desolate as it should be).  The story-line is thoughtful and creative, even if it's a little flat and tired. It is interesting, it is engaging, it's just that it's a bit 'old.'  The GMs are super helpful, and I've seen them online every time I've logged in. The help channel is busy, and responsive (I can't even begin to say how refreshing that is)! That said... they have the typical censored chat system that is pretty much par for the course... but don't bother censoring your own words (like: aw s*** that sucks) because a GM will threaten to mute you for language (a redundancy which borders on zealous). Hardly anything to complain about... keep it clean (and PG so you don't offend the super-innocent teenagers playing this game - note sarcasm).  Movement is a bit cumbersome and unweildly ~ but once you're used to it it isn't too bad (such as hitting tab or the middle mouse button to turn on targeting, and therefore a locked mouselook instead of free-look). It's pretty hard to get the camera around front of your character (but it's entirely possible I've just overlooked something).  Skills, stats, levelling, trades... a detailed system. A wonderfully detailed system. APs (which I may mistakenly believe to mean 'action points') are granted frequently in small doses for everything from quest completion to simply levelling up your trade skills. Mousing over anything will give you a clear and detailed description of what that thing is for and what it does and what it effects - I've long desired that games did this, some do, but FE starts with this right out of the gate... they do NOT leave you in the dark (as long as you can read at a Junior High level, it's sweet).  Questing is a bit weird to get used to - the map (okay, the map... WOW... if you like detailed maps that don't hold your hand, but make some pretty obvious markers... then this map system is for you - detail, detail, detail... easily one of the most beautiful map systems I've seen in a game in a LONG time)... anyway, the map... shows a little red X on your radar that when you mouse-over it will show you the name of the quest it's for. There are no indications of distance on the radar or for quests, and some quests are a bit ambiguous (really, they just don't hold your hand there - read it... then figure it out ya lazy bums)!  Will I continue playing? You bet. What is the not free to play? Buying keys for dropped lockboxes. Unlocking your entire wardrobe. Paying for premium content (usually access to skills, timers, clothing, zones, etc) in three different monthly plans (from about $12 to $30), not so bad - but pretty steep considering you can get a great deal more out of a game like LotRO (Lord of the Rings Online) for about $15/month, with far better quality and content. Still, not too bad, save that it's comfortably on the expensive side (especially for what it is and offers).  Do I recommend it? Yes. Get past the opening stuff. Put some points into Intelligence and Perception (both of those increase your maximums for tradeskills), and READ THE QUESTS.  If you don't like reading, or actively engaging a game... this isn't for you. I, however, love reading the content in a game (I want to see what other writers and creative teams are doing with their work) and I enjoy a challenge. As such, I really enjoy this.  In short, a rocky start, some negative experience with the customer service and GMs, a bit unweildly and old-school, and expensive beyond the F2P... but a game that grows on you quickly and really eats up time (that's a mark of a good game right there).  Test it out. If you liked Fallout 2 and 3, then you'll probably enjoy this. I don't think it's a 'long term' game (as far as playability) in my books, but that's simply my own opinion and nothing more. Plenty of players are really enjoying this game, and that speaks volumes about the overall content and quality.
3087	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
5187	0	a	1 thousand hours down the drain. i could have been spreading the word of god instead and got into super heaven with all those hours i spent playing this game.

People are killing me in three â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shots', I said.     To make a long story short, If I'm gonna pay $40 for in game weapons, I had better get 40 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guns, not 1.

9064	1	a	I love Fallout. Well, I loved Fallout 3. I didnt get into the others so much but the post nuclear/disaster/world gone to â¥â¥â¥â¥ scenario called out to me. When I first stumbgled into this game in 2009 I was overjoyed that someone had the brains to bring the MMO world a new change. One that didn't invole swords or spells or people running around yelling ' you're not holding the aggro ya nooob'.  Thats what this game is. Simply put it's the best MMO I have ever played. Quite string terminology I know but let me tell you why.   Moderated help chat. This is a key in any game that people are new to and I think should be a staple in ANY MMO. The GM's are friendly but also help you when you need it.   Crafting. I have honestly never played a game with better crafting. Literally everything you can think of can be made. Want a shirt? Craft it. Need new shoes or pants? Craft them. I've heard some people say SWG had the best crafting system but I didnt play it so I cant comment.  The classless system. This in my book is a bonus. You can be whoever you want. Want a guy that beats the crap out of things with a 2x4 and shoots pistols? Thats ok. A lot of people get confused by now having a rigid class to stick to but I think its a breath of fresh air.   Ok so the graphics might be a bit outdated and theres constant bugs but the heart is there. Not many people are playing it these days but theres still enough people to make a game out of it. My only dissapointment is that Icarus studios sold it. A lot of people grumbled about the micro tranasctions but in my opinion you either buy them or you dont.  Anyways if you like fallout then I think you should enjoy this. Plus its free to play now so if you dont like it it wont cost you anything :) Its the closest to the fallout MMO your going to get for a while.

4128	0	a	This game is horrible. Even for a free game. Do not install this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥! First of all,the gameplay is awfull,the guns work like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and make no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sense,it's better to jump like a rabit around while shooting rather than taking a tactical position and controling u're recoill... The weapons don't make sense either,you start of with a g36,it's free.So that's supposed to be the worst weapon,so i purchased a AK-47 for a bunch of money,guess what...the ak sux for a lot of money --'' Secondly the hackers make me vomite. Then we have just the lame maps and ways to make money...It's all pretty boring i don't see any reason to play this game what so ever. Altough there is something well done in this game. The character creation is one of the best i've ever seen.Professional games these games even lack this,i wish skyrim had this kinda character creation. What they also did great is actually the music,it defently isn't bad at all. I don't recommend this at all,unless your a 7 year old that loves killing the time. Don't let the trailer control you,this game just sucks.

(*Repair Gun*)  To me because the game allows soo much that it has the possibility to become bigger than it already is, A new engine is coming out and possibilities are being unlocked. Don't get dragged behind, Gear up and be as awesome as you are today.  BECOME THE HERO SAN PARO DESERVES OR THE VILLIAN IT REGRETS . -Jam
8364	0	a	my older brother used to play this game ah back in the good times but eventually i got convinced to trying it immediatly i noticed it has the same frames and 10 minute loading screens from gta only the graphics are from 2006...... i wondered to myself why dont i just play gta but then i noticed the games paytowin right on the announcments theres some small sale on the paytowin â¥â¥â¥â¥ pretty dumb some reason i have friends that actually enjoy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ i dont id rather just play gta now why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are you reading this review be productive and have positive vibes man
7707	0	a	Graphics are good but its a complicated game u need 1 month or 2 to completely understand this game or complete training period.Go for dota 2,phantom recon ghost,team fortress or ghost multiplayer. ~Cheers
8510	0	a	Used to be alright, now it's â¥â¥â¥â¥
1091	1	a	It`s a good game when you play ,why,it`s very simple i know it lag a little bit but , it gives you personage customesation it`s multyplayer , have good graphics good bullet effect ... etc and i like it
3904	0	a	I played APB Reloaded when it was in beta and could only be played through G1 luancher. They banned me for no reason after +900 hours on my account and spent ~$800. Recently i've contacted them and they wouldn't even give me a proper response, only the bullshnoz generic email. â¥â¥â¥â¥ G1
3788	0	a	Played this game for a few hours. Stinks worse than hot garbage on a summers day..
2584	1	a	-=NOTE=- I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME, I'M JUST SENDING A MESSAGE ABOUT ONE PROBLEM  This is an AWESOME game, but there are SO MANY HACKERS!
10741	1	a	Really good game, shame Hi Rez ditched it though... if they start putting updates and work on it, i reckon that this game would be a hit like it was before.
781	1	a	got killed by a hacker       9/11 - would die again
4543	0	a	best loading simulater ever. -900000000000000/10 would not recomend

6036	0	a	Piece of p2w crap
948	1	a	If you want a good free game, this game is for you!!!
7578	0	a	I cant believe i even came back to this Pay To Win kind of game.   Never again.
5393	0	a	this game is for â¥â¥â¥â¥boys

3307	1	a	GTA online FTW !!!
3231	1	a	this is a fun action pack game it is hands down the best PvP game i have played on Steam.
9687	0	a	The graphics need updating MASSIVELY and the gameplay is boring. Not fun.
3668	1	a	Theres only 2 side.
10803	1	a	Best FPS since Quake. Too bad Hi-Rez ruined it.
10727	1	a	i actually have many more hours in Tribes on a different steam account, 158 more. this game is amazing, with a great community and fun, unique aspects that many shooters would benefit from trying to implement. while graphics may not be amazing, the game runs fluidly and actually looks great thanks to the ambient effects.
10325	0	a	i'd rather have a rabid bear tear my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off than play this game again
7766	0	a	Money Grubbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that don't care about updating the game to make the lag spikes go away, No they would just rather take your money and give you the middle finger. XD I'm glad my friends know how to hack the game so's to get all the perks they want .I.
5105	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
3575	1	a	Newbies need to join green districts to learn to play. Do not use the automatic join button on districts. You'll be paired with high level people if you do not follow those instructions.   Recommended if you're interested in thirdperson shooters that involve â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t lag sometimes. Engine update comes out soon. There is hope.   Premium codes are out there. The game is hella fun.
7974	0	a	Every time I run it it loads for about a hour, then crashes. Tried it multiple times, to no avail. Get the game, just to see if your system will run it.
5060	0	a	doesnt load for abou ten mins the doesnt work
7150	0	a	APB Was A Fun Game Until Getting Into The Salty Horrifying Community... Just dont get the game.
5604	0	a	Got banned for no reason Support says I got banned for 'inappropriate behavior' 10/10 400+ hrs wasted best game of the year
1169	1	a	best game to play,iam addicted
2504	1	a	this is one of the funnest copen and crim games i have ever played 
954	1	a	This is an amazing game i love it a lot far too long did i spend enjoying the caombat. Besides the occasional sniper that can 2 shot or 1 shot you most guns are balanced. sadly a lot of the guns are pay to win but im saying you still cant outplay them or beat them
5405	0	a	how can this lag......
4032	0	a	well the first time i installed it it failed and now i have to restall it sooo so far not really good :(
1197	1	a	It has something the recent Saints Row have, but infact this game is alot better.   Gets out car, car goes kamikaze and kills me, would kamikaze again. 10/10
7497	0	a	They make the game look amazing in the preview, but once you play the game it sucks, there are never any cops and never enough people to play with
2881	1	a	nice game fight
9946	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
3999	0	a	Don't believe the people who say that this isn't a pay to win game.  Someone who has played this for about 2-3 years will still fall behind someone who spent $100+ and only months (sometimes weeks) in this game. After logging in almost 500 hours in this game I can say that it does get really repetitive. I gave up around the time hackers ruled the servers. Even with this new system out I'm very hesistant to go back.  Cusomization is nice.. only if you pay for extra slots.  Seriously unless you're the trophy wife or gay secret lover of Bill Gates who will willingly give you lots of money, I don't suggest spending a dime on this.
2697	1	a	The best way i found to describe apb is that the game is a gta san andreas version,but with a huge range of customization to be done and a lot of fun.
10446	1	a	It's a great game, and requires a lot of teamwork in the late-game. But unfortunantly after it went F2P the flood of CoD 10yr olds came and destroyed it, just like every other F2P game. I love this game and will stick by my decision to thumb up it even after the disaster we might call Jarod Fogel's Basement has happened.   Now then on to the actual review.  Pros -  Introcate crafting system, it takes time and rewards patiences.  Talent system, Extremely confusing at first, but with help you can master it and create the ultimate player.  All in one style of gameplay, You are able to meld your character as you see fit, make him a Melee, or Gunslinging Dual Pistols, or even a high powered rifle.  Helpful Community, (Please keep in mind this used to be at all levels, but has receeded up into the extremely late-game due to 10yr old activites) Many players that I have met throughout my gameplay have actually given me the shirt off their back. That's right... Literally.  Cons -  10yr olds... 10yr olds EVERYWHERE!...  Minor glitches with mob pathing  Headshots don't register EVERY headshot.  And other than that I got nothing... Oh did I mention the 10yr olds swarming everywhere but the gang territories?
8123	0	a	Borind. And ugly. Not because of the game it self, but mostly cause of the players. Do not download.
2483	1	a	AWESOME GAME JUST LIKE GRAND THEFT AUTO GET IT NOW
8612	0	a	dammit how to download this thing?
5412	0	a	dont spend time on that game. full of hackers. anti cheat ban you when you get over 50 reports. this game fall into a wrong hands (GamersFirst)
10349	0	a	horable game devs worked none on this game pray that this game gets taken off steam
4250	0	a	i hate it
9699	0	a	Errr its alright. doesn't hold my attention because its a standard wow mmo
7624	0	a	It looked cool at first. A GTA like game where you could be a criminal or a vigilante cop, fighting for control of the streets. I was hugely disappointed. It has extremely little story content. There is way too much competition for missions. Say you need to kill a guy. When you find him, turns out someone else got him. This happens over and over. The missions are just instanced PVP. Thats all the game is- PVP. Yeah, I know that's the main aspect of the game, but it doesnt work. GTA mechanics are just copied, and they are much lamer. I played some GTA games before, and it gives you an adrenaline rush, speeding away from cop cars and helicopters. APB doesn't give you the same feeling. You would think that more people and another side- vigilantes- would enhance gameplay. It sorely fails.  In short, GET THE REAL GTA GAMES. Not this copy piece of crap.
7024	0	a	Not alot to do, being the cop has less things to do than the criminal but the criminal still has hardly anything. it gets repetitive its just take deliver take deliver, you can shop but thats about it erm...the events are the same mug some people kill some boss and deliver what you stole from the person you mugged.theres mailboxes to recive things but it's not that good theres chop shops and tiny missions that are all the same.  overall rating:4/10 it's okay to play every know and then but only for like 5-10 mins because it's repetetive and boring just like my complaint!!  
10002	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
8820	0	a	This game is unbalanced as f*ck!
3465	1	a	don't know why so much people whine about unfair MM, learn to aim its not harder then that, i have played 65 hours and still stomping people who is lvl 255, can do it with the first weapon to, they just don' realise how to aim and learn it.. it takes like 10 hours to understand the recoil in the game..
9201	1	a	The people who complain about the download times for this game must have pure dung beetle internet. It took less than 10 minutes for the whole game to download and in 10 minutes it's at 6% for updates...  10/10 would 10/10 will 10/10 did 10/10 waiting 10/10 dusty keyboard   Edit: 1hr and 10 minutes and it's at 49%. (In the last 3 minutes) Just jumped up to 74%. Now 100%.
2850	1	a	worth a try, it has mad customisation and the idea is pretty cool
3845	0	a	5/5 Unistall button works
1317	1	a	I do reccomend it. It is a great, fun, amazing game with nice graphics and smooth gameplay. But most importantly... It's free!
10100	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!! It's a piece of crap and poorly deisnged. It probably gets funner at higher levels but it takes forever to get there. it's a waste of space on a computer.
1399	1	a	APB Reloaded: The game that GTA online should've been.  Pros:  -Extremely active devs (Patches come out every 1-2 weeks) -Fairly decent engine although there will be an engine update soon -Plenty of things to do in the open world (Not including missions) -Missions have a nice variety -PVP is the best PVP I have ever seen on an open world game -Loads of fun ways to earn money -Notority Five is so much fun (Seriously, try it) -It IS NOT Pay to Win, I top 80% missions without having spent a single penny on the game -Customizable options for clothes and veichles is so huge you will never get every combination  Cons:  -Graphics -Armas Marketplace -Few hackers (Although situation has got better over time) -Golds playing in lower leagues  You might be wondering why so many negative reviews? This game sucks you in, gets you mugging, ram raiding and everything like that, you start to feel really good, and then BAM you get witnessed and killed. If you play your cards well, you can get plenty of money without being caught by the police.  The tutorial is absolutely fine and gives you some nice rewards if you complete the tutorial sections.  If you are fine with a dated game with absolutely fantastic gameplay; then grab this game... I can't explain how addicting this game really is.
900	1	a	One of the best games EVER played, it's like BF Hardline, World of Warcraft, GTA V, Watch Dogs and Sleeping Dogs ALL together I'd definitely recommend it. Best thing is, no matter how good you are xD even girls can kick ya a$$ out there.
2544	1	a	PVP only crime sandbox MMO. Its super imbalanced and Pay2Win but I'll be damned if it isn't fun. The best character customization in any MMO ever.
8102	0	a	The game seemed pretty decent right off the bat. Then I played a little longer and realized, it is a rushed piece of crap that should have never been released. It has potential however thats like saying Michael Jordan had potential at baseball BS he sucked at baseball. The game could have been something much better. All I am saying is that if it hadn't been rushed and it had a little bit more put into it, is that it would be a great GTA alternative or at least that's what I think             Sincerely, AnTixRushed
1902	1	a	
10529	1	a	Stay far away. The people who made this have no problem banning people for being good at the game. They will accuse paying customers of hacking and not respond to tickets. You've been warned.
2143	1	a	Ä°ts Fantastic game I playing this game 7/24 :D

5577	0	a	For some people this game laggs... More enforcers are more stronger than Criminals for some reason... Fix the car glitches/bug-just a preiared car... i touch another car and its smoking.... The aim shooting right at the body and doesn't count or shoots in an other direction... Too much rage...(on the Criminals side Of Course) Too many hackers,idiots,teamkillers... Almost a P2W-Pay2Win game.  Not even going to recommend to play this game....
7814	0	a	Terrible performance on AMD graphic cards. Lots of memory crashs and couldn't find any help in the forum for my problems. Game looks on max settings almost like on minimum due to a lack of optimization. If it runs well on your system good for you but if not invest a lot of time in trouble shooting...
2860	1	a	this game is awesome 
2243	1	a	Nice game
7127	0	a	got lost instantly 11/10 where's the anything
120	1	a	It's decent. It's free. Anything you can buy, you can earn.
8384	0	a	i cant play it at all so it suchs 
5337	0	a	Fun for a couple hours, but quickly becomes nothing but stressful.   Extremely toxic community. Less than lethal weapons used by enforcers are stressful as â¥â¥â¥â¥ to use and essentially useless unless you have sunk hundreds of hours into the game. Seems like 50-60% of the community uses snipers, so you just get â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sniped over and over. Driving controls are absolutely miserable unless you invest a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing TON of time to get a nice car, or get a pay to win car. Overall, it's just sort of pointless. There's no reason to take your rank seriously, there's no reason to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game. it's primarily a small community of veteran players and if you are new, it is impossible to get into it.   If you just want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in it with friends for a bit, go ahead. Otherwise steer clear. If you own it, just play GTAV. 
1345	1	a	The game is super annoying to begin with, Match making is beyond bad. However the customization and free roam maps are great. They helped me continue to the point where I had good items to play with the better players without constant rage.
5661	0	a	Downloaded it, clicked on the icon to play, sends me to a website that doesnt even relate to the game. 10\10
4433	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME
2454	1	a	This is like gta4 cops and robbers mode excpet you get to actually break into houses and customize your character
314	1	a	Really Nice and Good TO play
4965	0	a	BAD DRIVING NOT THAT GOOD TO CONTROL AND NOT AS GOOD AS GTA 5
6263	0	a	Dont Waste your time GTAV is better
3359	1	a	I would not recommend this game to anyone... Why can't I stop playing it? Somebody help me. (Play this game with me)
10664	1	a	Actual gameplay: 11/10 Other crap that comes with that: 0/10 This game is made by hi-rez, a company with a history of creating and abandoning their games after a couple years or so. They ditched global agenda for tribes, then ditched tribes for smite. So essentially it has gone un updated for years causing the player base to be very low and the cheaters to be somewhat common (It won't ruin the experience but you may see one every few days, just switch servers).  Conclusion: Possibly best game I have ever played, insane skillcap, insane speedcap, weapons mastery unlimited and super rewarding, but at this point its hard to start getting into it because of the lack players and dev work. Even though My steam profile doesn't say it I have played over 1000 steam hours of this (they reset when I reinstalled it) and an unknown number of hours playing it off the non steam launcher. If this series was rebooted or the game was updated I would certainly get back on it but until then ill stick to other stuff.
9439	0	a	I've put alot of time and effort into this and it's very unfortunate that I can't read because if I DID i'd be able to read the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing questlines
10091	0	a	The pictures posted are a complete lie the games so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up u require a seizure to understand whats going on and if thats not enough as i finished punching my face the â¥â¥â¥â¥ wouldnt delete properly so now i feel like ive picked up what was suposed to be a good time and been left with AIDS thanks alot
1887	1	a	There has to be 10,000+ more things to do. I started a long time ago and still havent finished, Customize Vehicles and yourself, You can pick 1 side, theres 2, Thug or Police Choose your fate, grab your gun.
7736	0	a	this game sucks, windows defender blocking .exe, u cant skip intro screen -&gt; making my brain explode because the volume is over 9000, after downloading it says wrong installation pls deinstall -&gt; i not even played this game but hell it sucks
3184	1	a	playing this until gta v comes out...
8192	0	a	THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥TTTTTTTTTTT  I â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UNISTALLED AFTER PLAYING THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ OMFG DONT DL  THIS IS A LOAD OF â¥â¥â¥â¥
6761	0	a	when i can even get this game to work its awseome but i had to make a new charter when i saved and my pc crashed 5 min after
9402	1	a	&gt;1st launch, gets in the game  &gt;Customize the character  &gt;Trying to move but I can't, noticed that the controls were distributed really weirdly  &gt;Got into the first bit of combat, couldn't kill the enemies because one of them were immortal for some reason  &gt;Died  &gt;Respawned, killed the first few enemies  &gt;Got out of the starting area  &gt;Looked over the hill on the left, tons of enemies were spawning  &gt;Went over killed a few  &gt;Others came too, murderfest started  &gt;Got killed  &gt;Respawned, got stuck  &gt;Finally got back onto the surface, got a random horse  &gt;Spawned the horse and went riding it  &gt;Found some interesting stuff and got off to check  &gt;Enemies started coming and I couldn't get back on the horse to escape(bugged)  &gt;Didn't have the gear to kill them  &gt;Got killed again  &gt;Started going on foot into a distant land, nothing appeared  &gt;Got killed again by some kind of buggy teleporting dogs in combat  &gt;Never played again  11/10 would do combat again  Seriously, this game would be really good if the devs would actually care about it I want to give a yes and a no recommendation at once, too bad I can't so I'll give a yes.
9137	0	a	Don't download unless you are willing to wait hours upon hours dowloaing it. Then waiting more hours downloading an update when you want to play.
8954	1	a	brilliant game full of hours og adventuring
3338	1	a	This game is fantastic. However it is hard for new players to get into it because of the amout of pay to win players. That does not mean quit. Just stay in a green or bronze District and get better. Pay to win players can be beat. You just have to have a large arrangement of weapons because pay to win probably only have a few guns that they use so if you find one that overpowers it then you can beat them easy. Every pay to win gun has a normal gun that can dominate it. Other than that slight problem the game is basically GTA just alot better and free.
9509	0	a	Go to de_Nuke and start apocalipse instead of this.
3183	1	a	Nice game :D
3568	1	a	I would definately recommend this game to everyone but please apb PLEASE do major updates dont disapoint your community you have lost loads of fans by that
2408	1	a	This game is oodles of fun. But don't let that mask the greediness of the people of Gamers First. Yes this game does intail all that it says. But you have to 'pay' for more then half of them. Customization, Permement and Exclusive Guns, Cash and Progression (Exp) bonuses, Car Parts, Symbol creation, and I'm sure there is lots more you will find.   Premium (Which entails Bonus Cash and EXP, Symbol/Car Customisation and... I think that's it.) costs 799 G1 credits which ammounts to 10$ US total. But that I beleive is the beta price. Because the image has a 1199 (15$ US) crossed out in the back which makes the current price a special and assuming it doesn't last until it's fully released.  Permament/Premium guns. Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake. These guns are character bound. So if you want a gun on your Criminal and Enforcer then your lookin at 120
6007	0	a	I enjoyed the look of this game, I engoyed the feel of this game. But it's marketplace is got to be the worst part of the game. I bought some clothes with in-game currency, bought ammo with in-game currency, but you have to buy weapons with real money? This is possible the best example of Pay-2-Win. Everything that does nothing but improve look is free but everything that improves combat effectiveness is must be payed for.
1716	1	a	A great game of skill, stragagy and car surfing! I highly recomend this game to anyone.
9294	0	a	This game is beyond broken
355	1	a	This game is Like GTA and Saint's Row it's a lot of fun if you like SR or GTA then you will Love APB i Recomment downloading this game and trying it out after all it is Free
5791	0	a	Just a wannabe gta:SA
3107	1	a	Really fun, more friends you play with the more fun this game can be.
1130	1	a	this is intsalled but i have yet to play it...
1259	1	a	Love this game to death. If you're a fan of GTA.. GET THIS! &lt;3
5579	0	a	Hello all, im italian but im want to give my comments in Enghish, so many people can look this comments becuse  Enghish is a international language, so take some time to read all this can help you in some way. Im start to play in 2010 when the game start, was good and cool and im play for, well im don't remember now, for 4 or 5  years. This game is become like a â¥â¥â¥â¥, is a pay to win, sometime when i was play i become angry, frustration, sad. Sometime i was play with some friend and we have good moments. I play and im know well how to play, i become so much time rank gold, i never buy weapons, and never buy in the shop. The problem of the game are this 1) Pay to win. 2) Sometime Lag. (also sometime when you drive car is uncontrollable) 3) Hacker and cheater. 4) oh my god, what is all this clothes in the shop all the time ? is like APB is become a fashion game, where people do  parade of fashion. 5) if you win the people say you are a hacker, cheater, idiot, you don't know how to play 6) if you lose, the people say you are a loser, noob, you don't know how to play 7) so community is like a cancer, everyone hates everyone 8) in my opinion administrators of game, don't care about kick cheater out the game 9) unbalanced challenges, in sever bronze you find silver, in sever silver, you find gold, how you can play if you are  silver, and you find gold player ?  listen, if you want try this game, don't try, if you play this game, and you get angry, frustration and sad, stop to play like  me. Not worth the effort play a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, if the only think can give to you is Health problems.  Marco
650	1	a	Fun but its kinda laggy and unpolished otherwise FUN
5350	0	a	If you spend enough money you can get guns that 1-3 hit kill where all non money purchaseable guns are balanced by themselves. It's Pay to Win, do not play unless you like that sort of thing
8779	0	a	game isnt actually free to play
7363	0	a	this is a good game which reminds me of the game gta . it is good but u will need to spend real mony to get permanent stuff. so i dont recommend this game at all. 
75	1	a	i hate this game so much but holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ me if i don't love it 10/10
3157	1	a	APB Reloaded is (even) great(er) to play if a) you're an elite FPS b) have a top end computer.   Since I am neither I enjoyed spectating missions, getting booted and continually and unintentionally having my vehicles blow up due to poor driving.  Highly recommended.
5808	0	a	'Oh man this game looks awso-' Got headshoted in the head by a sniper. *respawns* 'Alright! let's g-' gets a pellets from a shotgun in the back. *respawns* 'Just give me a mome-' gets blown up by a rocket launcher. *respawns* 'What the fu-' Gets ran over. *respawns*  'Ok â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gam-' Gets banned. Morale of the story: Just give up. Besides music and customizations, this game doesn't hold anything intersting. And though it seems like I don't know anything about this game in my 16 hours of gameplay, I have another 200+ gameplay hours from an older account that I played it back in 2013, and trust me, this game almost hasn't changed a bit since.
7030	0	a	I played this game  something that I Don't like it at all is Ping of the Servers it's too high and I've got so many lags 1.5 sec Dlay in Commands not good! I couldn't play any more
8389	0	a	Missions always favor the Criminals.  Crim gets to back a van into their objective? That means I HAVE TO CLIMB A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TOWER TO GET TO MY OBJECTIVE.  I have to guard an objective for 5 minutes? That means THE CRIMINALS ONLY HAVE TO TOUCH IT ONCE TO WIN.  I have to fight for half the mission against a team of snipers to get one open field objective? That means THE NEXT 3 OBJECTIVE WILL BE IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT.  I have to drive all the way across the map? That means THE CRIMINALS ARE ALREADY THERE.  The entire game is designed to benefit criminals.   DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
4292	0	a	f**k this â¥â¥â¥â¥
3321	1	a	its ok
10665	1	a	You can go fast.
4468	0	a	I have over 2 k hours on my account. Used to play and absolutely love this game. That was back in 2011 and 2012. I've stopped playing the game in 2013 because every patch the fps kept getting lower and lower. Basicly devs started working on engine upgrade to release the game on consoles and because optimisation was incompatible with upgraded engine they removed it. Or so I heard. Now in late 2013 they made a blog post saying that engine upgrade will come in Q1 of 2014 and it will improve the game visually and increase performance too. 2 years later engine upgrade still not released.  I used to get a steady 100 fps with no drops. Last I checked now my fps is 38-70. Usually arround 45-55 (even worse in Waterfront district) and it feels very unsmooth. Also at first the game used to run perfectly fine on 4 gb ram but in 2013 it started needing more ram and on 4 gb ram setups there were freezes and lags. I have upgraded to 8 gb ram. It was a day and night difference performance wise (no freezes) but this did not fix the fps issue. Since the game matchmaking is based on your skill it constatly puts you against similar skill level players. I simply got tired of losing fights even against lower skilled players simply due to the fact that my fps is unsmooth and keeps jumping. Got tired of waiting for an engine upgrade that is never released. Unless you have a i7 oc'ed to 4.5 GHz I do not recommend playing this game. Sure its doable at bronze and silver levels but once you hit gold threat all your fun will go away when you try to kill somebody with 144 fps on his i100 and 1000 gb of ram. Random server-side lag and teleportations do not help either.  Oh and back in 2013 EU1 had ~3000 active players and EU2 had ~1700. Now they merged EU servers together active population is even less of that that EU2 used ot have so the population speaks for itself. Perhaps in 2050 when Half - Life 3 is released and APB Reloaded receives it's engine upgrade I will remove this negative review and start enjoying the game again because right now it's impossible to do so.
10470	1	a	Great game! (7/10) Controls are a bit confusing...
6612	0	a	this game is straight up meth. hooks you in to the game. yet the game itself isn't good in anyway.   if your enemy has a better gun, your dead. how to win fights with equals, jump,crouch, act like a madman with a gun.  oh you want to know about the cars? well you can literally blow up a car by running into it with yours if it's fast enough. unavoidable death to teh opposing side. you can't shoot trough windows. takes forever to blow up teh car (unless you got a real money bought weapon) , which the driver gets a notification 10 full seconds before. unless ofcourse you got a rocket launcher. which insta kills anything, you can't really miss. and if you don't have a payed for gun. don't even think about shooting at a guy with a launcher. he will turn around and set you flying off better than north koreas rocket program.  oh you want guns? well you either buy it again every 10 days or you pay real money for it. even up to 40$. not even kidding.  only the basic concept of the game is good. but the game is literally designed to minimize skill out of the game. thus having better guns be an absolute grindfiest to get. or you pay for it. in real money.  only 2 good things, the character creation is actually quite good, but since it allows you to change your height, there is absolutetly no headshot dmg multiplier of sorts. hit him anywhere adn the same dmg is applie.  and for the otehr ofcourse the uninstall process. this game is horrible.
10346	1	a	Great Game! Lots of story, gameplay, and awesome players who will help you out along the way! I wish there were a few more options to reduce lag though.
8202	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
9161	1	a	This game is excellent. It was my first online game to play and though I dont play enough i think it is a great way to be introduced to online gaming. Sadly their are some bugs and problems with lag but these are only minor. Try this game and i am sure you will like!
3862	0	a	Cheater and Lags, nothing more to say
4502	0	a	This game is terrible even for new players it has hackers,pay2win guns,unbalance match making,horrible gameplay and alot of glitches that admins ignores
4744	0	a	nothing change
10371	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥. dont bother.
3138	1	a	nice game now with the anti hackor cheat system
9052	1	a	This game is awesome. It is a great play if you're willing to put some hours into it.
9436	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
1413	1	a	GTA V free ALOT OF CUSTOMIZATION 9/10
1212	1	a	If you dont like the game because of hackers, become a hacker.
1672	1	a	Is Very Gud Game!
904	1	a	awesome game i came back to it after i started to hate it for community 2 years ago. its good to be back on the streets of san paro wastin everybody :D i recommend this game for everyone who is looking for an amazing free multiplayer experience! on a note for all gpu maxers do not use vsync and framerate smoothing together or you will have heavy mouse and keyboard input lag!
6835	0	a	this game is not working for me at all
6248	0	a	the server is very lag!
6493	0	a	Best example of a pay-to-win I have ever witnessed.
5502	0	a	This game is a play for free, pay to win. There for it is terrible this game wants to be gta online but has terrible realism and pyshics. Also in this game as it is openworld pvp if you shoot someone they will not die, even if the gun is 50 calibre it will take more than 15 bullets. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
6739	0	a	Honestly I love the idea of this game, it is a GREAT idea. I think, however, that it was poorly executed in many ways (displaying the single point to which you have to drive a slow, paper-armored car to the people whose job it was to blow up the car comes to mind, as well as the hitboxes which mean you were never REALLY behind cover).  Also word on the grapevine is that it's currently buggy beyond reason.  All this is a bloody pity because it had HUGE promise.
9618	1	a	Very fun mmo!! fun fallout feel. would reccomend this to anyone that has 3000 hours to spare :)
9216	0	a	i can't believe people still play this !
5727	0	a	too much pay to win
85	1	a	APB is back and now Free-to-Play! If you like the idea of a massively multiplayer GTA or more specifically Crackdown, then you'll love APB. The character customization is by far the most DETAILED and INSANE that I've ever seen, and me likey.
5049	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
3381	1	a	My review for APB Reloaded: Pros: Great game,I play it everytime and now im used to it. Massively Multiplayer which I like. Even though I dont like third person shooters,I still love it's gun physics. The game is stable which makes my computer totally crash. Has alot of things to do which I also like personnaly since there will be alot of playing and lots of fun too.  Cons: This game has HORRIBLE matchmaking. Game has too many bugs and glitches (espacially the wardrobe one.) Has too many hackers and Gamersfirst isnt doing anything about it. Game is p2w which I spent 50$ on just a rly bad gun. Chat has too many bad stuff and annoying people which I hate.  My rating: 8/10.Great job Gamersfirst.
544	1	a	I played it for around 800 hours and I love and hate it at the same time.    10/10 - I want to rage quit again. &lt;3
524	1	a	Gets on, gets hit by a car driven by a little kid, flys across the sky, dies, gets tbaged, spends $5 on ammo..  - 11/10 Would waste more time and real $ to play again.
3830	0	a	This review is based on my many years playing this game, from the very beginning of RTW Closed beta til now. And the info that has been collected from time spent on forums/APB Blog.  There was a time when this was my favorite game, and pretty much all i played most of the time. But as time have passed, i'm realizing that the company that bought this game from RTW either gives no â¥â¥â¥â¥s, or are just too incompetent to improve it.  There hasn't been a proper content update for years, all they do is release reskins of already exisitng guns. And if we're lucky, we get an unreleased gun that RTW didn't finish back in 2010. The excuse for the last few years has been the engine upgrade, which might just be in development by 2 people at this point, since they've fired everyone who created the game.  Then there is the forums, one of the few places you could attempt to get some answers from G1. That is if you don't get your thread deleted within minutes, because it asks questions that G1 does not wish to answer. Their solutions to controversy seems to be to just delete any evidence of it, and pretend that everything is perfect in little ol' APB town. But the worst part is that the game is no longer competetive on the global market. Several games blows this game out of the water the second we start talking about gameplay, and really all that this game has got going for it anymore is the customization. You can truly make anything you want, except not anything you want, since G1 has stated several times that they will ban creators of offensive/sexual content, even though it's an 18+ game, and also 2016 guys, seriously.  Pros: + Gameplay (by Original Developers Real Time Worlds) + Customization (very extensive, truly one of the best ever) + Something for both the casual and competetive gamers. (Very random and fun game, but also very skill based) + Might aswell say the game that RTW made, cause this game is fundamentally really good.  Cons:   - Optimization is â¥â¥â¥â¥. - Utterly dead development wise - Terrible forum management - Gun releases (OP at first to promote sales, then nerfed when bought by players) - Constant Armas Releases (pointless reskins), and nothing else. - The incompetence of the current owners. (G1)
10562	1	a	This was my first MMOFPS and i loved every second of it. A high recommendation for those who like large battles on moderately-large scales.
3501	1	a	This game has Loads to do! but also has a bland map but makes up with all the stuff you can do :)
5591	0	a	the type of game where they charge stupid prices for the good stuff
5165	0	a	PAY TO WIN..... SUCKS.... WORST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED.... COPS SPAWN CAMPING WITH GUNS THAT CAN 2 SHOT YOU OR CARS....
99	1	a	It's an awesome game, best played with friends i really like it to be honest. It's not that bad
3982	0	a	I thought it wasn't any good out of ten i would give it a 1 because you have to make a account first. Plus it is saints row but rubbish so my opinion is just get GTA or Saints row, they are better because APB is cheap you can't do half the things you can in GTA.PLease don't get it. this is my experience and you would know what I mean.
5870	0	a	The connection is awful
3043	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME  
6529	0	a	Pay to win? Pay to customize yoursef? Pay to customize your car? Pay for more decals on your car? Pay for more weapons? Pay for more damage?   Hell, Its basically a pay to play game.
6692	0	a	Pay to play garbage. I hope you like renting weapons, because that's all you're going to get to do unless you drop real cash. The combat is third person awkward and boreing.
114	1	a	Only PandaFeces plays this trash game.
2200	1	a	Gameplay is so-so, not bad, not the best. However! The Level of customazation is immense! Character, symbol, and cars can be changed to look EXsactly as you like.
6905	0	a	pay2win game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
797	1	a	1/10 Would not load again.
7123	0	a	10/10 would donate a small loan of a million â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4605	0	a	Very bad experience wth this game: Launching this game messes up the whole steam client. Even after i close the game steam still shows it running in my status and everything else, now one would think as to restart the client to fix this but steam does not exit when a game is running, so it keeps requesting me to close the game first before exiting while it is already closed!(Also,you cannot launch the game again as it is already running according to steam)...sticky situation xD. then i have to use the task manager to manually terminate all steam processes and start steam again. Pretty tedious right? and this was just a single issue out of the many this game brings to the system. I could write about more issues but it would make this review too long, so in conclusion: very bad personal experince=would not recommend to anyone.
4211	0	a	If you play this game without pay RIP or rather Rest In Grinding. Unless you pay for this game, you will find yourself grinding hour after hour. The customization is horrible if you are not a premium player. You should probably not play this game if your going to not play as a premium player. It was fun while it lasted. RIP APB and RIG all non prem players.
5461	0	a	Tried to be gta, failed.
7915	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
3426	1	a	Its fun. You shouldn't expect very good graphics nor very good car control. The mission system is fun though its not perfect - still some things to improve. Also this finally gets its engine update. But well.  Been playing this for 800+ hours and over a long time period. Paused once but then came back. Also spent lots of money in it. Shortly before the engine update it finally happens, I get banned for some reason, haven't been told a reason why when contacting the support either. Sorry but that is bull_sh.it. If I get banned for whatever reason, it should be my right to at least know what I have done wrong. Besides that, the game is fine and fun and eats your time. But you shouldn't expect a graphical marvel.
8149	0	a	I'm playing on a 2500 dollar game rig that was built within the last 6 months. With my setup this game plays for â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can barely get 20 fps during combat. Customisation is amasing, though. I hear it's p2w, but I can't confirm as I can't really play it.
2916	1	a	APB is an amazing urban fashion digital dressing room with some ok shooting and driving bits tacked on. Quite possibly the best avatar customization tech ever seen in any online game and worth checking out for that alone.
7284	0	a	Cool game with interesting ideas held back by lag and hackers. Decided to log on after a couple of years to see if things have improved. Chat full of complaints of lag as everything stops to be followed by everyone immediately driving into a wall. Dealt with it awhile to give it a chance because there is a lot of really cool stuff in this game. I finally got into a mission and was immediately killed by a player jumping and spinning snapping to and dropping anyone within line of site. Immediately uninstalled. Would be a worthwhile game if you didn't have to deal with P2WIN, LAG, and HACKERS.
7430	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
3279	1	a	This game is pure and insane fun. Imagine GTA. Multiply it several times. Total Chaos and Havoc everywhere. Two factions with clear focus on PvP action. Matchmaking is fluid and intuitive. Give it a shot, it's free.
2743	1	a	To actually permanently buy an item you have to pay an extreme amount of in-game cash. Besides that it is fun. 3/5
1925	1	a	Great free 3rd person shooter. Community isn't the best in my opinion, but still tons of fun, especially with friends!
7593	0	a	This game is run by Gamersfirst, which should be named GamersLast.  It bans ppl for no reason and take away G1C. Worst part is, you can't do anything about. There used to a place where you can submit a ticket and complain, but they removed that....  SO bottom line.... if you play this game, and get to a higher level...you should expect to get banned like legit gamers like us.  Don't waste your time and money on Gamersfirst...
8550	0	a	This game needs a lot of improvements, it's laggy, combat is old, and it's dead, no players play anymore :D But this game is cool and can be improved, and full customization bring BIG UP :D but i can't recommend it until it will be improved, i'll change my review if it will be updated.
2437	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
651	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâs new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010âs deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâs devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâs missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâs problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
1504	1	a	I would recommend this game but can you pleae fix the god dang launcher its not working on steam i had to go all the way to go to extra time to go onto gamersfirst live again to get the proper launcher to play :/
972	1	a	Recommended, ONLY if you got good to Great Internet speed and Good to Great amount of RAM.
892	1	a	This game is very hard to eat and play at the same time! Be warned.
6095	0	a	Me:*Sees an open-world crime simulator* Looks fun. Download it Install it Load up the game (Which took about a half hour) Watch intro video Join a sever ('Nother half hour) Aimlessly walk around for ten minutes Get banned for no reason. (Said 'Banned: Missing [Something like] 3cj8p.j) 10/10 IGN 'Would get banned again.'
323	1	a	Amazing game.  This game is like the old version of saints row 2 meets GTA Online and a whole â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of crack (and stealing)
1412	1	a	A really good game with lots of customisation options, really fun to play with friends, it gets patched alot and the devs fix alot of bugs. The only 'big' problem of this game is the server lag that can sometimes annoy you and make you rage quit, but all in all its a really fun game :)
2374	1	a	it is fun 
6619	0	a	Freaking stupid makes my profile say im in the game but im not thisgame sucks
3400	1	a	It's pretty much the biggest Pay to Win game out there. Is it fun? With friends, Hell yeah!
1177	1	a	This game is great playing with friends and other people, but is very boring when it comes to single player standards.  8/10.
1235	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
7234	0	a	Its â¥â¥â¥â¥, dont get it its not worth the space
10650	1	a	I wish people played this game :C
4645	0	a	I thought I would give this game another try right. thinking it can't be that bad right? well with in 10mins of gameplay I remembered why I stopped in the first place. This game is total â¥â¥â¥â¥, I think I'll just wait for GTA V.
5858	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can get banned for nothing Dont waste your time
2678	1	a	It's pretty good. There's no harm in getting it, so if you're curious try it out.  However, be wary of snipers.
3	1	a	Hiya, I've played this game for a little bit now, and here is some of the reasons for me playing such an ungodly amount of time on this game APB reloaded.   1. This game is a competitive fast paced game that makes you think or die(in-game, can't speak for strokes.) I personally greatly enjoy out thinking my opponents in 1v1-3 fights. The P2W elements doesn't exist. And. the few exceptions with guns on armas(real cash store online) have usually been balanced in a couple of months.  2. Now for some of the cons, laaaaaaggggg. If you don't have a good computer your frames will be 20 fps or worst which will cap how well you can do. Not to mention the servers lag spikes that happen occasionally. Now lets deal with the hacking element. Hackers are rare. I usually see 1-3 blatant hackers per month. I.E. teleporting with a light machine gun(shaw) shooting my car as I (unsuccessfully) escape. ahhhhh the memories. They are usually banned real quick. But, there are more subtle hackes like aimbot and small speed increase that seemingly take longer to ban.   3. Now my raging is out lets focus on the positives. Designing is almost unlimited to your clothes, car , and even the music theme you victims hear when you kill them. There is a design cap for f2p players (like 4 symbols per clothing piece) but G1(the company that owns the game) is pretty good at reguler events that you can win subscription for 3 days or so. So design your heart out! Playing with friends or making friends in game and playing with them is alot of fun, win together and rage together.   4. As I referenced above G1 does holiday and sometimes random events where you can win subscription for a few days, guns, g1 coin(real cash money), or joker tickets....ect ect. I've actually collected enough g1 coins from events to unlock 2 guns permanent for account when they were 50% off. The events themselves are generally fun and different than normal missions. Like the holloween event :).  5. The community, one controversal topic. The general population of apb are usually not jerks (to put mildly), but it can be toxic, and if you don't have some tolerance for idiots you will rage alot. My best advice for handling the community is to have a friend to show off how stupid they can be at times. That is not to say there is no 'good-guys(or gals)' in-game. I have interacted with my fair share of friendly players and (rarely) people I now call friends.   6. This game can be brutal to new players starting. There are many veteran players who will decimate anyone they can heartlessly(sniff sniff). So If your thinking of starting out I cannot emphasis this enough. Stick...to...bronze...districts...........,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.....................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,............................... The game has a threat system. Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Based on how good you do, and there are bronze, silver, ect districts you enter where people are the same threat level(skill level) as you are. Good system right? Not so much. The game allows you to enter a district that is one threat level below you. So all the golds (veterans) are in silver disctrict. So silvers and bronzes go to bronze if you want to play against players your skill level and get better(As I did. I spent over half my play time on bronze till I got better and went from silver to gold) Go to disctrict select, go to advanced selecter on the top left, go to a bronze district and hopefully not rage as much. So whenever you are silver go to bronze best advice I can give.  7. The game is a gem of a F2P game and I haven't seen one like it ever. There is alot more details in the game but I think that covers the gist of it. So, I would recomend you to try it. Worst happens you don't like it nothing lost but time, or like me, you can find a game that is alot of fun.   So in closing of this review, thanks for reading it(or skiping to the bottem of the review) Have a good day :)  Firestorm
8747	0	a	This is everything wrong with free to play games
10273	1	a	Pretty fun, and different. Cheaply made models for some things, and some odd bugs, controls are confusing but it's.. alright?  7/10
6733	0	a	I did not enjoy my time with APB Reloaded  It was a great consept for a game but it had not only been done before but better  Pros: -Charater custamizion is very good and lots of diffrent thing to choose  -Meuns are nice -the ablity to create your own custom decals and put them on cars and your chartars cloths is nice  Cons:  -The city feels empty with little to no people walking around -The city is grey and not colour full  -the only place that is colour full in the game is the 'mall' where you buys cloths and such -the game play is boring -ALL the cars handle like â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Mission Spawn system is broken and can lead to many spawn kills  -Mission arent that uniqe or fun  And this part needs its own place this game is complety PAY TO WIN you get all the best guns in the game by paying real money so basicly one guy will come buy every thing and destory EVERY ONE who is free to play   So I did not like ABP Reload once again the concept was good but had been done before and better is they wanted to base there game off of a good version of there concept they should have gone with gopham city imposters as that game was colour full, fun and did this concpet very very well so unless your willing to shell out a bunch of moeny i would not recommend
1386	1	a	APB is a better GTA. Ton of customization from your toon to your car. Its very addictive. Dont lissen to the trolls on here. Sure you can buy guns for real cash but what ftp dont have that. but keep in mind the noob starting gun is just as good as a $40 cash gun. Its about your skill no the gun.   I have to admit that there is a lot of trolls. A lot of players talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game on the fourms but yet they are playing the game 7 days a week. If the game is soooo bad then why do they keep playing it?   For me this game gets a 8/10 Great customization, Great over the shoulder FPS action.
10699	1	a	One of the first games i played on Steam, and I sure have some great memories of it. Been a long time since i played it, but from what i remember it was awesome(at that time), don't knw why i'm writing this now though.
9873	1	a	Very similar to Planet Calypso without the real money economy, space travel and a more Fallout 3 setting. However for a Free to Play game it's great and if I didn't already play Planet Calypso I would be playing this!
4327	0	a	Not bad but its p2w
6881	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.

5243	0	a	Its a lot worse than the trailer makes it look its actually really â¥â¥â¥â¥
8837	0	a	A game with great potential ruined by a negligent company and microtransactions. Very addictive, I caved into the microtransactions hard, but eventual realized the endless pit I was throwing money into and decided to stop playing entirely. Not worth anyone's time.
2324	1	a	Hit the streets as a licensed vigilante or hardened criminal in the crime-ravaged metropolis of San Paro where shootouts, car-chases, robbery, and vandalism are all in a day's work. Prove yourself to your chosen organization and you could earn fame, deadly weapons, exotic vehicles, and stylish new clothing; fail.But is too cool
3003	1	a	cant recommend because i couldnt get it running ?/10
973	1	a	i love this game too bad my laptop is too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and cant play it smoothly 7/10
9751	1	a	Free verison of FallOut 3! Its awesome. :)
3374	1	a	It's a very good game. I just hope they keep adding new updates to it with more variety of clothes.
10600	1	a	This game looks cool!
6926	0	a	It's mostly pay to win. Sure it may be free but it is absolutely terrible.
10755	1	a	Cool.. needs to update.
6374	0	a	Filled with brazilian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and a poor quality engine poor support and lack of diversity dont bother with it
8275	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again
2477	1	a	Awesome Game :P
7810	0	a	Gold players in bronze distric lots of bugs.. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
9418	1	a	Loads of content for a free-to-play MMO. Some of the game play can be a bit grinding, but the crafting is rich with variety.
7328	0	a	Truely awful. You will just die, and die, and die by simply overpowered players that have put their money into the grind machine to quickly unlock the best possible weapons that will one shot you before you can blink. No tutorial that I noticed, and no match making, just thrown into a mess. Appalling game.
9993	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
604	1	a	In order to be really good, you need to spend lots of money
3265	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
3632	1	a	Good game, but my wallet crying :--(
410	1	a	The community can be a bummer since it is filled with ragers :/  There used to be a lot of hackers but since G1 made a anticheat system there's not many left.  I recommend this game to people who likes Shooter games (But not FPS)
3559	1	a	.
4727	0	a	It was good at first but the pay to win has become so extreme that you don't want to play after getting you're a â¥â¥â¥ beat because u you don't want to put 10-100 bucks into a free to play. So I guess if you like a pay-TV - win cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥ with cool customization that takes for ever to unlock... this is he game for you
5538	0	a	  This is the perfect game if your standards are low or when your life isn't worth anything to you anymore
10339	1	a	Meh i played worst but its ok
3560	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
3260	1	a	I think this is a quite enjoyable multiplayer game. It's especially fun when you have friends do do it with, as there are missoins to complete in-game and a nice, fun free-roam outside of the missions
4183	0	a	I'm so glad to see people agree with me. Let me just give you guys my opinion on this sad little potential wasted game. On the outside, this game looks pretty good. It's true, you get to customize your character, do some fun things around the city and play games in teams with different objectives. Sounds good right? Nope. This game will constantly pester you to become a 'premium member', and if you do that, you get more money in game, and even get things like more tattoos. Premium members can have up to 50 tattoos. Guess how many normal players get? 3. THREE. And even if you do pay for premium, there are still other things you have to pay real money for if you want to enjoy the game, for instance, guns. The most important thing in this game. You'll find the guns you are given to start off are awful, but fair enough. You can buy guns with ingame money and 'joker tickets', which are a pain to get hold of, and the gun expires in 7 days after you've bought it, so you'll have to collect the funds to buy it again! You could buy guns with real life money of course, which are overpowered and very expensive. I thought this game is decent enough to maybe pay a little more, so I decided to check out the store. I found this gun I liked for Â£5. I thought, maybe as a one off. Then I looked and it said I'd only have it for 30 days. There IS an option to keep the gun forever, but guess how much that would be? Â£25! You could buy a whole new, better game out of that! And this is just for 1 gun, out of the wide variety of guns you can get. And the thing is, this game is not 'OUTSTANDING'. It seems like it could be a decent game, fairly fun (if you weren't getting constantly killed by those who do buy over powered gun), and worth playing, and maybe paying a little for. But it's just ridiculous how much you'd have to pay if you wanted to have a good time with this disappointment. Thank god GTA 5 and GTA Online is coming to PC.
3552	1	a	Played it since its first beta before official launching, best costumization i have ever seen. Tons of fun with clanmates or friends.  will keep you busy for awhile.
9938	1	a	Just another boring old MMO right? WRONG!! This game is absolutely uh not that addictive tho but it is decent.The most decent game I had ever played.The game started in a wasteland where you are a clone.If you had played Fallout before then the game is a bit similar to this except this is an MMO.The game is really fun to play with especially the blood sport.The blood sport is a PVP arena where you play Team DeathMatch,Capture the Flag and so on.The best part is this game is not I repeat NOT PAY 2 WIN!! You can basically get anything you want in this game using the in-game currency which is 'chips'.The community is really helpful and not annoying at all.If you need any help in the game you should just ask in the chat and one of the members will help you out.They are all friendly in the game.This game deserve 7/10
1666	1	a	This game is something like GTA but Customizable character,,, I Like that :)
5513	0	a	The thing i hate in this game is that I'm getting killed all the time by Pay to Win players. It makes game unplayable.
8271	0	a	Copy of GTA, no very good.
4812	0	a	Loading simulator,10/10 would get kicked for no reason again.
6067	0	a	It's hard to really express how bad this is. Let's create a scenario: You just got in the game. You get a basic rifle and pistol. The game does little to tell you what to do and where to go. Instantly, other players murder you, because you're on a mission and all of APB is PVP. You finally figure out what to do.  Know what you find? You find the most boring weapon physics ever created. You find that elite items make all the difference between win and lose. You find a player base of suburban kids that love 'gang banging' vs. Neckbeard cop wannabes that drop money on elite items. This is GTA without the fun and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ player names attached to an even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier player base.   Skip on this one for your sake. Just get Saint's Row 3.
7331	0	a	How do you play a game so rife with hackers and no regulatory system with regards to it? That negative point is enought to drown out almost all the positiveness in the game.
3485	1	a	Well, i can say this is really good. The texture, maps, yeah it's all great. Although it doesn't run well on my Acer laptop :)
1095	1	a	Its pretty much a free version of GTA V if your too poor to afford GTA V  My first day.. Walk out of the Station...see three pimped out Super cars drag racing down the street...one hits a car, flips over, and exploads... Me: I think I'm gona like this game!  Second Day... Walk out of the Station...See a pimped out van driving down the streets with 2 guys hanging out the sides unloading their weapons into whoever is chaseing them...Whos chasing them? two pimped out Super cars with sirens blaring...one hit a car, flips over and explodes... Me: Yep...I'm definitly gona like this game...
5780	0	a	trying ot get it to work the struggle is real
9948	1	a	FANTASTIC game!! GREAT graphics and gameplay!!! Whether you want to craft, farm and harvest, or blast your way through endless mutants, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! Vehicles, weapons and armor, camps and farms...you name it, you can craft it!! The storyline is good, and just the gameplay itself is worth it!!! I would recommend this game to anyone...you wont be disappointed!!!!
6993	0	a	This game is absolute disaster, it had multiple years to fix it. But it did squat but make p2w weaponry. This game is not worth it, PRERIOD.
6383	0	a	very bad game!! much P2W!!
2059	1	a	Weird, buggy, can be fun at times, but again, like alot of games like this, you get alil outclassed by those players who play all the time.   give it a try, still a fun game, I personally just don't think it's a game that your gonna play all the time.

10642	1	a	This is by far the best fps game ive ever played. There are tons of different gamemodes that are great, and you can choose from different vehicles. I for 1 feel like this game would destroy all others i &lt;3 tribes ascend and there are lots of classes to choose from and that i will not tell you... why are you still reading reviews? PLAY THIS EPIC GAME!!!!!!!
662	1	a	From the first 10 minutes of playing, I knew I'd love this game
7760	0	a	unless you like pay 2 win this may not be the game for you
9904	1	a	this game is just like fallout
6208	0	a	FPS drop im have very Cool PC
1991	1	a	This game is one of the best open-world games out there. It is often compared to GTA, but it is so much more than that. It has fully customizable characters and cars, big open-world map, and a social district completely for your customization needs. This game is way better than the way the people on here are making it out to be. It's free, so give it a try. You don't like it, your loss.
4970	0	a	I have played APB for a short time, when I first started playing I got gold my first day, I was having fun, but as soon as you hit high ranked servers, you're dead, the game is no longer fun because you can't kill cheaters, or people who are just too good at the game and should stop playing it.   APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change. Change what the community wants you to change.  Will NOT play again. 3/10
5341	0	a	no, DON'T! Please don't waste your time playing this game. This game is crap, not much people in servers and lots of servers have hackers or annoying players. Gameplay used to be fun and this game had good potential. Not anymore. This game is horrible. Don't spend a cent on their crappy DLC too!   I will leave by giving a nice gift to the developers:   .â¦â¦..â¦../Â´?/)â¦â¦â¦â¦..(\?`\ â¦â¦â¦â¦/â¦.//â¦â¦â¦.. â¦\â¦.\ â¦â¦â¦../â¦.//â¦â¦â¦â¦ â¦.\â¦.\ â¦../Â´?/â¦./Â´?\â¦â¦â¦â¦../? `\â¦.\?`\ .././â¦/â¦./â¦./.|_â¦â¦_| .\â¦.\â¦.\â¦..\ (.(â¦.(â¦.(â¦./.)..)â¦..(..(. \â¦.)â¦.)â¦.).) .\â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.\/â¦/â¦....\/â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦./ ..\â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. /â¦â¦..\â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦/ â¦.\â¦â¦â¦â¦..(â¦â¦â¦..)â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦/ there, happy?
10565	1	a	THIS WAS THE BEST GAME EVER FOR ME.  THEN SMITE HAPPENED...  HI-REZ ABANDONED THIS MASTERPIECE FOR THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME CALLED SMITE...  BUT NOW IT IS THEIR BEST DECISION TO SUPPORT THIS AWESOME GAME!
9422	0	a	I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me.   I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.
316	1	a	its an amazing experience.
10004	1	a	A decent post-apocalyptic MMO with a deep crafting system and a lot of content. Not really pay-to-win either. Definitely worth a try if the genre appeals to you or you want an MMO with something a little different to offer.
10133	1	a	dont play this it sucks
273	1	a	Spent a lot of money on it, then GTA V came out and this game died... It was fun while it lasted. Most customization ive ever seen in a game.
5431	0	a	The thing i hate in this game is that I'm getting killed all the time by Pay to Win players. It makes game unplayable.
9041	1	a	Before I start, let me say, yes this game isn't as good as it could be!  But it could be worse. To start, some of the major flaws are visable from the get go, lack of character slots, you want more then one character, buy slots, this itself is a huge turn off, and makes it seem like a demo for a pay once to play MMO. This honestly detered me from playing, but I decided to press on to see if it got better, and it did.....some what. While the skill system takes a moment to learn due to it's unfreindly new user interface, it's well designed once you get the hang of how it works.  The crafting systemis superb, while it is long, and a lot of the crafting times are broken, meaning they take more or less then what it says it will, only those who are really in to crafting will actually make use of this. All crafting skills have purpose, if you seek to play a more support role, medical and cooking skills will be of the most use to you. want a role to inflict maximum damage, science, ballistics and possibly nature (whick could also be put under support) would be a good suit for you. You can buy slots to have the ability to craft multiple items at once, and buy a device to speed up the crafting times all together. What more, the device can be bought from other players in game.  The ability to create camps, and material generaters gives this mmo a unique feel to it, making it seem more like a sand box game then an mmo. But this is also it's downfall, because it seem it can't decide if it wants to be an MMO or sandbox game, the AI seems unfinished and buggy, audio clips break at times, and enemy AI is flat out broken. But the broken enemy AI may also have been done on purpose, as even something one or two levels higher then you can easily come close to killing you, if you're not swarmed that is. Therefor, it's better to travel out in teams so you're not caught in a fray alone. Yes this game is Pay to Win, yes it has a lot of bugs and could be considered still in beta, but this game has merit, and tried to do something different.  If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8/10 something worth keeping regaurdless of the playerbase or cons, as this game could be easily fixed.
5964	0	a	not for low grade computers
1792	1	a	Alright as far as i see APB Reloaded its a really fun game...the only thing I think everyone who wants to play this game should know before they join is that there is going to be a lot of haters and people who get mad easily, all I suggest for this really is to ignore them and continue on playing because games are meant to be fun not stress alright...that's just my opinion. :3
5724	0	a	My happiest moments when playing this game were the first time I installed it and the last time I uninstalled it.
1450	1	a	APB Is a game with endless thought of makeing cars, people ect. The only thing crappy about the game is the lag i cant stand lag but i get used to it everthing else is perfect! 11/10
9275	0	a	Another game that isn't made for Steam and should NOT be on Steam. Comes with it's own launcher with the most excrement like interface.  Requires account to be made.  Had only to jump through 100 hoops before I could play: Open with Steam -&gt; launcher -&gt; create account -&gt; opens website -&gt; create account -&gt; launcher login -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; luncher checks local content just downloaded with steam -&gt; launcher downloads updates (although I just downloaded it from Steam) -&gt; open with steam -&gt; login with launcher -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; check for updates -&gt; play  Horrendous movement, poor graphics, very very very unintuitive.   Couldn't make it past the first quest, so bad...
53	1	a	The game itself is good, open-world. You can create your character, customize it, choose to be the Enforcers or Criminals. You can customize your car, your clothes, your stats, weapons, etc...   The bad parts: ALERT* Toxic and bad community, 80% Hackers. Fairfight's ban's everywhere... ** Random server lags or server going down. *** Very unbalanced matchmaking **** Pay2Win but still you can get your items, but requires alot of time, luck? and skill?  Well... The game is still fun to play with your friends so... 6/10
9692	0	a	I fully do not recommend this game. For the past six hours I've been trying to get this game to update past 2.35 and every time the game will pop up with a fatal error or the program will stop responding. I've posted on their Facebook whats going on, I'm not the only one who has been having this problem and no one will answer us about it. Other then that part the game looks pretty interesting but good luck actually getting it to run
9485	1	a	Um this game is just plain weird
2525	1	a	A great game with alot of good weps and armor, Alot of players enjoy playing this BUT there are too much wall glitchers which stay there and kill people as a bounty. This game is A bit of PTW (Pay To Win) Needs to add Good snipers with Ingame money.  But as always, i love this game, it is so much fun, enjoy.
8203	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.
3827	0	a	The thing about this game is that the company that runs it either doesn't care or is just terrible at taking care of it. As said in previous reviews, if you are not lagging so terribly that you wish your own Mother would murder you, then you're being disconnected from the servers. If it's not the lag that drives you away, then it is most certainly the community of players in the game. There is little to no respect whatsoever among players, and even less for the game itself. This game is riddled with hackers and cheaters. Some may say that this game is highly 'Pay-2-win', although that's not always the truth. However, if you choose to pay for in-game items, be willing to pay quite a bit.   Having said that, I think that in the right hands, this game is the best Free to Play game available. I still play it in hopes that maybe things will get better, but I guess I should know better by now.
8196	0	a	thank you it say im play the game whem i arent and i cant uninstall it or play a different game
10307	1	a	YEP, this game made me love knives EVEN MORE!!!! GET IT DAMNIT!!!

8377	0	a	Can't even load the game 0/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pile of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
4156	0	a	APB has got to be the worst free to play game out there! it doesn't use any antihacking programs and most of it's players have a bad attitude! It's a pay to win game, wich means they ripoff their players because they don't stop the hackers, wich means people who pay for ingame guns to be better really arent because there are hackers everywhere! When you join a mission you will either get kicked from it by the leader coz of your low rank or your team mates will kill you to annoy you, then when you get enemies they will kick you. it's a horrible game to play, it only causes stress! 0/10 from me, i uninstalled it because i hate the attitude of its players. (Games are suposed do be fun and enjoyable).
6807	0	a	havent been able to play because of lags and crashes 1/10
7273	0	a	I spawned in awaiting a brief tutorial describeing the mechanics and functions of the game and just basic need to know information. what I got was a room with two other playes and a quest log. I steeped out side to take a look at the world and was imedeately hit by what I assume was a rocket laucher. After I respawned I went to take another look and was imeadeately rundown by a player in a car. After all this I still understand whats going on........what is life?
3211	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥o 
440	1	a	Its OK
6092	0	a	Game gives me an overdose of cancer
9057	0	a	Couldn't even get into the game due to a very broken sign in system.
4340	0	a	Spent three hours in a mock demolition derby and poledancing on top of other people's cars, paid off cops who pulled me over for speeding with a safe full of diamonds I'd just stolen right in front of them, 20/10 would play again.   To be honest, 9.5/10 people who try to play APB are going to be slavering at the jaws with rage within 15 minutes of entering their first server. The game is heavilly PvP orientated... Unfortunately, the PvP is weighted heavilly in favor of anyone who pays exorbant sums of money for the best gear. Not to mention the highly experienced, well-geared high levels that come to the starting areas to murder new players.   In terms of concept and general gameplay, APB is a wonderful game. Imagine an MMO version of Saints Row or GTA, with players being both criminals and cops. That's the general idea behind APB Reloaded. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, the player versus player that is cventral to the concept is horribly unbalanced. To give you an example, a fresh player with reasonable third person shooter experience can pick up a weapon off the real money market and dominate matches just like that. Now imagine an experienced player with that same weapon. It's one of those cases of a free-to-player attacking a paying player and the paying player essentially going 'Lol, stop it, it tickles! Here, have some bullets!'   I've touched on the subject a bit already... The game's community. To be frank, APB's community is utterly terrible, filled with asshats, trolls, and plenty of children who think they're MLG level hot stuff. Combine this with that pay-to win imbalance... Yeah, a ten year old with his daddy's credit card will kick your â¥â¥â¥ more times than you'd care to admit. And both children and adults will announce their pro skills and taunt each other and whine about Haxoorz in the chat. Oh yeah. Hackers. They're there. Not as much as a lot of the people in the game would tell you they are (Every time they die) but they're definately there and a force to be reckoned with.   Did I mention the customization?   I didn't mention that, did I? silly me.   The level of customization you can apply to your character and vehicle is... Mind-boggling. Simply glorious. It's the main strength of the game, in my opinion, but unfortunately it's subscribed to that same Pay-to-win philosophy as the rest of the game... Less so, however. Put enough time into it, and you, as a free to player, can potentially look just as cool as that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who sunk 2000 bucks into his kit. He may be able to one-shot you with his god-pistol from a mile away, but hey, at least you'll leave a cool-looking corpse!   My advice for playing this game? Avoid actually playing the game like you're supposed to. Don't play the PvP, you're bound only for frustration and rage. Do side activities, They award more cash faster and, while they can get a bit monotonous, there's plenty of ways to stay entertained. Remember what I said about the demolition derby? Actually happened. There's plenty of people in the game that are just as bored as you. Oh, yeah, there are decent people, it's just that the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s are pretty loud. Criminals can make cash a lot faster than Enforcers, simply because their activities are largely dependant on the envirionment- mugging, robbing stores, jacking cars, you get the picture- whereas most of the Enforcer's income is largely dependant on criminals. And that PvP. You want cash as an enforcer? Gotta engage criminals in PvP to get it. Which is probably why the beginner areas are always swamped with high-level Enforcers. They want some easy cash.   Honestly most of this game's problems can be traced back to the Pay-to-Win PvP and the Enforcer's lack of quick cash income. THe only way to really have any fun with this game is to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around. As a free-to-player, attempting to take the game seriously will only end in your frustration.   I rate the game's premise 9/10, but the game in it's current state 3/10.   TL;DR: You're going to die to kids with their daddy's credit card a lot. Look forward to a toxic community and lots of salt in the area chat 24/7. Hey, the character customization is really kick-â¥â¥â¥, though!
7854	0	a	You ever wonder what it's like when you mix elements such as Massive Multiplayer online capabilities and Great free-roaming environments together? Heh, me too... You might want to check any game other than this one. So, go on, get out of here before your elders see you desacrating your family honor...
7902	0	a	It wont start up. :I Plus I saw videos and the graphics and stuff look pretty bad. I can start the game up everytime I do it doesnt work. :I
8392	0	a	This game is pretty awful. There is virtually no one on the servers. The game itself has a lot of unrealistic physics and gameplay is pretty choppy. The character creation menus are annoying and tedious to work with. Even the tutorial is boring and virtually helpless.. Not a fun game to play.
7248	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
1799	1	a	This game is great. You can have a criminal character or an enforcer character, and engage in PvP combat with other players by starting missions within the game. It is PvP based however, so if you aren't into PvP, I wouldn't recommend this game for you, for there are no bots to kill aside from the civilians. There are open-world crimes that criminals can commit and enforcers can witness, or there are official missions with objectives, which yield higher rewards and almost always throw you into a PvP situation, unless you happen to be one of the only people in the district. Some open-world crimes you can commit as a criminal are mugging and ram-raiding. Overall this is a great game for people looking for a Grand Theft Auto type of game for free, though this isn't too much like Grand Theft Auto, honestly.

3322	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APB's new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010's deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results.  The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first game's devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one.  Reloaded's missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars.  These do happen more regularly than before â little adrenaline shocks to punctuate hours spent bumbling around between jobs. More often, playing Reloaded's missions is like beating your head against one of San Paro's flat, grey concrete walls.  Mission locations are invariably overlooked by high ground. The first team to occupy that ground is the de facto winner, possessing sufficient cover to pop anyone who comes close. Grenades can't flush them out. Well-versed players will simply set up camp in an unassailable location and sit out ten minutes of screaming frustration. San Paro is so full of hiding spots and high ground that it's far easier to put someone else's mission under lockdown than it is to complete your own.  Urban renewal doesn't seem to have been high on GamersFirst's list of priorities: APB had the same spatial problems, and the same tiresome missions. The new devs have instead focused on the economy. Reloaded is free to play, supported by item, modification and vehicle sales, as well as a premium semi-subscription option. Steer clear of the latter and you get obnoxious little reminders telling you what you could've won in XP and in-game currency if you'd stumped up the cash.
3481	1	a	i have had a tons of fun hours and a ton of bad ones, but this game have super fun gameplay and amazing customization lvl both to your character and car. the down sides is minor compared to how fun it is playing.there is allot server issues, but every mmo have that form time to time. another bad thing is the community, (for me its a fun thing) all the fun hate whispers i have gotten over the years. sadly right now the devs is trying out some weapon mechanics that straight out destroying the game  and the devs takes months to fix obvious broken guns.
8207	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ took 8 hours too dowload and wouldn't even let me run it
619	1	a	Game is absolutely amazing. Love it in every way I can. Alot of actions to perform and challenging games against other players.
5863	0	a	its not very good in general the animations arew choppy the leveling system is bugged and it feels like a gta 3 clone
8400	0	a	its bad... granted ive only played for about 2hrs, but.... its so bad. cars? bad. players? bad. Community? really bad. when driving a car, trying to steer the bloody thing takes forever, like turning a yaught or however you spell that. its guns are generic and you'll easily die if you didnt pay for any new guns. it doesnt matter if your on either side, both sides will team kill for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'n'giggles. its just bad... so bad 
7811	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.
2912	1	a	this game is absolutly awesome
5506	0	a	Ya, how about no.
6339	0	a	Used to be awesome but the updates made it laggy and crap.
9695	0	a	I like the part where launcher does 1kbs update download. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥
5177	0	a	I've been on and off this game for about 2 years. To me the game overall is a decent idea and the customization is the best i've seen compared to any other game. The things I didn't enjoy about this game is the matchmaking. Dispite what happened in the past with the flood of aim bots and hackers; The match making is also broken.   Why is it that a gold player can just decide to join a bronze server and womp on all the new players and get just as much money as they would in a gold server? THEY SHOULD BE AUTO KICKED, Threat levels should mean something, not just a color where they recommend you go.   fix this, or your game will crumble.
5590	0	a	worst game ever won't launch
9760	0	a	Think about Hitlers hate for the Jews. Multiply that by ten and you have my feelings for this game.
2759	1	a	Needs a Mac version of this game ASAP!
210	1	a	Its a pretty cool game if you look beyond all the technichal issues.
6652	0	a	horrible, i hate it honestly.
2259	1	a	7.9/10.Bronze district full of high ranks,silver district full of people â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tting that they're a pro colby player and after 2 or 3 days they got banned ayy lmao, and social full of people asking ' can you give me a free car? '. #JustHanServerThings
2830	1	a	This game took me by suprise it drains your time and is very fun GOOD GAME!!!
4153	0	a	I thought this game was very bad as the setup was very slow and i had isues installing it due to it containing a virus and hacking my firewall.
3258	1	a	come try this game out with me! my name in game= Mimistacy (enforcer) its not that populair but a bunch of ppl still play it! super fun game and rek ppl on and also costume ur own cool car/costumes (see my screenshots of APB)  HAVE FUN xxx
3041	1	a	Good game, basicly is GTA multiplayer where you can choose cops insted of gangsters xD wepons could be better!
10337	1	a	Yeah its good, Not a waist of time. Bacically its your opinon on games
10582	1	a	I played that game years ago. I remember that was great! Now, I download it and see if better;) Probably will not disappoint ..
1243	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
2605	1	a	As a grizzled APB veteran with a staggering 2.4 hours on record, I can safely say that this game sucks alpaca gooch.
8393	0	a	Extrememly pay to win, can't even play the game since everyone has much better guns, vehicles and clothing, once you drive around the city running down citizens it's no longer fun.
3343	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.
5505	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tutorial, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that keeps running even when you quit. 10/10 would play again
379	1	a	It worth all the costs... 'cuz it's free :D
312	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
9420	0	a	i could never figure out how to log in or even make an account. i never got past the damn login screen.
4516	0	a	IT DOESNT EVEN LET ME START UP THE GAME! When I start it up, it says I'm playing the game... for about 5 seconds, and then it just shuts down for no reason. And in that 5 seconds, the window for the game doesn't even show.
5873	0	a	its not very good in general the animations arew choppy the leveling system is bugged and it feels like a gta 3 clone
645	1	a	My first impression of APB Reloaded is possitive. I think, when playing together with friends, it will give you a nice co-op experience where tactical team-work can be a vital advantage.  Though personally, I find it not so straight forward on how everything works. Like choosing different weapons, how the missions and objectives work, etc. But it gets clearer ones playing I suppose.
4687	0	a	Fun for a while, but very pay to win and ruined by hackers. Punk buster was a hassle to even get working but now that that's gone it might be worth playing again.
1430	1	a	cool. nice shooter doensnt seems there's alot of hackers
10484	1	a	Fun, little funny. But you know, its an everyday thing to get ate by a mutant chicken right?
5945	0	a	Cant first person why its easy to add in
7391	0	a	p2w but good balance for being a free2play game.
8882	0	a	Appeals to a large variety of MMO players but due to the lack of support over the last few years and the constant downtime and crashing nowadays i just can't recommend this game to anyone.
5039	0	a	Micro transactions with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game overlay. Another fine product by Sony Online Entertainment. 
1665	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome MMO with a slick addition of adding RPG elements to the game.  The pros: There are 2 sides, Enforcers and Criminals. Both sides have their own Private Vehicle(s) which the owner could later customize and just make it look badass to say the very least. There is a wide veriety of different weapons which you will be thrilled to have once you buy them. Criminals can actually commit crimes and then get busted by the Enforcers. It's a very nicely polished game over all, so download it, it's free!  The cons: Starting out without a real tutorial is fustrating and you will be walking around the map, mugging citizens, stealing cars, and shooting everything until, of course, you will run out of ammo. One team with OP items can be enialating the other team with newbies that only have starter pistols.
1781	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a great game. It has one of the most massive customization abilities in F2P history. Everyone can be as unique as they so care. Not many hackers, easy to learn to play as well. The game features a fairly large car amount to have what car you would like. Same goes with clothing accessories. However, the game is mostly pay-to-win. You need to spend real money on silly things like a 30 day SMG. Or if you accually want to make a cool/complex customization creation, you need premium to do anything. And the game is good, but hard to play without the best graphics card available. It crashs about 3 hours in so this is not the game for casual players or hardcore players. The game still features great cars, good guns, a wide veriety of contacts so you can rank up and get new guns and cars as well as clothing items. After all the things i've just written, this game still gets a thumbs up, because all those pay-to-win type of things its alot of work to keep servers up and to make this a graphicly good contender to other F2P. It still needs alot of work, but as long as you stick around you will see how much the game can be, and will be improved. With 450+ hours, I approve this message.
4528	0	a	&gt;make character &gt;spend half an hour on customisation &gt;get halfway through tutorial &gt;start a mission &gt;team logs off, 1 vs 2 &gt;can only carry two weapons and two grenades &gt;starter weapons are inaccurate, slow, and do next to no damage &gt;guy with three overpowered shiny rainbow guns basically stomps without any effort &gt;decide to try hiding &gt;in about thirty seconds, he tosses a minimum of eight grenades &gt;lose the mission &gt;in chat, 'How did this guy get so many grenades?' &gt;random player responds 'stop hackusating noob' &gt;'What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is hackusating?' &gt;get banned  I guess it's fun if you have a ton of money to blow on badly coded pay2win trash without even an ounce of balancing.
1654	1	a	Yeah there may be hacker but what would you expect from anygame of chorse there going be hacker we cant help how other people are but for you hater out there i recommend you get over it because there hacker everywhere even in new games. there alway will be.
932	1	a	It's like eating â¥â¥â¥â¥ and drinking diarrhea at the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. Basically it's just bad
9198	0	a	Don't download unless you are willing to wait hours upon hours dowloaing it. Then waiting more hours downloading an update when you want to play.
7185	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
10194	0	a	When I did downlaod the game, it would let me play even though I had made an account for this game. If there was something that I didn't do, please tell me. 
1945	1	a	NOTE: I have over 400 or so hours logged in this game on another launcher previous to me joining steam.  I will not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fair fight. I will not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a friendly player-base. I will not recommend this game to anyone who wants to fight simple AI without challenge. I will not recommend this game to anyone who does not have a lot of spare time. I will not recommend this game to anyone who cannot deal with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t GMs or Devs I will not recommend this game to anyone who has an anger problem.  I WILL recommend this game to any and ALL video-game masochists and sadists alike!  Pros +GREAT Customization +There ARE 'good' players here. +This game does NOT hold your hand.  Cons -Old players are mostly â¥â¥â¥â¥-heads. -â¥â¥â¥â¥ Dev Team -â¥â¥â¥â¥ GMs -Could do with less 'cash pay' bull-â¥â¥â¥â¥. -Needs a genuine player base -Stop catering to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Thank you for your time in reading, this game really had some serious potential! It was marketed properly, it played very well when I was in, but now the reviews I see are far beyond disappointing. Clean up your act APB, you're like the boxer a child roots for until he crashes his car into a school bus full of gifted and talented children.
8053	0	a	hard to set up i uninstallled this game
8441	0	a	Literally aids
7994	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
5798	0	a	Meh its just meh, its not good or bad just... meh. Its free so you can give it a try, i played 20h on â¥â¥â¥ or smth like that. There are beter f2p games on steam like team fortress 2 or warframe.
445	1	a	If you didn't get what you excepted from GTA Online. This game is freaking perfect for you. It's way much better than GTA Online. First of all, It's open world in a server for 90 players. There are 5 different maps(excluding special maps for special days). There are so many online things you can do in the offline mod of GTA series. You should definitely give it a shot.
8001	0	a	Pay2play soooooo much... Game - 0 $ ALL DLC - 123,97$
9152	1	a	Online Fallout New Vegas....Confusing at first but exciting once you get the hang of it.
419	1	a	Great Game with 2 sides to play :D You can play as a Criminal or as a Cop thats amazing :D
10287	1	a	I played this game abit now, and I quit for along time, I had no frineds playing as a FEW lost connections. There are minor things, but it is a good game. The first things to KNOW/DO is find the NATURE teacher and get GEOLOGY going and Start farming. Each Town has missions, and then Missions to SEND you to other areas, you dont need to follow them, but they will PUSH you up the levels. There are MANY types of levels in this game.. WORK your SKILLS, and BUILD what you can..Your SKILLS are important...and then Look at the WIKI and decide WHERE you want your abilities.
5379	0	a	i do not recommend the game. i have payed it a few times before but always ran into some kind of issue. this time my char that was saved in the system wont load and it kicks me. when i try to make a new one i cant get past making a name and choosing a server. waste of time.
7432	0	a	this games balancing is the worst of any ive ever played
1879	1	a	Steal stuff from stores, kill Enforcers, Get some nice weapon and start fight against the law!
7033	0	a	The game seemed promising enough at first but when I got in a car I noticed the most peculiar of happenings. The driving lagged...a lot. like when I tried to turn left, it wouldn't turn for like a second or so after I pressed the button, leading to some frustrating driving. This one seemingly insignificant drawback successfully ruined the game for me.   Final Verdict: 2/10
6120	0	a	like an awful version of Crackdown
10261	0	a	If your going to play this because it looks like Fallout, don't. It's much much much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier.
19	1	a	  It needs a seperate tutorial map (also instructions for the controls). That way, new players won't be confused in the situation they're in.
2166	1	a	Okay I guess. heres a list of pros and cons  Pros: -Amazing character customization -High population districts -Fight clubs to practice  Cons: -Silvers must play with golds -Horrid Driving -Bad Optimization -Bad Match making -Bad Graphics -Never any new content -Greedy Dev Team -Not really any new content announced for the future -Hit the head or the legs same damage  
8463	0	a	Terrible game pay2win
2761	1	a	A very well made Free to play game. Think GTA settings except better everything. there is TONS of customization for gear and cars to make your own personal theme.  Handles lag issues from Australia ok (except for driving but you get kinda used to it). Considering its free to play, it is very much worth checking it. Having tons of fun.
6524	0	a	It's hard to call that playing as it kept shutting down. Buggy.
2950	1	a	Awesome GTA MMO clone
6128	0	a	Pay-2-Win laggy hackfest. Criminals are given an extremely large amount of bonuses and advantages over Enforcers, rendering Enforcer an almost unplayable faction in comparison. There are a number of guns that you can only purchase exclusively with cash that have a clear advantage over the free guns. Enforcers cannot get all vehicles, whereas Criminals can. Criminals are able to gain more money, faster, have backup privilege, have biased missions where they can run off with the deliverable items, longer mission times for them to siege objectives, shorter mission times for them to defend objectives.  The game is dead.
1884	1	a	Really the best F2P game i've ever played!
9735	0	a	It sucks.
4733	0	a	Character Customisation = Dank Uninstall Button = Dank
874	1	a	 TL:DR  Good game, community bandwagon raging about random stuff that doesn't exist as big as they make it sound   So there are a lot of people screaming 'Over powered gunz' and stuff like that, it's really kinda absurd. I played this game F2P for about a year before I bought Premium and I really haven't noticed a difference other than an XP boost and a few customization increases here and there, which I don't use because art to me may as well be a trashcan.  -Yes you can buy guns, are they more powerful? By default, yes. But they have massive draw backs and are really a case by case basis, and F2P guns that you can get can be modified to be more powerful than a paid gun.   -Is the community toxic? Yeah, kinda...A lot. You find a few snowflakes here and there who are nice.  -Population has been really good recently I personally haven't noticed a difference and I'm primarily on HAN, I still see people complaining but I'm willing to blame that on people jumping on the band wagon.  -Hackers? Not really..I've seen a total of 2, in about 3 years of playing, (Yes my hours are low, I played on and off for those years and originally started off with the standard APB launcher, instead of through Steam). Yes I understand they exist, but people say it's covered in hackers which I disagree with.  -Matchmaking. One thing I hear a lot is 'Match making iz broke'...It's really not, the game finds you a match based on the most suitable players, I'd rather get my â¥â¥â¥ kicked by some R255 then waiting 50 minutes for a match, and more often than not being paired against a R255 I can still hold my own meaning I'm getting paired with people of a similar skill level to me. Personally, I've rarely noticed the match making have any issues.  (I remember it used to have major issues, but they did fix that sometime this year, I think it was)  Overall this game is fun, it's well made, bugs are minimal and are patched quite quickly, I personally really enjoy what this game has to offer, I haven't been able to find a game similar to it and really enjoy it due to that.  Yes the Engine update is like..3 years late now? But really, I'd enjoy the engine update, but the game works fine so I see no issue.  There's so many things you can do within combat alone, depending on what enviroment your in and what weapon you're using as well as what faction. For example.  I play Enforcer, commonly less than lethal, now instead of killing people it tazes them, no it's not instant and it's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to do but it's fine, and once tazed you may arrest the criminal, keeping them in respawn for longer. Most commonly people will go Lethal, that's your shooty bullets that kill you, yes they hurt, and weapons in that category ranges from sniper rifles to machine guns to shotguns, the diversity of weapons is great.  Then there's the massive customization options, regarding vehicles &amp; players, even death music if you're that type of person, which I won't get to into because I'm a trash designer.  Finally your clans, you can get just your friendly clans or 'pro' clans, mostly always have some form of a symbol on them and roll around in force, which makes the game a lot easier for the people in clans as you aren't getting paired with randoms, and let's face it...Randoms aren't really people you wanna be with.  This game's 'Flaws' that the community rages about are blown out of the water, most players are just bad and blame it on hacks, or 'bugs' like most games.  I just edited this for the Steam badge Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯

2163	1	a	Overall a really nice game. Has a nice character customization. I would compare it to a Saints Row / GTA mix. Great to play with friends and is overall very fun.
769	1	a	Epic Multiplayer fun for the low price of zero.
5831	0	a	Love the idea of this game. What I don't like is that it feels like playing counter strike. Everyone spends their time jumping up and down to avoid bullets. And the initial load up procedure is horrible.
2884	1	a	This game...Too damn good; been playing only a week and cannot seem to stop. The community is mostly good, and the gameplay smooth and well put together. This is one of my only reviews on steam and for good reason, I don't consider myself fair enough to not be overcritical, download this game, its truly free with premium mostly involving looks and vehicles.
946	1	a	A Fun remake of GTA For the PC For Free â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥IT!!

10334	1	a	I thought the game has some real charm to it. Despite the high level of people who comment, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about how hard the game can is (if you can't follow basic instructions then you should be playing on a console, not a PC).
2653	1	a	i get to draw â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and other insulting icons on my car to strike extra fear into the enemies
10513	1	a	Updates are going up again. Hi-rez said that they 'Have enough resources to continue updating the game' . 9/10 Very good game but lacked support for too much time which may lead to no more players coming ... Still recommend it .
6381	0	a	Fun and all but it takes time to play and some people dont have time
3918	0	a	The only good thing this game has is its character customization the engine swap is not going to fix the fact that most of the weapons are balanced terribly, weapon and character modifications make no sence, the real stupid strafing back and forth while shooting being a liable tactic, the hit boxes being bigger than your character so when crouched behind a wall you are still able to get hit by enemy fire, the moving up and down behind cover and maintaining good accuracy while shooting, Being thrown of course while driving because someone that is not on your mission rammed you and flip you over and lastly the fact that some of the weapons that are secondarys should be a primary weapon. APB needs more then an engine swap it needs to be redesigned and re balanced in order for it to be a good game.
170	1	a	Fun game ,I play this all the time on and off and enjoy it . There are some player balance problems but overall if you not one who goes completely mental when you lose you will like it. very satisfying when you kill an elite player by hitting them with your car after they ve killed you 10 times.Loads of charater and veichle customisation as well.
6786	0	a	okay honestly, i really dont like this game, i really only play it for the character graphics, and car graphics. because besides that the gunplay is homestly horrible, guns have horrible accuracy, the gaming commuinty in cancer and the maps are small boring and repitive. but the absolute WORST thing about this game.  is how big the company who made it â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s you out for money. i mean many people will tell you that its not pay to win, and i mean thats kinda true, you get rent guns with in game money, so you odnt ever need to use real money, however if you want to get a gun that you can keep, well then my friend you are going to pay a arm and a nutt for it, because in this cruel world, ONE gun, yes only ONE! will cost you the totaly fair price of 20 EFFING DOLLARS!!! FOR ONE GUN!!! so i mean, pl0x save yourself the time and money and just buy the better version of this game gta V and you will get guns that you can keep for FREE!!
6593	0	a	why no worky
1632	1	a	Its a cool game play ir
9957	1	a	If you want a Fallout like MMORPG then this is your game.
10019	1	a	The beginning verification and updates were long and so freakin' annoying,but the game is good.
9764	0	a	As entertaining as stapling your ballsack to the ceiling.
8490	0	a	I like this game but... when i open it. it crashes
9709	0	a	spent a â¥â¥â¥â¥in hour downloading this just find myself downloading more updates. didnt even play it. because of the 10 hour updates i had yo put up with. dont waste your time here unless you love watching â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'update' for 200 days.
5081	0	a	Before I abandon this game for good let me say it's been quite ride and this is my final no holds barred honest review of this game. Make what you will of this review I am going to try and cover everything I saw good and bad, so you can make up your mind about it yourself but go in informed.   Pro's 1) Customization is great and you can do anything you really like, that to me is the hallmark of this game and it's greatest area it excels in, I myself did design and sell some great Bishada Rapiers when I played but it alone is not enough to keep me playing. But I reccomend it for customization options, and for that I give a 10/10 on the ability to do so.  2) Driving physcis is also nice, you have a variety of cars and how they handle varies by car and how you kit the body. However as someone who appreciates and enjoys racing in games this game has some really good driving physics, they did pretty good so even if they fail elsewhere this does help make up foe something.  3) Fight club is a great addition if your looking for pure action, however this comes with one of the cons that will be made apparent later, so please read further for the con of hackers/cheaters. Thr fight club is fun and challenging and you can getsomething you can use in game out of it if you do the objectives. Joker Tickets are something you can get some good stuff with but you need a lot of them. So for this feature yes I would say it's worth it if you just like combat or need to blow off some setam.  4) The car selection is great and you have a wide variety with many body kits, but these kits are ARMAS only and thus you have to pay in to get them. However there is enough of a variety of makes and models to satisfy anyone, though one shortcoming is a lack of motorcycles which would make for a more interesting experience.  5) The social district makes dealing with everything like customizing, selling, and hanging out with friends easy to do in a nice safe environment. Honestly it's a good idea to have, that way your not getting shot at while checking the market or ARMAS store. It is also the only area where you can go AFK and not time out from the game, so if you gotta go for an hour or two pop yourself there and go afk.  6) Weapon selection (non-ARMAS) is also expansive and covers a variety of weapons, however most of them are 10 day rentals for what you pay but it's worth it at times especially if they have slots you can fill your self with modifications. However there are also some real duds for weapons, and each weapon often is good at one thing but not good at another. However some advice, never discount your normal starter STAR 556 assault rifle. It is one of the best guns even if others would disagree, shiny new gun failing ya use your STAR. So IMO the weapon selection is nice compared to other games, as you can get a variety even if their temporary.  7) Modification system is also a plus, the various modifications allow for your own style of character, so to keep it simple this is a great feature.  Cons  1) The community is one of the most toxic communities in an MMO, when I did missions in bronze dsitricts you'd have silvers and golds playing there stomping everyone below their rank. Then they might say 'Get Rekt Noob' or something nasty and vile for kicks. This game has numerous trolls and A-holes who get their kicks in your misery, bronze districts are where most of the action are at but should be for bronze or lower only. Golds should stay in gold districts, and silvers should stay in silver districts. Also in social district you see a lot of sexual or perverse chat that is just distasteful, so often I ignored chat there. But as for more about this toxic community, I have been insulted and sneered at for even someof my hobbies if they came up in a conversation. A majority of the golds and silvers are elitist A-holes who like to wreck your day for easy wins.  2) Matchmaking/threat system is garbage, and as such makes for some very imbalanced matches that end up with one side having all of the advantages.  3) Small dev team means little gets done or it takes too long to do, therefore things they promised that should be out by now seem a long ways away from ever happening if they happen at all. The two biggest failed promises are the following. - Graphics engine upgrade - Matchmaking/Threat system overhaul  3) Hackers/cheaters are everywhere even with fairfight which JUST flags them and someone at G1 must ban them which happens more with the european servers than north american. If you want to play the frustrating fights against wall hackers, aim botters, trigger botters, and other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ go ahead. Cheaters are why I mostly stuck to ram raiding and mugging, to be perfectly honest.  4) F2P limitations are horrendous, for example as F2P you can only do like 7 decals on a car compared to 50 for premium players. You can do like 12 or so to clothing comparedto 50 for premium players, and so on and so forth. They really limit one of my pro's with these paywalls on how many decals you can use. This is a great sign of a Freemium game which EA has pulled off with SWTOR, don't get me started on that pile of garbage.  5) ARMAS guns are great if you can afford them, not so great if your facing them and cannot match them. Those pieces of crap can do much more than anything you can get normally in game, unless your skilled with your weapon type anyone using an ARMAS gun will likely wreck your day. So prepare to pay an armand a leg to get oneof these permanently, as inless your paying 2000 to 3000 G1C your just renting them for a limited time.  6) Map layout is a hot mess and each map plays itself to a certain style of play that really limits options, so if you would rather more rooftop battles use Waterfront, run and gun battles use Financial. However the maps are limited in size and some areas that look accessible are invisiwalled off.  7) GamersFirst themselves are a greedy company who only cares about your money, they do not enforce the terms of service so if that enforcer is camping the criminal money laundry and busting and defeating everyone who comes to cash out. Tough luck pal, they can camp the laundry and contacts with no consequences. Players can grief you, harass you, basically be abusive A-holes and they will not discipline players even if reported properly.  8) Graphics are quite dated and we have not recieved the promised graphics engine update yet, so if you prefer better graphics then this game is not for you. In fact they out a buffer memory limit on customization because of how much memory ittakes from the game to show every detail you put into something.  Overall I would not reccomend this game, it is clearly being kept on life support by G1 via ARMAS and the elitist A-holes who keep playing and paying into it. You'd think they would put more money into it, but they do not. I would rather play Defiance than this for an MMO shooter, or for another game check out Triad Wars as it may be more to your style. So goodbye APB, I will not miss you and I have given as blunt a review as I can.
2476	1	a	Basically GTA f2p
6081	0	a	So good it wont even launch great game really.... i installed it in steam and it says it did not installed properly
7874	0	a	game sucks. it doesnt even load up for me and for some reason everytime I wanna play the game it has to install everything again which takes about 2 minutes. Just play Killing Floor 2 instead people this game is horrible
6015	0	a	My hairline cutter made me play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was legit, but one flaw. I try to noscope someone and it doesn't work. Wtf? This is the worst game i've played since call of duty ghosts. I feel like i just cut both of my wrists while making a remake of GTA. ok? Stop trying to make a GTA and get a life. if i cant make yawspeed, what is life? i cant 360 just by pressing Q? WTF! This is the worst. @FaZeRain @FaZeAdapt @FaZeApex @FaZe Banks @Faze Blaziken. I hope that this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ on in 2 hours. I am not ever going back to my Hairline Cutter AGAIN, because he told me about this â¥â¥â¥â¥. before you get this game please look at this..... @EverySteamMemberThatViewsThisStorePage
4870	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this 'no update' â¥â¥â¥â¥
3651	1	a	So awesome couldn't even get it to launch!  11/10
3816	0	a	Customization: Check Cars: Check Hacker termination: Pending... Error Code: $$$ 'They buy ARMAs gear so won't get ban'
571	1	a	Really fun for a free game.
8582	0	a	If you want to rage quit download this game, if not go find another game.
1226	1	a	asome 
2313	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
3894	0	a	22 minutes 'played' yet unable to even start the game or register a user or redeem my bought code
6584	0	a	I have spent a hell of a lot of time in this game and sadly don't enjoy it anymore due to the low level of customer support and the continued deterioration of gameplay.  Constant lagging, rubber-banding and blatant rage hackers have further ruined what was already a fairly toxic community. The complete lack of GMs certainly donât help matters. Truly a shame considering the high level of customization and potential the game had. 
5812	0	a	I dont like this game anymore cause i have good internet and its just crash game and you have to have money cause its stupid to start with out money
9149	0	a	just sad cannot get game to open been at it for a while unistalling and re installing. attempted to get tech support and it was like standing in a desolate canon to only here my own echos. i have searched firewalls, check my port forwarding and even defraged the game. but to no satisfaction. I am unable to recommend this game or not recomend this gaem do to i cannot even play it. oh well i guess i will go spend my moneys somewhere else. to those who can play the game i hope it is funa nad entertaining.
8418	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.
4988	0	a	Unless you like microtransactions, don't even download it.
3715	1	a	is this old? plz tell
2495	1	a	its the greatest game ever :)
8024	0	a	Calling this a GTA clone is an insult to GTA. Calling it crap is a slap in the face of feces. This is just a terrible, terrible game with ps2 era graphics and gameplay.
6338	0	a	10/10 Would not play again.
1743	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
1116	1	a	This game makes me think a bit of an online GTA, but in it's own way. Things like chasing the bad guys or rob stores gives the game a fun twist.  It has been a while since I played the game, but I really had a problem with the game performance (even with a decent gaming setup). I hope this got fixed in the last year.
411	1	a	Cannot kill because everybody is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ with pay to win. 10/10
7617	0	a	Game is horrible, feels cheap and generic especially in the physics realm. Don't download this garbage.
3798	0	a	PROS -You can create good clothes -You can create good cars -Enjoyable if you can kill people.  CONS -BAD FPS -LAGGY SERVER -PAY 2 WIN -CHEATERS -SLOW LOADING -MACROS -MATCHMAKING NOT FAIR AND ITS TAKING SO MUCH TIME.
10467	0	a	nope, just nope, if you wanna use guns prepare to be completely broke throughout
9291	0	a	Wont get load beyond the launch screen
836	1	a	this is a great game and i been playing it for 2+ years, still don't get bored of it!!! 
5183	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
10813	1	a	A great shooter where the skys are never safe, run, jump,fly and slide your way to victory. Tribes ascend is and I enjoyed my time playing but sadley As of July 2013 Hi-Rez has temporarily ceased further development on Tribes: Ascend to focus on other upcoming titles but keep in mind you can still join up and play the game with the content that has been released just dont get your hopes up for more.
3027	1	a	very nice game
10237	1	a	It's not Fallout online, but since falout online got cancelled, this is the the equivalent of Champiosn compared to City of Heroes. It's not what we wanted, but it's a god damned good attempt.
8020	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
180	1	a	The only game that made me uninstall itself. 100/10 Would uninstall again.  Okay just kidding.  This game is great with customization and everything. But all I'm asking for is a little performance fix. Sure, I may need to upgrade but, they should work on the performance more. Rarely, the game runs smooth but most of the time, it's just like watching slideshows. The game stutters A LOT... at least for most of the players, of course. And these stutters made us an easy target. Then get whispered 'noob', 'f****** n00b', and all the different versions of calling people noobs. And that's most of the community. Seriously. Optimize this game. Or at least try to.. or whatever.  But I still recommend it to people who has a lot of ram. There's tons of options for customizing your character, your vehicle, your kill theme. The game is basically a little GTA and a little Saints Row mixed together. So check it out. Das it mane.
10639	1	a	I liked this game. Like a lot. But then I decided to get Smite as well. Also made by Hi-Rez Studios. Got Smite, but never played it or Tribes: Ascend. Decided to start up Tribes one day. Got an error message saying 'This game must be launched through Steam' even though that's what I had done in the first place. Launcher for Tribes still starts up but there are missing textures, and there is a static progress bar labeled: Connecting to authentication servers, or somthing of the sort. Trys to relaunch game. Same thing happens. Tries reinstalling it. Same thing happens. Tries uninstalling Smite. Same thing happens. Tries reinstalling Tribes again. Launcher actually works to some extent, but with the same missing texture problem. After installing, I launch the game. Missing gui and textures everywhere. Cursor does not appear. Most likely due to missing textures as well. Manages to join session of Capture the Flag. Models are there but all the textures are gone. Manages to exit game feeling very dissapointed. Goes to store page to write this review. Decides to reinstall the game once more after the review is done. Ok, now I really like this game, and that is the reason I still reccomend it. But this problem needs to be fixed. I'm not sure if the textures didn't download correctly and the launcher didn't notice the problem, or if they were somehow put in the wrong folder in the game directory, but I'm fairly certain that this has happened to at least one other person in the world. Thank you for reading this review. Spread the word to your friends, and tell them to tell their friends and their friends will tell their friends and so on. Tell them that they are not alone in the world of bugs, and glitches, and mishaps in programming. Tell them that help is (hopefully) coming from the developers. Thank you, and goodbye.
2216	1	a	it is telling me i need a apb laucher that i did not install it correctly what can i do to fix this issue
10338	1	a	It kept me busy before fallout and will keep me busy after fallout, great game great community. Does need new content badly though. Until then there is still lots to explore and do. Totally addicted
1269	1	a	mugged tons of people, had $5000 worth of stuff, started driving to money laundry, mission started, got shot in the face, lost all my cash  10/10 would get shot n the face again
8082	0	a	Simply a huge load of crap.
6261	0	a	Does it spread cancer? â Does it ruin your life? â Do you get called a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every time you kill someone? â Does it have 255 level players with grenade launchers? â Is that grenade launcher op as â¥â¥â¥â¥? â Does it give AIDS? â Do you still want to play even though this game is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥? â
5710	0	a	Its gay and for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es
7643	0	a	Nothing good to be found in APB Reloaded.
1158	1	a	The best shooter there is as long as there no hackers in the game your playing.
6781	0	a	got it never played it maby when i first got it  not a good game
10793	1	a	Created an acc on their site so i could play, i then try and login with the exact acc name and password but it still says that i have an invalid password or username, then tried to fix this by entering my email and it pops up with this acc does not exist. After doing this i try and create another acc with the same details and it says that this acc username and email are allready in use 11/10
5947	0	a	i cant really say if i can recommend this game...press play then it goes to the loading screen then the loading screen goes away and nothing...hard for me to say weather or not I like it or not
8888	0	a	Dig the game, but the shortcomings are a bit too many. The crafting system gets to be a bit unbalanced, and the length of time it takes to make things, can frankly put folks with jobs and real life responsibilities, off. Add in a slew of cash shop items that give you insane advantages, and you can begin to see the problem. This feels less like fallout, and more like a generic mmo with cash shop.
10820	1	a	great game playing since closed beta
1757	1	a	Pretty fun..more like GTA. Play a cop or a crimminal in teams with objectives. The only downside to this game is that its Free to Play and the players have made the game 'unplayable'. Way to much cheating and just rude players. Not worth it, but it was fun for a few minutes.
4310	0	a	it needs more stuff for the free to play players
898	1	a	- Had a lvl94 Enforcer account - Some criminal shouted 'PRESS K FOR PREMIUM' - I Press k, - Got a team of bronze while im gold and against me team of Ursus, Sitting duck and Raptor + Bloodymary, - Was 1v1'ing against someone with sitting duck and got jump shotted, - Teammates was spraying all around the map with ntecs hoping to hit and kill someone - Respawned in a car like nothinghappend, - I get out of the car and suddenly I get run over by the new IO GROWL, - Ragequitted and went to my other maxout account.  10/10 Would get ran over again.
599	1	a	The best game ever :*
5856	0	a	This game no idea what its trying to be
5654	0	a	If you like getting camped by rocket launchers straight out of spawn. This is the game for you.
5092	0	a	It's a GTA clone without the charm of the characters, all the characters there is have the same bland 'bad boy/girl' theme to them, the voice acting can be pretty funny on some of them. Well, in my first hour of the game, i spawn in for the first time, guess my guns are ok, bullets come out one end so i can't really complain, then i get completely destroyed by somebody who payed hundreds of dollars on this game, fun fun fun! The customization this game boasts is soooo limited, unless you give the devs money, of course. Also, is it just me or is everyone with a female character dressed like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥?, with all that customization i would figure you could at least be creative. The gameplay is kinda stiff, but not horrible, driving cars feels like your wheels are covered in vaseline and it handles horribly, bad driving in a game where you need to get around ruins it for me, but just throwing in the PTW and crappy starting gear complete's the package. I give it a 2/10, dont bother
3311	1	a	Excellent FTP game that is fun to play with friends or just when bored. Downside is the lag that you may sometimes experience from this games heavy usage. Other than that this game is truelly amazing for being free.
3326	1	a	Doesnt Support dual screens, so i had to disable a screen to play it, throws you into a game with no information on what you have to do or when or how. all the quests are as followed, go to point Hold the F key. Pick up thing with the F key drive back to start point. get reward. Driving is terrible cars handle like they are on ice every mechanic in the game is clunky and un refined to the point of it being unusable. Quests that use PVP are simply defend point or capture point while killing people that respawn over and over for 10 minutes. when u die ull respawn about a half minute walk away from the action. youll die in 2 hits, they will die in about 2 Clips. no exceptions. camera sways from side to side like your drunk in gta4 with roman. everything about this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. a person i know just said that you have to get used to it, but id rather not lower my standerds of play. The only people that play this are the sad people that cant justify paying for it before it was f2p
7588	0	a	Lags All The Time Even With My Monster Computer.
1912	1	a	I dont know why everyone is so mad. I mean, there are a lot of people that hack, a lot of things you can buy for real money, BUT the game is still really fun. (If you can, bring a friend, it only makes the game very much better)
4325	0	a	*sigh* where do I even start with this unoptimised garbage lard piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game? 'what? unoptimised? Your PC must suck!' NO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I GOT A 970 UP IN THIS B*TCH with an i5! so don't hop on my d*ck. This game run at 50fps with dips THE GRAPHICAL SETTINGS DON'T DO SH*TTTTTTTT SON. The graphics aren't even good anyway. It looks like a sim city saints row 1 a** graphics. Lastly NOTHING I MEAN NOTHINNNNG is explained. I spawn in with this stupid a** WHITE TRASH NASTY GIRL and some pledge so ol bull. if my pc can run sr4 and everyother games with HUNDREDS OF FRAMES THIS PARASITE OF A GAME SHOULD RUN ABOVE 500 frames OR HIGHERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR      I'd rather rub my â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a cheese grinder than play this game.
3641	1	a	I'm generally very picky about games, but this I've enjoyed for 4+ years and still to this day enjoying it! Matter of fact, I bought a gaming computer just to run this game the way I wanted to! No regrets at all! Great and amazing game!
10333	1	a	If you like apocolypse type games, this one is great. IF you like CRAFTING! THIS is the best game ever for it. well close enough. XD
8986	1	a	Fallen Earth is very good free to play post apocalyptic MMO. It reminds of Fallout for some odd reason that I can't see to figure out. The world is really well done and the combat is satisfying enough to keep you engaged. If you like post apocalyptic games and MMO's as well this is the game for you.
2856	1	a	Cool game :)

3732	1	a	cool
5622	0	a	Do not play this game if you can't tolerate other people's lack of intelligence.. this game is a gathering place for special people.
9967	1	a	This MMO is, well almost identical to others like most are. And honestly i don't mind. I like these kinds of games more than enough to play them, especially if they're set in a universe or atmosphere that I am enjoying (a great example being SWTOR or KOTOR because I am a huge Star Wars fan). But one thing i like about this, and this is similar to Destiny (which i also loved), is how it combines your tipical MMO with a first and third person shooter stile, more tradisional in big AAA games like Call of Duty, Battlefiel, etc. This means as well as these MMO's were you running around leveling up and colectiong loot you also get the FPS experiance were you get to aim a gun at your foe and blast in to bits rather than pressing 1, waiting for your ability to charge and pressing 1 again, then waiting for your ability to charge and pressing 1 again, and so forth. And if you dont like that, if you prefere this method of spamming 1, then you probably wont like this game unless there is some way to change that (which i don't think there is). It is set in a large apocalyptic landscape were you can join and hunt factions, use scavanging and mining or brutaly murder NPC's to gain money, play competative pvp or i assume clan wars. Or you can go out and be a d*ck to other players, by killing them on sight just for the fun of it (I won't judge you... unless you kill ME). But i just love it when games combine elements of these two game types and i think it works really well. BUT i have not been playing for long and this review could RAPIDLY change from thumbs up, to thumbs down, as i play this games more, and learn this games back-to-front. Signing out.
8317	0	a	While they are not bad, this game's graphics require more hardware power than games that look twice as good(for example FarCry3) I also found that controlling the car was quite difficult with the keyboard making the game (to me at least) nearly unplayable.
2923	1	a	APB is what GTA should of been. Best of all, it's completely free.
10638	1	a	The sense of achievement and closure for theoretical physics that came with the brilliant success of the classical field theory of electromagnetism was short lived. The new technology invented out of the mathematical unification of electricity with magnetism produced copious data about the nature of matter and light that snapped all of the mathematical threads that physicists had just succeeded in tying down.  And after this new data was unraveled and understood and explained using mathematics, the unified worldview of classical theoretical physics became split into two very different views of the universe -- the particle view and the geometric view.  Particles and waves   The first sign of trouble was when J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897. Experimentalists began to see data that suggested a model of the atom with negatively charged particles orbiting around a positively charged core. But according to Maxwell's equations, such a system should be physically unstable
10552	1	a	Fun To Play,Addictive,I love the skiing system but... i hate the players... whenever you kill them they say OMFG NOOOB!! and the unbalanced matches where one team has new players and the other has like veterans. those are my only complains.  Also, IM DOWNLOADING IT AGAIN, â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEAH, ITS GONNA COME BACK TO LIFE! hopefully  Edit: Fixed some awfull grammar and punctuation errors, i can't believe how â¥â¥â¥â¥ my english was when i wrote this review
9706	0	a	its fallout done wrong
404	1	a	u love gta v but don't have enough money? apb is your answer :D it's an awesome 'cops and crocks 'game
4368	0	a	Came back to this game for the third time and its still the only game i most disrecommend , hey devs how about you use this game to wipe your asses when you finish polishing it which is never going to happen.
1491	1	a	Really Good Game 10/10
5593	0	a	I'll keep this simple. Bad graphics, gameplay, customization, and community. Mostly positive? Whoever's given this game a positive rating needs to seek professional help immediately. Avoid and go play GTA 5.
6074	0	a	bad, a lot of bags
8590	0	a	i couldnt even run it when i start it would open the launcher and the it finnly loads about after 10 minns and crash gg would crash again 10/1000000000000 IGN
8210	0	a	IF you actually manage to get this game to open and then work you way through tediously creating an account with a third party.  Gameplay 3/10 - Quite laggy and driving a car is very difficult while lagging. There is a very steep learning curve and you are thrown in the deep end Community - 0/0 - Toxic... Expect to be insulted and flamed from the get go Graphics - 6/10 - Nothing amazing  It's basically a poorer version of GTA online. I really wouldn't waste your time  
5244	0	a	FPS drops harder then the twin towers
1761	1	a	You can be an 80's cop and shoot people with an LMG.  10/10
3242	1	a	Has lots of problems, mostly created by G1. Fun though. Lots of potential.
2507	1	a	Great Customizations!
5717	0	a	pay2win game. i just play this game only for stay with my friends and the first mission i do was me and 2 other guys versus a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing team of shoppers. 
4669	0	a	Don't EVEN bother.
7794	0	a	Imagine a game like GTA, but the graphics are about on par with Saints Row2. the Character customization is awesome, the vehicles drive like . . . like . . . like a pat of butter on a hot skillet. I don't know if that gets the idea across. The controls are hell. Sure, the combat holds up, but you are only going to be playing with 3 other people. there are no OTHER criminals in the city, there are no OTHER cops in the city . . . it's just you and who ever is logged on playing cops and robbers VERY intermittently. The game sounded really cool in concept but they FAIL to deliver. This is the multiplayer side of a poorly crafted game with no single player activity in a lifeless city full of cowardly ragdolls. I never figured out how to open a door without kicking it open. But I must say, props on the character customization; we know where the money went.
1392	1	a	How do i fix that .dll error?!?!
9484	0	a	Just not my type of game. I dont like the way I have to switch between combat mode and having to switch back to do anything else with the mouse. Graphics could be better.
10564	1	a	The fast paced action of this game is just to fun. I remember when I was a kid playing this and the tension was so high I shot a tree thinking it was an enemy!
2736	1	a	great game if you don't mind disconnecting every 30 minutes or so on the weekend. do not play this game during summer, or only play around 6-9 AM EST, when all of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 12 year old brats are asleep. during school season, 4-11 AM EST is a decent time block for playing, since they're all passed out by then. the cash shop â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t is just that: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. paying for access to the premium shop, and then paying a subscription for your extra special guns really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks and you should never, ever do it. always best to play with a group of people for missions, since good tactics and communication always beat shiny cash-shop â¥â¥â¥â¥. besides being able to have really intricate character customization, i really enjoy getting in my obnoxious van and following people around while playing stupid music. attempting to follow traffic laws is pretty fun, and a difficult challenge.
7394	0	a	Worst game ever unless you got a big wallet! DONT PLAY IT!
3058	1	a	Awesome game. MMO version of Grand Theft Auto.
4353	0	a	it's a NO from me
3537	1	a	Seems like a very fun game, but every 5-10 minutes I get randomly disconnected.  10/10 would get disconnected again
9482	1	a	gas masks are ace. auto favorite game. 10/10
582	1	a	it says it requires very little but my pc has better then that and still has pretty bad frames but in gernerality It is very adicting and fun
1420	1	a	Its Verry Cool and Verry Cool Weapons
9097	0	a	Was a great game but gamers first killed it wiith bad updates :(
2801	1	a	I enjoy the join friends factor of this game. Being able to group up with friends and go out on a mission of chaos as either a criminal or a law enforcer is completely fun at times. The game itself can be challenging unless you like games where you can kill others and just cause utter mindless destruction. I also like the options of gaining different clothing, guns, vechiles and such for doing missions. And if you are especially creative, you can make emblems and designs for clothing, vehicles and sell them on the marketplace to other players for in game money.
3667	1	a	I was playing this game since release and was following the massive revolution of this game. Awesome game with Rich customization system like: Cars, Clothes, Sounds, Symbols and etc. In another words very awesome Cusomization system. The combo of Shooter game, Cars and Multiplayer IS JUST TOO AWESOME. The good and the bag guys are fighting each other to decide who'll rule San-Paro city... BUT unfortunatly there is a BIG BIG BUT, the game is ruined, as I said, I was following the game revolution from the beggining and I have to say that the more Updates, the more pack they add the game becomes JUST WORSE!!! Meh what's the point... Just in the memory for the good olddays I make good grade but know guys THE GAME IS RUINED, DESTROYED, SMASHED, SUCKS, NON CARE ABOUT IT, FULL OF CHEATERS AND SCAMMERS!!!!!!!
7800	0	a	I remember when they announced this Game, i was very excited, i mean who wouldnt u could make a clan with your friends, run around the city on customed cars and clothes make gangs catch bad people. Ect. well the game didnt live to anyones expectatives, it started as a pay to play after a few months became free to play. enough said.
9499	1	a	how do you make a account? 
3995	0	a	Great game concept, but plagued by extreme P2W and infested with cheaters and Brazillians.   Stay clear.
5307	0	a	This is one classic EPIC Pay2Win game with crazy laggy server. If you want to get a nice stroke during playing with your PC, this game is definitly your first choice.
7871	0	a	This really is a poor game. The sheer difficulty of leveling up without paying is just unbelievable. Matches are unbalanced; I was often put against high level players despite being new to the game. Furthermore, the ammount of things you have to pay for just to get certains skins and modifications makes this one of the worst freemiums out there. Car choice is rubbish, the weapons system is very poor, you have to pay per week to own even the most basic guns and the lack of servers means sometimes I simply couldn't join. What an awful, awful game.  2/10
10313	1	a	fun as hell
7242	0	a	 ~3000hrs spent actively playing outside of steam
32	1	a	Great game, you dont really need to pay any money for it to be fun but I mean it helps I guess. Plus its free so if you dont like it you arent really loseing anything but time.
5999	0	a	unless you shell out some cash for a good gun (you can grind for hours to get it with in game currency), you're gonna die
3571	1	a	It didn't changed much in the last few years. I had a lot of fun playing this game 2 years ago :) I played it like 500 hours on both sides and it was the best F2P open world action game that I've ever played in my entire life. The best thing in All Point Bulletin is the possibility of custimazation. You can change your car painting, your kill music that your victims will hear after death, your character (almost like in the sims)  Right now it seems that APB is dying a little cause of only 2k people playing at the same time. I hope somedays they will renew that old masterpice for the new players :)  Otherwise I'm recommending this game to people who don't mind that there are just few servers.
2011	1	a	This game is fun once you start coming upp in rank
9035	0	a	worst game ever , with the worst gamplay first. 1. low and shity graphics  2.bullcrap story 3.pay 2 win 4.dont waste your time on this peace on crap
8987	1	a	Pretty Damn Good
2312	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
204	1	a	this game is good exepct some of the things i would change the auto balance should be improved bigos sometimes they are a bit sucky
6980	0	a	You know the idea of this is great and all, but the fact that it is a pay-to-win game is still completely real. Would I ever play this again? No, but if the devs of this decided to make a singleplayer campange(cant spell) of this game with optional co-op I would love this game but until then I will stay back and watch what happens. Do I recommend this game? No, but if you have lots of money to burn on a game go ahead. Even though i have a low playtime, I am aware of this pay-to-win stature because of when i went to customixe the starter vehicle, it said 'You have too many stickers(lol wut i forgot what they were),please delete some before finishing.' The. Car. Started. Above. The. Non. Premium. Limit. I Was like UH NO THX ILL PASS. I basicly turned a great new ar bak to its original state cause PREMIUM HAVE INFINITE STICKERS BUT I DNT.
1862	1	a	APB is one of the best game youll ever play .. OMG the designs the symbols the guns are too awesome But:  if your under age do not try it because you get banned  if you wana cheat or aimbot or macro ( any form of cheat ) then dont bother fair fight will ban you  Its the best game ever but you have to be the right person for the right game  Thank you G1 for this awesome game
6995	0	a	Horrible game and company dont waste your money...both me and a friend got banned for absolutely no reason...we hadnt even PLAYED the game in over a year, suddenly we get on and their fairfight system bans us the second we log off? thats cool.  I spent like 3-400$ on this game, never playing their games again.  Email them try to follow up, and they basically say 'that sucks'  Started playing the game(looking over emails here), on 11/2/2012, never made it out of silver, never got any crazy stats with any of my weapons, i was better with some that others obviously but eh.  Then after almost 2 years of completely ON AND OFF play(mainly BECAUSE of hackers running around in the game), my friend gets on tells me about the fairfight system, and how he has not seen any hackers since, i get excited i hop on, play literally 1 mission log off and boom.

5378	0	a	This game, is pretty great. 'Why the thumbs down then?' Hold up. Im getting there. So I heard about this game from a friend and it was free so I was like, hey its free so why not? Well it was pretty awesome at first. Then I actually got into the game, and it was SO. VERY. LAGGY. I don't know if its just me, but it was REALLY, REALLY laggy. Though, when I did get to play it with minimal lag, it was pretty great. Though the missions tended to get a bit repetative. Other than that gamebreaking lag it was great.
617	1	a	Great if you want to get bald asap.
4358	0	a	I would like to say this is enjoyable as a Cops and Robbers game. I really would. However, this game boasts: an unnaturally spiteful, venomous community; misleading, restrictive pay-to-win microtransactions that holds too much sway over making-or-breaking the game; non-user-friendly technical support that somehow encourages more trolling and hacking than is present any other game; and boring, repetitive missions that have less flavour than any other MMO or shooter.
1439	1	a	It don't know where to start... As I have been playing APB:Reloaded since the open beta in 2011, I came up with many things that are very good and some that are pretty horrendous.  First the pros to this game: -the best customization system I've ever seen in a game -a challenging progression curve IF you endure, but very fun -good gameplay with depth in it -replayability  And now some cons which I will go into further than into the pros: -very slow development(we are waiting for more than two years now for the engine update, nothing special was implented during that time except a new car...) -unbelievably expensive prices in the cash store(sometimes about 10â¬ for just a cosmetic item. You are more or less forced to pay something for this game to really be able to play it. For example, the customization is restricted for free players and you can only use it to its fullest when you have a premium membership. Though, it is pretty regular that codes for premium membership are given away)   In Overall, the game is very good and you will have your fun with it IF you are willing to get used to the gameplay and invest some money into it(about the amount of a AAA-game).
2778	1	a	 Easy to learn, a lifetime to master
944	1	a	i recommend this game. its like a free gta..
3603	1	a	It's a great game but they need to improve on the guns and the missions for the cops but overall it's a great game
5586	0	a	HATE IT wont load and its glitching like crazy ]:
1268	1	a	Pretty good game idk why u guys are so mean like yea it crashes it makes you play more, i dont feel like it makes me play forever im not so good at designs but i like it!!! 9/10
10744	1	a	It's like halo, except all the spartans are on speed with jetpacks and can ski!
7349	0	a	I've played far too much of this game, and let me go ahead and tell you not to make the same mistake I did.  For the sake of new players or those interested without knowing, this game is effectively a PVP only game, everything that results in progression in the game is done through fighting other players of the opposite faction.  The game may see some improvement in the future, but as it stands, this game has so many problems with balance, stability, etc that it simply isnt enjoyable.  For the longest time, I've played this game dealing with what issues it has to enjoy the cornucopia of interesting features and customization that the game has, but all in all it isnt worth it. The servers are laggy constantly, skill level seems to not matter at all as far as player placement is concerned, and many players including myself are stricken with constant jerking and stuttering. Now I can't discredit the game too much for the stuttering, thats probably more on my end, but the game has more then enough problems aside from that for me to wholeheartedly tell you not to play this game.    Problem #1: 'Matchmaking'   Notice that matchmaking is in quotes, there is a reason for that. APB doesn't really have much of a matchmaking system to speak of. Players are allowed into and recommended to go to different instances of the games two districts based on their current skill rating, while the player's level is generally not factored into the allowance into a certain instance of a district. This at first seems like a relatively fair system, those who play better would soon be designated 'gold' skill level players that are allowed to play on gold and silver level districts. Gold players are absolutely abundant in this game, and this leads to one of two outcomes for any one given time, Either the gold servers are full, so all of the gold players are in low player skill designated districts,  OR  the gold servers are completely empty, and therefore none of the golds want to go there, so they still go to low skill districts. Now, this basically means that no matter where you are, what level you've achieved, or what skill level you may be, you're going to run into a bunch of golds. And more than likely, they'll destroy you. Now I know what some of you may be thinking 'Oh you're just a noob complaining about getting owned by other players, stop whining and get better at the game.' And while I will admit I am not the best of players, take this into account: I normally hover around silver skill level, this means that I can access pretty much every level of server, if I feel ballsy enough I can go to a gold district, I can stay in silver (filled mostly with golds) or I can go to bronze with lower skilled players. Being silver and not wanting to fight all of the gold players who all are extremely high ranked and all seem to have a rocket launcher pointed directly at your face, I started to play on the bronze districts. When in a bronze district one of two things happened, I either encountered bronze players and my fellow silvers and had a relatively balanced match, with fair fighting, good play on each side, and everybody had a decent amount of fun, OR I had a team full of bronze players and was matched against a team with 4 out of 5 players being gold. Now, gold players arent generally allowed on bronze servers, but thats the thing, if you purposefully lose enough to get yourself to silver you can go right in, win once or twice and get your gold back, and proceed to stay in the surver murdering everyone.    Problem #2: Threat Levels.   Now your threat rating generally is supposed to tell other players how skilled you are, its a general measurement of your wins over losses etc, now this could be considered only measuring skill, more often than not however gold players have weapons that were purchased within the games cash shop, which are fully modded, and just monumentally better than anything you could get with in game currency even relatively later in the game. This means that for many players, the only reason they've achieved a gold rating is because of superior equipment. Now don't get me wrong, the game is not entirely pay to win, you have just as much opportunity to destroy people with guns purchased with in game currency, many of the high level guns and modifications are equally effective if not moreso than the guns one can purchase with real money, but the problem is that all of these gold players stepping all over your play space makes it extremely difficult to progress at all. If you're constantly losing to gold players with fancy weaponry then you arent going to progress far enough to get the weapons that supposedly make the game's cash shop 'balanced.' So basically, 80% of the time or more, any gold you see is only gold because he has a shiny gun he bought for 10 bucks. Some people get there the hard way, but its alot easier when you get great weapons at the get go.    Problem #3: The Cash Shop.   Now, while the cash shop is of course necessary for the game to EXIST due to it being free to play, its also the reason that the game is so damn difficult for anyone who chooses (or simply can't) pay. The problem here is that the game is entirely player vs player. You can't really say that a normal MMORPG that is heavily reliant on player purchases for player success is truly pay to win, because you still have the option of playing the game without conflict in order to reach the goal of power, but in this case, pvp IS the game. You PvP, its what you do. The cash shop gives players the opportunity to buy fancy customization, clothing, cars, gun skins, you name it its there, but it also has straight up weaponry available. If you so choose you can enter the game, and without having done anything, buy a gun who's statistics are on par with a gun that would take hours upon hours upon HOURS of someone who isnt paying for a premium subscription to achieve, and not just because of the cost, but because of the fact that you have to unlock them before purchase. This means that everyone who has bought a gun has an immediate advantage over everyone else, while this may not be very detrimental to a game with more of a PVE focus, this game is ,as I have said far too many times at this point, purely pvp. This means that every person that has bought a gun is not only making the game easier for them to play, but it is hindering the possibility to actually progress through the game for others. If other words, if all I can fight are people with fully modded guns, and I'm say, a level 20 bronze player, then I wont be able to level up very quickly at all, wont be able to get any kills to progress the games statistic based weapon unlock systems for certain guns, and therefore basically can't play the game effectively lest I pay to buy those same guns.    And Now for some less connected problems.      Problem #4: Server issues    This game has had some of the WORST server performance I have ever seen. With sometimes constant rubberbanding, lag, and general connection issues, it can make the game a downright pain to handle.  To be honest, I used to love this game, even with some of the flaws it had and still has. The guns are fairly interesting, the cars handle uniquely, the customization is one of the game's strong points being one of the BEST customization systems that you can experience in a video game, and even the quirky limitations of the game, such as the lack of head shots or any articulation based hitboxes (everyone has one, uniformly sized hitbox). But to be honest, without paying a metric â¥â¥â¥-ton of money, you are severely limited by the players who do. The community is awful as well, with hack accusations being dropped like raindrops in a storm.  The game just isnt worth it in the long run for the amount of crap you have to go through to get anywhere.  Maybe someday. Maybe someday.
16	1	a	great game if you want to lose your hair and die early.  10/10
3675	1	a	game is bad but its my most played steam game and will probably stay that way forever. god help me

7527	0	a	AWFUL, AWFUL GAME. The controls are horrendously awkward, and the entire time playing it feels like a game that wants desperately to be Saints Row. The entire time spent playing is wondering what i am even supposed to do. It feels like Gmod Roleplay added some cars and said 'yep that looks about right' and then tried to sell you expansion packs for $100. Dont waste the time downloading it. Buy Saints Row instead and you will end up gett a better gameplay experience, a story line, and characters that dont feel like cardboard cut-outs with speakers taped on.

2976	1	a	fun game but because of the Tweeny Bopper that play it and the de-threaters it can get on your nerves
4758	0	a	Character creation was fun.  That was all the fun this game had to offer.  Edit: Honestly, yeah, I'm an APB scrub-- and for a reason. This game is purely all show and no go just as much as it is a pay-to-win scheme of a game. (And based on your hours, I guess you fell for that.)   The developers would much rather keep their blockheaded playerbase happy with updates that exclusively include more guns rather than EVER updating the game's engine or fixing/ adding onto APB's bland as balls gameplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, I guess I can see that driving around and doing the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again could be amusing to some people. But I feel like that's just a very small demographic of likeminded people who require little to no mental stimulation.   This game literally offers nothing new or innovative and the hours you'll spend on it before realizing that there's nothing more to it, are spent making up characters or customizing other things.   I don't know. Say what you will, but every other review for this game just rolls over the same points I just made.   TL:DR I'm a scrub but this game still sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥.  Abridged Version for the APB: Reloaded Playerbase:  'yo, y u spendin' yo money on dis gaem when dere nothing 2 do lmao dis girl buggy as hell an she aint got no game, playa.'

9726	0	a	Gamersfirst, just what is this company? They are a company who 'buys' games from other companies. They are a company who believes that editing out original authors of game developers is okay. Their game known as Fallen Earth is great; however, the Game Masters of the game are corrupt. For the past few years Fallen Earth has been suffering from multiple pvp aimbotters/duplicaters and many more glitchers/exploiters, and what do they GAME MASTERS do? 'NOTHING' They believe that banning innocent players for no reason is the key, accepting bribes from known aimbotters/cheaters and other sources in order for players who are 'legit' get banned. It's wrong and outrageous and I believe that these Game Masters need to get what they deserve 'FIRED'. Tiggs and Dasterd both do this, sure sure, they are well known the gaming community, well maybe they should of thought about this before accepting money to ban legit gamers. Due to this, I give Fallen Earth a +1 for being a good game and a -9 for the Game Masters behavior. In conclusion, this game has received yet another 'Negative' review and Gamersfirst should be more cautious as to who they hire.
6416	0	a	This is just another 'Pay-to-win' game that is advertised as 'Free-to-play.' Sure, all you have to do is download and play, but you have to stick with crappy items unless you pay. It isn't the worst game, but it certainly is not great.
1143	1	a	Nice game, but the game would be more nice if you could throw grenades while in car. 9/10.
7834	0	a	Terrible matchmaking...nuff said
1547	1	a	Great game, don't know why so many bad reviews on the game, in my opinion it's one of the best games you would find on steam, for free!
5316	0	a	bad graphics and gameplay.
9725	0	a	WORST GAME EVER F2P more like p2w AND WORST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE DEVELPOPEFLEKN. DO NOT PLAY THIS PEICE OF SH**!
9548	0	a	this game is trash kys
8220	0	a	Hours, hours... HOURS trying to download and play this damn game. It is disgraceful that I have to register and validate my email just to load a game, and spend 5-10 damn minutes on the launcher just to start playing.. EVERY SINGLE TIME! This is crap. Crap. Crap! I love customizing games, but this is by far the worst.
1911	1	a	its great:D hard to grasp at first though
9441	1	a	Took six hours to install the game. Took another two hours installing updates. All this to crash repeatedly on start up. 9/10 great progress bar simulator.
10679	1	a	its just perfect ( : !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4492	0	a	Awesome concept terrible execution - be prepared for horrendous combat and vehicle mechanics with the only consolation being the in-depth customization of both personal vehicles and player avatars.
10414	1	a	this game is amazing it is really fun to play with friends or solo.The map is big so you wont get bored of your suroundings and there are always missions to do .The combat engine is realy good and it runs smoothly(even a laptop can run it)i would highly recommend this awesome game:D
1198	1	a	great game and best game for driving, talking to friends, and making chaos
8925	1	a	A game you must play at least once in your life (and will probably for the rest of your life).   At first the game is a little (very) confusing but as you progress and figure it out it gets interesting, fun and will take up a lot of your time. It first gave me the impression of 'just another game' but is very far from. It is quest based and leaves you wanting to complete more and more - addictive so to speak and the quests are reasonably challenging for whichever level you are. It has many items to loot and craft, every time you think you've figured it all out and there cannot possibly be any more it surprises you with something new and even more curious than the last.  Another thing I really like about this game is that you can ask for help at anytime and you will get it. Gamers are friendly and willing to help in chat. It gives a sense of comfort for those who 'get lost'.
9986	0	a	Post apocaliptic??? Survival game??? WTF, It feels like an mmo, not a survival game. 10/10 ign
4254	0	a	Don't get sucked in. It's garbage.
1023	1	a	Please make this for mac!!
7895	0	a	First impression bit sloppy Guide Player Base Seems like League of Legends Kids start screaming and flaming the moment it aint going in their favor and come up with petty insults overal the game's garbage
10240	1	a	Nice game if you have some free time. Just try to scratch out of living like in my glourious Poland.
10417	1	a	Uninstall button works... So that's a plus.  Seriously though, was this made in 1991? Warcraft 2: Orcs and Humans had better graphics and combat mechanics.  No shooting sounds, no walking sounds, barely any sound at all...
2341	1	a	In a Nutshell:  APB Reloaded is all I wanted from the original title before it went under and more.   The game is GTA Online on Steroids
6182	0	a	I wish I could recommend this game, I used to play it for a few years long ago (it was fun, especially with friends, the customization is amazing and it's an original concept) but it became more and more crap as time went by...  Why ? 3 things : - The 'pay 2 win' system, no words can describe how cancerous it is... You have to pay a lot for optimized guns, upgrades, cars (and cosmetics as well), that litteraly kick the asses of anyone not having the same upgrades...  - The hackers and cheaters. Always those,ruining everything, there's plenty of them here.  - The community itself. You barely have any chance to find a server where people are nice or helpful with the low grades and newcomers. Or even playing as a team. There's mostly insults, solo-players, and anti-fun people, added to the 2 first points I made above.  It has potential, really, but those things I listed just destroy it all. That's REALLY sad... I miss the days where it wasn't that deep down the trashcan. You can try it out and see by yourself, but quite frankly it takes time to get used to the game and I don't think it's worth sticking with anymore.  Good point to highlight nonetheless : it's free to uninstall.
8304	0	a	Bad game is BAD!!!! 0/100
7353	0	a	Come here if you like customization. The gameplay will make you rage, though. The game likes to pair you up against higher levels and/or people with paid subs. Both have better weapons than you and will kill you faster.
3282	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)
7655	0	a	full of hackers
6298	0	a	too boring
4193	0	a	Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.  Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.

7550	0	a	this game sucks its like 1fpm i cant even delete it with out it saying please close apb reloded well it is close
10260	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
6871	0	a	Many years have passed since I played the Closed Beta version of APB. Then I played the full version, released by EA. It was a good game, a fun game. I played with my good friends. We had a great time playing as enforcers, hunting down bandits. The whole concept of this ambitious game was brilliant. There was a lot of guns, cars and customization items. Sure, you didn't get everything from the start. You had to earn money to buy better equipement and other stuff. But it wasn't painfully hard. Now, when this game is Free To Play it suddenly became game only for rich kids. If you want to play this game for free, just forget about it. There is no fun for you there. I hate it when a decent game is dgraded to a 'free' to play crap like this.
5788	0	a	You'll only enjoy this game if your good. Other than that its a rage fest. Its not a pay to win, but as I said you need skill to enjoy the game or win it. Other than that the customization is amazing, but you need premium to put more than 5 decals on a car, 25 decals in an emblem, or 5 decals on clothing. The matchmaking is a complete mess, new people will really have a hard time when they get matched up with veterans...  I only recommend this game if you have the patience to die a lot.
901	1	a	Love the ple the APB!
9067	1	a	This game is by far one of the more enjoyable post apocalyptic mmorpg's combat is fun and interesting, the stat system is simple yet complex as you can choose what you want to be able to do in the game making it a unique experience for each indivual player. All in all a fun game to play either alone but more fun if you can get a group together making encounter's much easier.
4326	0	a	It is bad.
5611	0	a	if you play this game and waste money on it your the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person ever . in this you can camp roofs and shoot noobs drive a car have SUPER LAG!. its really bad and the servers are hosted from the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing moon.
4952	0	a	I have never said this about a single game I have ever played and im going to say it now. this game is cancer and needs to just be burned to the ground, servers and all. i have played this game for a good few days worth of time. if you are new plan on being trolled by everyone at all times. the community in the game is toxic and vomit inducing, this game is P2W so if you don't plan on paying money, plan on being the worst player on the server. the pay weapons have a demo version that makes them completely usless in every way. no joke you get to use a airsoft version of the gun for 30 minutes. (some how other players with the same weapon are able to 1 shot you a mile away like some kind of SMG sniper rifle) oh and im sure you are thinking 'oh ill just play for fun because its free!' well let me tell you right now that even if you do get into the game, the anti cheat system is bogus and broken. aim bots, clipping through walls, teleporting across the map, one shot kills from everyone but you. yes thats right this game is a broken pile and if i released this game i would be embarrassed, apparently this game just came out for xbox one and soon to the PS4, maybe it will be better on console but im not going to hold my breath. 2/10 for making a terrible GTA clone that only has 1/30th of the actual content.
2763	1	a	Is laggy tho.
2057	1	a	fun game but because of the Tweeny Bopper that play it and the de-threaters it can get on your nerves
4186	0	a	I really can't say I would recommend this game. The biggest issue I take with the game is the fact that the majority of the equipment you can purchase in the game (guns, cars, etc.) are time-based/temporary if you purchase with in-game currency. If you want to keep the weapon for good, you have to purchase it with real money (which defeats the purpose of this game being  F2P ).  To make matters worse, I would run into griefers/hackers every day &amp; decided the game just wasn't worth it after a short amount of time playing it. I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest &amp; I decided I was done with it.  If you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers &amp; hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...
7279	0	a	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T BECAUSE IT DOSEN'T WORK I rated -00.01/10
7462	0	a	This game is P2W... No match balancing system so if your new and you start, you'll get matched with rank 1-200... most people are donators with 1 shot snipers etc... The makers who made this really dont know how to make a good game.... its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ terrible
3295	1	a	YOU BUY G.I. 11/-1  A caring message from the Vietcong Recruiting Office.
4059	0	a	I have mixed feelings about APB. I appreciate that it's not another WoW-copy-paste McDonalds MMO, but I feel that some basic design decisions really hold this game back from being anything but frustrating. First of all, no story. I have no motivation to do squat in this game, other than 'just to kill people and get upgrades'. Second: pure PvP, and VERY imbalanced at that. There is no 'PvE' to speak of, and the PvP is absolutely lopsided, due in no small part to being able to BUY better weapons at EXORBENT prices. Almost all missions are PvP based, and the group finder has no problem pitting 2 players against 1, or 7 against 3 as I repeatedly whitnessed. There are just enough players PAYING for weapons to make most missions total blow-outs, absolutely unentertaining especially with the rediculously long respawn timer AND distance they put you away from the objectives. You spend more time waiting and traveling than playing the game. One hesitant thumb up, and one way down.  I've learned from APB and Dungeons and Dragons Online that I really do not enjoy the F2P model whatsoever. Either players are given rediculous advantages in gameplay (which breaks PvP games like this) or content restriction provides a lonely, frustrating game where the players are segergated by different levels of content access, as in the case of DDO.
3936	0	a	As a beginner, I tried to ask for help but sadly in-game if you don't know what you're doing, they trashtalk you, instead of helping, And yeah, this game has a bad community.

1566	1	a	much die so law enforcement  very MMO wow.
6696	0	a	The matchmaking after awhile sucks. I hate it after only a day playing it and people actually use money to win &gt;.&lt;
7831	0	a	Dislike It is so laggy its not my laptop not myversion of windows its the game it self
9312	1	a	amazing game.... always something to do... if you like fallout you WILL like this game.. its like fallout 3 but turned into an MMO and a better crafting system
8543	0	a	The worst optimization I've ever seen. (Maybe Saints Row 2 matches this game). It's ok when you walk but when you're driving, it's a nightmare... And also driving model is very uncomfortable.
5308	0	a	idk what to put so heres a waffle recipe:  Ingredients:  2 eggs 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 3/4 cups milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon white sugar 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  Steps:  1.) Preheat waffle iron. Beat eggs in large bowl with hand beater until fluffy. Beat in flour, milk, vegetable oil, sugar, baking powder, salt and vanilla, just until smooth.  2.) Spray preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray. Pour mix onto hot waffle iron. Cook until golden brown. Serve hot. ;)
1736	1	a	it may seem boring at first but when you give the game a shot you will see that it gets better and better.
1018	1	a	Love this game!
9011	1	a	i really like this game! top notch if you like the fallout series then this is the game for you! provideing you have a LOT of time spare i have put in over 50 hours and am only level 15 (cap is 55 btw) the map is hugeee literally travelling is my only negative point it takes forever to get anywhere oh and it isnt a p2w

2155	1	a	This is a good game. It can get boring from time to time, however it is similar to Grand Theft Auto maybe a little more bland however it is a good game I would recommend to people 8/10
6312	0	a	Fun game but can only play when my parents are not home, so it is not worth my time to play.
2223	1	a	takes a long time to load but it is fun 
5233	0	a	I honestly dislike this game. The game is repetitive and boring. You litterally do one mission in the misson mode. You crash into windows and collect loot too sell for low amounts of money. You shoot others in PvP. You get team-killed in missions, making them only possible when you don't have a group of idiots on you're team. The servers apparently lag. I didn't have the issue, but most people in the game said they did. I only experienced server delay. Press 'A' for a turn, doesn't work until a second later. Sometimes not the best thing. I do not reccomend.
1503	1	a	I rarely play it but it's still fun! when i started i no lifed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it 258 hours wasted i mean spended well.
5676	0	a	pretty boring game i think. It takes a long time for a new player to get anything at all in terms of cars clothes weapons and so on without spending loads of money for those stuff.  That's why i don't recommend this game.
1662	1	a	Best, Game, Ever... Or... Atleast It's Potential, It Still Needs Alot Of Work, But The Idea Behind The Game, Is Brilliant.
5795	0	a	In this games current state, its god awful. It rewards credit card warriors vastly. You can buy the best weapons in the game for next to nothing. And gives new players little to no direction. Just stay away.
5072	0	a	i tryed to play it i was exited but it took three days you instal  PLUS IT DOESNT WORK  Ok so it finnally got working BUT!!  Kick By Piggy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because i  dont have a1373c2.345  i do not request this game and i  find it a waste of time!
9963	1	a	Kind of boring to be honest. It's alright though, feels like Fallout online. If you like fallout and mmo's then you shoudl try it out.
2459	1	a	Not sure if I can say yes or no to this game. Full of griefers, full of rude people but so damn addictive... Just one more mission all the time.. I've been up all night on this. Gameplay incredibly unbalanced for PvP but still addictive. I have both criminal and enforcer. I probably spend more time in the designer than the game.  The intro movie makes you want to play it... the really crap player matching makes you want to throw your pc out the window. Too much microtransactions IMO but I have blown Â£100 on it so far just to have a few cool bits... its no different than subbing WoW for 10 months so why not. Its worth a shot if you HAVE THE PATIENCE and don't care about losing so some tool who has a grenade launcher in a n00b mission.
1245	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
1798	1	a	This game really deserves more players, it's good hyper-blasting cop-killing, crime stopping fun.  there are flaws but it's still great fun with friends  8/10
1342	1	a	fun game to play when you wanna kill some biittchees.

4088	0	a	&lt; Review by a highest rank/skill elite 'Gold' player with a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of hours wasted on it for the only satisfaction of kicking bully kid's butt. &gt;  WARNING: This game will make you want to see the real world burn and almost every human being die screaming in pain.  CONS: - Bad graphic (Screenshots look better than actual in-game graphic, and YEAH, I mean even with everything set on ULTRA)  - â¥â¥â¥â¥ty optimization: Intel i7 + GTX780 Strix 6GB + 24 fu*kin gigs RAM (pc used mainly as a Graphic WORKSTATION just to be clear) and this is the ONLY game so far that still shows stuttering, drops frames for no reason, etc. We are talking about 90-70 fps driving around and suddendly 30-40 fps with a single explosion on screen! The game graphic is from 2011... (for instance Battlefield 4 at ultra runs smooth lag-free at over 60fps costant framerate on my rig)  - Lag, server lag everywhere  - 99.9% of playerbase is made of bully â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dumb4ss kids with 'I-Am-God' syndrome  - Weapons are as realistic as toy water guns. But much less fun.   - Customization is useless and boring, after a while you will just forget about it and just play the same missions again and again  - No need to keep adding to this list, just figure out every possible question about things in this game and answer yourself with a convinced 'IT SUCKS'   PROS: - If you're skilled enough you can eventually kill those dumb4ss kids and enjoy their never-ending whining followed by how much they are stronger than you and hear details about how they will own you, your mother/sister and (i don't know who else cause at that point they're in my ignore list already).
5001	0	a	After playing this game for more than 15oo hours, none-steam and spending 500$. one day upon logging in I get disconnected and the ban hammer fell on me, after contacting support and meeting a bot called Dastard who kept sending me the same and same response, I lost all hope of getting unbanned and decided to take my revenge by writing this review, donât get me wrong Iâm not actually going to bash the game or lie about it, just the plain truth coming from a guy who used to have 2 gold max ranks. This game has many glitches, its p2w not f2p, and there are a lot of cheaters. I personally could cope with the bugs, glitches and its p2win-ness. Sometimes can say I enjoyed them, found them funny, but the main thing that makes you want to rip your own eyes out is cheaters. Well on that subject, there are three types of cheaters, first we have low rank blatant cheaters who are really easy to identify and are banned in a couple of days, and then we have high level (mostly gold max ranks) closet cheaters that are unnaturally good and you just canât get to kill them. When you confront them, they say we are pro or we have ts or blah blah â¦ sometimes you can see some of them who got caught on  ffbans.org . Now the third and the most annoying ones are whitelisted cheaters, G1 actually knows that these people are cheating hard but doesnât do anything just because they pay them a lot of money and if you dare report them, they ban you instead. Call me a conspiracy theorist or nuts, this has happened to people I knowâ¦ they caught these people cheating on video and reported them and those legit guys got banned after 3-4 days âDUE TO CHEATINGâ themselvesâ¦ coincidence right ??? so in conclusion, unless you are a masochistic I donât recommend this fail excuse of a game.
4394	0	a	This game have the most unfair ranked missions ever 3 players top ranked vs 1 low ranked. and this happens al the time  gameplay 6/10. but because of the stupid unfair ranked match i give it 2/10 Don't waste your time on this game...
2038	1	a	Full of circle strafing bunny hoppers
2985	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
5552	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can get banned for nothing Dont waste your time
4208	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
9072	1	a	Back when i first played this game, I had a ton of fun. Never thought i'd be into MMORPGS.
2113	1	a	dis game iz really guud
235	1	a	the game is a fairly well made game, its being updated all the time, which is nice to an to a degree, sometimes you will be in the middle of playing and you will get a warning saying 'server shut down in 10 minutes' its quite annoying, although this is rare, it will happen to you. This is a grinding sort of game it can be really annoying, ive been playing for about six months and im only rank 128, max rank is 255... there is also many hackers in this game, moslty in American servers. (joker) how ever the Hong Kong server is very good about keeping it clean. (han) anyways, hope this helps, want more info? look for my cannel @ XenonGaming or follow me on twitter!!!
5612	0	a	this game graphics dont look nice at all plus the driving in this game is really bad.
87	1	a	Hit a guy with a car , he flew atleast 50m into the air while having an uncontrollable seizure.  12/10
8370	0	a	I HOPE THIS GAME CRASHES all it is a pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥ and thats unfair to people that cant aford it why dont they make 2 servers one for paying people and one for non paying people
9196	0	a	The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics. At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this? But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥. The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me. The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ vampire love story for teens. Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission. I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.  Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.
10711	1	a	Tribes ascend is a rare jewel of a game that most people don't know about, and unfortunately will never really have the recognition it deserves. Set in the distant future, T:A is a FPS that utilizes a mechanic called 'skiiing' along with jetpacks to result in a 3d shooting experience where most firefights occur at while moving faster than you usually drive on the way to work. A good pathfinder in T:A can move in excess of 200mph. Pretty much every weapon in the game has a projectile with a travel speed, causing you to have to lead your target in order to hit it. There are multiple game modes, but unfortunately only three are played any more. There is a stardard team deathmatch where a flag is dropped by the first player to die. The team controlling the flag drains the enemy's reinforcement counter twice as fast for every kill. There is an arena mode, which is similar to TDM without a flag, usually on a small map, and is 5v5. Finally, the main game mode is capture the flag. CTF has so many aspects it is difficult to explain everything in a relatively short review. In addition to grabbing the flag and taking it back to your stand, each team has a generator which powers all things on their team. Turrets, sensors, dropped packs, shields, etc. are all disabled when a generator is destroyed. There are vehicles in the game, but they are not very commonly used in PUB CTF games. As with any game, there are downsides. Depending on your location, it can be difficult to find a server with a ping under 100 with a bunch of players. The game model is F2P, and you really don't need to buy anything to be competitve with a few classes, but if you want to play all of the classes with weapons that appeal to you, you will either have to play a LONG time or shell out some cash. If you do this, the GotY edition is the best deal. Morale of the story is: T:A is a great game, and it is free to try out. At the very least download it and play a few matches. If it doesn't interest you after three or four games, you aren't out any cash. Make sure you try to do a couple of tutorials before you jump right into a game though.  9/10

3054	1	a	Loads of potential, ruined by hackers, overpowered pay-to-win weapons, and a lack of excitement. This could've been an amazing game if it weren't for repetetive, unbalanced missions and hackers. There's also not much else to do while free-roaming. There's great customization, though. But that's about all APB Reloaded has to offer.
6797	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
2939	1	a	This game is so very addictive i have never written a review for a game befor but this game is awesome its a little PTW but the amount of joy and awesomeness far outweighs that negative impact... huge wepon selection... lots of different single player type missions and group mission (group missions are a bit on the repetitive side but if you got a good group its fun and there is nothing like jumping in a car and trolling the boys in blue with a few homies in your back seat droppin brass....)  If your looking for a fun time killer and wanna shoot some ppl up as a cop or outlaw this is your game i highly recommend this to GTA lovers....
4556	0	a	Cancer   Nah but foreels tho  This game is for a breed of serious gamers i will never fully understand, My best friend plays the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game. He admits its not the best game but he is so invested in it he cant stop playing #addictions
3269	1	a	Awesome Game (Y) :3
238	1	a	It may be a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ some times but when it works it rocks! i love the game because of its beauty and potential. some people see a trash game without any good things in it. i see a unfinished game that can turn into a awesome game! may be kind of a pay to win game but that just means you gotta upgrade yo skillz!
4545	0	a	Pay to win.   I mean, nothing more to say. All 'New' players are re-rolls, and are hardcores so they know everything about everything, and make sure that true 'new players' know that they are far more apt to everything the game has to offer.  This being said, I played this long before it was a steam thing, and used to be very good at it as well, but it lost its glory when it became pay to win.   3/10 - 'I'm a noob and know it' Simulator
3452	1	a	love this game
6419	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
7956	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
2178	1	a	I used to play and I was good, now I dont play and I am â¥â¥â¥â¥. Only play this game if you are going to be consistantly playing it.
10636	1	a	This is a fun, fast paced FPS. Check it out!
3866	0	a	pay2win.. also processor raper v3
8892	1	a	I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe. The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.  It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy. FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.  7/10 in my opinion to say the least.
4631	0	a	Just go play GTA4 multi!
1785	1	a	Awful game. Not enough ntec reskins.
661	1	a	...!
10602	1	a	This is by far the best fps game ive ever played. There are tons of different gamemodes that are great, and you can choose from different vehicles. I for 1 feel like this game would destroy all others i &lt;3 tribes ascend and there are lots of classes to choose from and that i will not tell you... why are you still reading reviews? PLAY THIS EPIC GAME!!!!!!!
2463	1	a	Makes me moist in my â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5419	0	a	This is stupid and doesn't work. After downloading the game I clicked 'Play' and it takes me to this pop-up window. I just suspected the game was downloading in that window because there was a loading thing, and when it finished I clicked continue. THEN it takes me to another pop-up saying 'Like us on facebook for free new items!' I finally went to the official site (Which I shouldn't have to, seen as how I downloaded this from Steam) and even their site was useless. DO NOT download this because there is no game to play on this.
3779	0	a	After playing this game extensively for a time,  APB is not in the slightest new player friendly in both mechanical and playerbase aspects. The playerbase is full of venomous, toxic people. Should you get involved with the community, you can expect DDoSers, griefers and undesirable people to bother you.  Mechanically speaking, APB does not in any way play like any other shooter. Many people will pick up an assault rifle, press right mouse and hold down the trigger, which rarely works. The gunplay sits solely around extremes, there are no in-betweens like in most shooters, which I personally find silly. Only shotguns and SMGs will be found in close quarters. Only snipers, semi-autos and (sometimes) assault rifles will be found in long range. You have to frequently change guns depending on the environment, which can be an extreme problem if you don't have premium, because there is a lengthy cooldown for the ammo box which can be used for changing guns and re-stocking. The only way to negate that long cooldown is to own premium.  The matchmaking is also hopelessly broken, and veterans will be placed against new players.  APB also suffers from a item shop dilemma. There are certain guns that are extremely potent, which can only be purchased via the armas market. Originally, you could outgun the OCA whisper or the CSG, but now there are pocket SMG guns, such as the Oca Nano, the extremely high ROF SMG that can be used like a rifle that is the ACES gun, so on and so forth. They aggressively market their items and don't even attempt to make a F2P variant that can compare.  The Developers are not only ridiculously greedy, but they also lack any talent. Most content is re-hashed or has minimum effort applied to it. Bug fixes are slow to happen. They've done nothing to fix the rampaging numbers of cheaters which have plagued the game since beta, aside from occasionally catch someone who's too blatant, or false ban someone who may be godly good at the game. On the subject of bans, a developer has come out and flatly said that all bans are final and that they are cheaters, no matter what.  The only redeeming qualities I could even offer is that the customization is unmatched, the vehicle play is a fascinating idea and the open world missions are a great idea, but could certainly use a lot of tweaks at later level missions.  I personally believe it may be too late to save APB, and that it should be sold to another company so that the customization can be harvested for a much better game.    
3761	0	a	It was fun while it lasted, the missions are too repetitive and the dialogue is poor and un interesting, the city is dull and full of mindless civilians that run in front of you or get in the way while you are trying to gun someone down the progression is the slowest i have ever played, the game is full of hackers and ddosers, the community cries and hackusates everyone who is good, the clothing in the armas marketplace is too overpriced and the weapons, all people do in this game is just sit in social district and talk $hit to one another, it's a good free to play game.. but you will get dominated by the crap matchmaking if you are starting fresh off a new character, only good thing in this game is the in deph customization that no other mmo has, but other than that it's mostly just a 'social simulator' full of cry babies and rage quiters and hackers, So if you wanna play it go ahead it's Free to Play but be prepared to be destroyed by the higher ranks..  'CAUTION: PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!'
2866	1	a	I loved this game, but i have a problem with it. Everytime i play APB Reloaded after around 2 or 10 minutes it Disconnected, I couldn't find the solution, What am i going to do? P/S : Sorry for Broken English
2345	1	a	i dunno man, this reminds me of Saints Row + Gta
2051	1	a	Fun game, ahs a lot of pay to get it quicker type deals but if your are willing to spend the time it can be balanced. If someone spends money it'll likely take you a couple of weeks until you are ready to go toe to toe with him. just an idea of how money can give you a huge advantage. i recommend playing with friends
10015	0	a	This game turned out to be bad now...
7080	0	a	While I enjoyed playing this game initially, the micro transactions and repetitive gameplay made this game feel like a pay to win platform. The customizability of your character is top notch, but doesnât excuse the fact itâs simply not fun to play.
8998	1	a	I entered the game and asked where the pros.titutes were, someone soon whispered me telling me to 'go play a more kiddie game like Runescape'.  10/10
4495	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ balance. New player are put against the best ones gg
7993	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
3120	1	a	My â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
7872	0	a	Not so good game in my opinion. Although it has a very deep character creation system and you can make chicks by your own taste. Graphics are cool, but very laggy. Servers are good. But there are way too many criminals. It's like enforcer is dying. I have stopped playing due to it's pay to win nature. Get this if you are rich low-life gamer.  PS: There is a nude character exploit.
350	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great multiplayer game with lots of chaotic fun. Grab some friends and jump in if you like third-person shooters without a cover system and open worlds like GTA.
894	1	a	The game has been getting better and I love the way everything is designed within the game. It feels great to play and the strongest weapons are free to play, dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
1068	1	a	This game could have been amazing, its got all the elements. Only problem is there weren't any significant updates after the game changed companies. It has it's share of problems such as cheaters, slight buy to win edge, lots of ram needed to play. However for its price (free) its an excellent game to kill time and the gameplay itself is great, best online 3rd person shooter ever. Also so much customization, cars, characters, clothes, music. Maybe one day a worthy company will pick this one up and improve upon the concept. Until then I'll kill enforcers. Over and over.
3608	1	a	A funny game, you can rage a lot on it but very pleasant, a lot of hackers but not every hackers are pretty cheat, some hackers are pretty bad and you can destroy them easily, some people will tell you that the game is a pay to win but it isn't a real one, if you don't want to pay, you aren't obligate, you can have everything for free but it takes a long time playing and if you're impatient, I hope that your credit card is full ^^
2769	1	a	APB Reloaded through steam was ten times fasted on the download/patch and game update. It like playing gta 5 online for free, with much more customization and its just a un experience. I have recomanded this game to many of my friends and i recomand that it should be played through steam.
7223	0	a	Very, VERY bad first experience. When I downloaded this game i had to wait over 4 hours to be able to join my server (EU), then when I was able to join, I was there for like 10 minutes until the server crashed... I'm probably just gonna uninstall now.
9109	1	a	pretty good i rate it a 7.6/10
4147	0	a	Pros: -Imagine the dream of the original GTA creator. Think about how revolutionary this game could have been. -Customizable vehicles, clothes and character (to an extent due to microtransactions business model).  Cons: -Play with the unfinished product of the original GTA creator, which really is the messy afterbirth resulting from the mismanagement of over $100 million dollars by the original game developers. Now deal with the Gamersfirst company that bought APB after the game's first official launch and subsequent bankruptcy of the original developer Realtime Worlds. -'Pay 2 Win.' Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Gamersfirst is milking the game before it dies. -The game is dead. Only a few hundred people playing it compared to the thousands before. -'Progression 2 Win.' Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Requires lots of character level grinding. -Poorly optimized. Requires a high performance computer to run subpar graphics. -Boring and poorly designed missions. Perform boring and menial tasks that are not attached to any real storyline. Experienced players (with or without Pay 2 Win items) will exploit the poorly designed missions and maps to win. -Ugly and lifeless city. NPCs don't do anything except walk around and yell during gunfire. They will occassionally glitch or disappear. The maps do not have enough detail and it feels like you're wandering through a ghost town. For a game about 'cops and robbers,' it makes you question the storyline and motivations of each side when the city and NPCs are lifeless like this. -rampant hacking issues since beta release 4-5 years ago.  Overall: 3/10 -Terrible. APB is still a broken game after 4-5 years after the first release. It was better during the Realtime World's beta, but somehow Gamersfirst made it worse. You may be curious and excited about the features shown in the trailers during the first hour of play, but APB Reloaded and Gamersfirst will suck your soul. IT WILL SUCK YOUR SOUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLL...  
1313	1	a	good game , endless fun with friends and customization is awesome
5170	0	a	Pros:  None to fully give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about.   Cons:  Everything in this game is based around taking your money. Very unbalanced pvp. This game was fist made from the GTA guys and then they failed and then Gamerloft and they failed and now the cherry on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ topping. Perfect World. (3 companies failed to make this a better game)  
6237	0	a	it is ablsolt crap i got done for nothing it is serisoly anoying pepole spawn kill so its a WASTE OF TIME TO PLAY so i dont recomend this 0/10
9305	1	a	I like this game a lot! I have played the Fallout series and it is simliar to this. Graphics are nice and there are tons of recipes. There is a lot of reading involved and you have to follow what the charecters diretions well.
10540	1	a	I remember playing this years ago. Too bad its ending
506	1	a	This is an awesome game,but all you need to know that, -It wont be easy out there you new players -Dont rage quit -Have fun -Have fun more by playing with friend -Love your character -Ignore the people with the nazi symbol -Ignore the hcker
3777	0	a	As you can see I played this game for quite a while, thouh I can not recommend anyone to try it out. I played this game with a very casual attitude but over time it becomes less and less fun for several reasons  The biggest reason of this is a mixture of bad game design and the community. Often enough you just see players abusing every aspect of the game to get an advantage. Some of them can be very hostile and unfriendly as well.  The biggest problem in terms of the game itself is the matchmaking. People are seperated into 4 different threat Levels, Gold, Silver, Bronze and Green. There are several instances for each threat level to play in. Each threat level is allowed to go into instances one level below their own level which results in the fact that Gold instances are almost always empty, becasue all gold players decide to go to the silver instances.   The distribution of threat levels is set so that the top 20% of players are given the gold status, but becasue inactive accounts aren't taken out of the equation (which means that every silver that quits this game out of frustration is still counted towards the silver group) it rather feels like 70% of people are gold, menaning the being a gold status is easy to achieve.  This results in the fact that average and casual players that turn gold are deemed to play against the super pros in this game a lot of times, giving them an experience of this game that is not fun at all. I might seem to you like a good player when you look at the time I played, but I was mostly on the border between silver and gold, meaning that as long as I play in silver instances I have to play a lot against people I don't stand much chances against. Since it is not that obvious for new silver players how enter a bronze instance they will most likely end up being put in the silver districts as well and end up being farmed a lot.  With this game being free to play there's not much wrong with giving it a try, but don't expect too much of a pleasant experience. I seems like a game with a lot of potential, but doesn't live up to much of it.
6518	0	a	SOOOOO much wasted potential. This game could have been what GTA online should have been, but too many flaws are holding it back.  The gameplay is very, very fun. Missions have you either breaking into buildings, hijacking cars, or hacking satellites if you are a criminal, or preventing criminals from doing so and arresting people if you are a dirty copper. While most of the time the missions are actually balanced and require strategic plays and superior aiming from both teams, there are plenty of times where mission objectives can be exploited by parking a car on top of the objective and shooting it til it explodes, rendering the mission impossible to complete. Not fair or fun. It is also very likely as a bronze rank you will get stuck against gold ranks with pay2win 1shotkill guns.  Also hackers. So. Many. Hackers. If you somehow manage to make it to gold rank, you will never be in another mission without an aimbotter. You won't. Ever.  Customization is amazing. Everything is customizeable from your character to the car they drive to the song the enemy hears when they kill you. But hackers. Always hackers everywhere aimbots hacks hacking hackers hacked bot botter aimot botting aimbotting hacks
7083	0	a	This game consistently gets worse.
10681	1	a	Extremely Fast Paced First Person shooter with jetpacks boosts and LArge slopes .   Try it it is extremly fun .   Capture the flag is the main game mode   Also offers Many other games modes to play from
8961	1	a	If you like fallout 3, this is the closest thing to it in an MMO. I am addictted to this game. Has older graphics but if you don't care about that, i would recomend it. I mean come on it's free.
2077	1	a	123
7306	0	a	Call of Duty meets Coips and Robbers. APB Reloaded looked great to me at first glance, and the trailer sold it for me. Then however......I started playing.  Don't get me wrong, this game does have a few good things that can be said about it. They actually put some work into a base storyline, that I feel could have done well if it's gameplay counterpart wasn't a pile of sh*t. 1. There really are nearly infinte amounts of customization options. If you're the kind of gamer who gets hot and bothered when you can change the shade of colours you never actually see, you'll be here a while.... 2. Aesthetics. The graphics in APB are pretty good, even above par in a few ways. The voice acting is also better than most I've heard. 3. Options. You can play the way you want. Maybe grab a rifle and sit on a rooftop, or climb in a van with your buds, grab some SMG's and have a good ol' fashioned drive-by.  But, the negatives are there as well, and I feel they seriously outdo the pros. 1. Free to Play.......Pay to Win. No matter how much In-game Cash you grind by doing missions and getting epic multi-kills, you can never actually buy a weapon. You rent them for a week......a week! One would think that this time limit would at least make the weapon worth your hard work right? Wrong. Shell out $20 real world and you can get a gun that takes the entire in game shop and blows it's face off.......forever. 2. Vehicles. Remember the drive-by I mentioned earlier? You might wanna forget that....because you can't call what you do in an APB vehicle driving. Every vehicle is slow and unresponsive, on average it takes a second before the vehicle will start turning the direction you told it to. And when it does turn, it's like being on a Canadian highway in December! 3. AI. I know handicapped people with better mechanics than this. Park your car in the middle of the road and the whole city is like a Sim avatar stuck behind a chair in the kitchen. 4. Matchmaking. This could be put in both pros and cons actually.... The matchmaking system is very intuitive. It matches players based on in game 'Threat-Level' The higher this level, the better. However, this only accounts for personal achievements. Say you win 30 matches back to back, rockin' your starter rifle. You'll get an impressive Threat-Level. But some chotch who wins some and loses some might get put in a lobby with you, and he paid for his loadout. You stand little chance and the sysytem has no clue.  There are probably more things I could say about APB Reloaded, but at this point....I'm ranting. And you probably didn't even read this far anyway.
2886	1	a	Really good game overall.
8494	0	a	region locked in brazil, meh ps: this game is pay2win af, don`t even install
3174	1	a	Pros + You can do all what you want in this game. There are lots of futures. ITÂ´s NOT Pay2Win, because you can play very well with âSTAR-556 or N-TECâ from the beginning. You can buy also every car with Ingame-Cash or Joker-Ticket. You can also buy R195 modifications for 250 Joker-Ticket.  Cons - The Game needs very high system requirements. ItÂ´s very teambased game. AND lots of cheaters and macro players. 
1775	1	a	Summary: In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter! 
6773	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
3666	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
3874	0	a	It's just bad...
8662	0	a	Not that good tbh
4601	0	a	This game is for the lowest class trash you grew up with. You know the kid down the street who had a rich dad and owned every GTA game? Yeah that guy now plays this game. He was a piece of trash then and he's a piece of trash now.. This game is pay to win. That is not debatable. Stole it's character creator from EVE Online. 0/10
1850	1	a	its good but matchmaking is a bit bad :/
9421	0	a	Hey lets put a help chat where the MOD's totally block everything you say bad about the game....played it for 45 min and they didn't allow anyone to say anything bad about the game.....let's just put it out there. It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....
2174	1	a	Likes to randomly crash, but other than that it's a good game
767	1	a	The game is nice, but in total ITS A PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥
9614	0	a	super boaring game, i dont recommend playing it.
3420	1	a	Worth playing, me and my friends Mike and Tristan play this all the time, a fun multiplayer shooter
40	1	a	Good game -&gt; I Enjoy the design/customizable part the most!;
5392	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.
4031	0	a	Gotta love it when the game's first mission is to go up against people who have RPG's, sniper rifles, and LMGs.........just don't waste your time.
10353	1	a	I really like this game, it's just that it's starting to feel old and I want something more and something new. I can't find a game like this anywhere else and it makes me sad.
5673	0	a	The game wont even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing start up for me 
577	1	a	Fun game to play lone wolf or with a few friends. Long wolf you'll be play with others regardless. With friends communications will help you a lot, which is a given. Unlimited ways to customise your character, clothes, cars, symbols and themes. 9/10 imo
4918	0	a	This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ worthless dont even waste your time â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash â¥â¥â¥ game no wonder why its free its free for a reason
969	1	a	i recommend this game. its like a free gta..
528	1	a	decent.  needs new engine, please g1 I want that bloom back!  community is small but it's alright apart from the cheaters.
2099	1	a	
8283	0	a	bought a car in cash 20euro....the second day 40%sell......don't buy anything!
6985	0	a	waste of time simulator 10/10 would uninstall again
7783	0	a	Going to be honest game used to be good like 2 years ago now its pretty terrible G1 support is also terrible with helping most players and they ban legit players who are better then above average. Played this game since CBT and I personally have felt the ban hammer for 'Suspected use of third party software to give an advantage over other players.' (Note: I have never hacked in this game nor done anything that is borderline considering how much time and money I have spent on it I think it would be stupid to but I am Unbanned now) but to even think they are banning legit players is disgusting. Games not terrible its more the owners of the game and their staff although they take like 2 weeks to release a patch that is literally 'Fixed a bug where you could drop the objective and it will float 5m in the air.' and that is all. Most guns in the game are either OP and kill you instantly or suck and you can use an entire magazine and still not kill someone. Finally the game will have terrible FPS if you dont have a good computer. Bottom line is im not telling you to not give it a try but IMO If I had the choice of starting again in the games current state I would stay clear of it.

10253	1	a	This was very good.  Allowed character customization Sort of like DayZ first person + third person perspective EPIC
2509	1	a	This is the most vile pile crap ever made for pc. Its a virtual sewer if there ever was one. The people in this game are very helpful. And by helpful i mean they will help you  Die and Lose missions by blocking your car or placeing their own vehicle over the drop zone. And great freinds who will kill you as soon as look at you. And of coarse everyone has something nice to say. Usually lots of kind words that happen to have only 4 letters. Any way ... if your head is not in a toilet somewhere go ahead and get this game. its awsome.

8784	0	a	nothing but pay2win and hackers and trolls.
6410	0	a	I played this game back when it came out and it was sold off to another publisher or something like that. I only remember that this game was TERRIBAD and can't believe it resurfaced again like a Zombie with positive reviews. I can't believe it has the BALLS to charge 140$ for this stinking pile. You can get much better games for 10% of the price of this â¥â¥â¥â¥. *coughBorderlands2cough*
7716	0	a	The Steering Sucks On Vehicles If I Turn right 5 Sec later It Turns 
7756	0	a	The concept seems to be 'an MMO-style GTA,' and essentially, it is.  In the beginning, when you learn what the game offers, it sounds like a truly great game, and it can be.  Keyword there is 'can.'  It is *EXTREMELY* difficult to get off the ground. The tutorial missions are near useless, and when you're thrust out in to the game world, expect to lose your first 10 missions. Badly. VERY badly.  If you expect to drive a car with any hope of control, prepare to be disappointed. The time between button-press and steering-response is EXCRUCIATINGLY long.  Driving requires awareness. Video game driving requires anticipation. APB Reloaded driving requires the ability to   PREDICT THE Fâ¥CKING FUTURE.    Maybe you won't have this problem, but I sure did. And getting around without a car is cumbersome and time-consuming (probably because they didn't plan for you to HAVE to play the game without transportation).  All that being said, my opinions of the game not being what you'd call 'good', it *is* a free game. So, my recommendation: Download it when you have a stretch that you're gonna be on your computer for a while, and try it out.  Why? Because you, quite literally, have nothing to lose in this transaction.  Don't like it? No money lost.  I'm not gonna recommened this game, though, since I...well, hated it, but if you have a good enough connection to download the game while doing whatever your daily stuff is, might as well, right?
9019	1	a	I like the Game alot and it is a great way to have fun the crafting is top notch and the ability to go threw the world and get items the only thing that bugs me is my lag but thats expected i would give this game 5/5 great game.
10705	1	a	Absolutely amazing game. Brings the excitement of FPS games back to the genre. I highly recommend this game and it's FREE!
4064	0	a	This game is pay-to-win garbage. It doesn't even have a tutorial so you have to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around for an hour to find out what the hell is going on.

3532	1	a	Is it dead yet?
4023	0	a	This game was honestly horrible in everyway. Hackers among just awful gameplay really made it a horrible game.
9442	1	a	Game has changed a lot, but the old versions used to be really fun and immersive. It's a lot more modernized(microtransactions, pay2win), but is still enjoyable as it has a spark of what it used to be
4020	0	a	This game has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, however, that alone cannot save it. Although the premise of this game is great, and the customization is extremely in-depth, it simply has too many flaws to make it a good game.    The cash shop, or the 'Armas Marketplace' as it is known ingame, completely ruins any and all balance by releasing ridiculously overpowered weapons. *cough* VAS C2 Troublemaker *cough* The weapon mechanics in APB are EXTREMELY broken. Players using certain submachine guns can snipe players at long distance with ease. Also, there are no scopes worth mentioning on sniper rifles, which makes them worthless beyond 100 metres or so. This lack of sniping mechanics is further confounded with the lack of a head hitbox. This leads to, you guessed it, NO HEADSHOTS! This creates even less of a reason to use weapons besides submachine guns, because where you shoot makes no ABSOLUTELY no difference! Not to mention, the time to kill in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly low, you CAN and WILL die in a fraction of a second when a player pops around the corner using a VAS C2. Now that we've talked about the gameplay, we can talk about the community. APB's community is one of the most horrific, hate filled communities I have ever been a part of. Any time I log onto a district, the chat is filled with players endlessly cursing one another out and accusing players of hacking. Which brings me to my next point. Hackers are extremely prevalent in this game, and despite the presence of an 'anticheat' used by Reloaded Productions, it does next to nothing to dam the endless river of hackers flowing into this game. When you're not playing against hackers, APB's horrendous matchmaker will be SURE to match you against players three times your level, armed to the teeth with weapons and armored cars. This shouldn't be a problem, due to the so called 'x threat level' servers. The gold players are supposed to play on the gold servers, the silvers on the silver server, and so on. This however, does not happen. Gold players intentionally drop down to silver or bronze threat level, which allows them to run rampant on bronze servers and completely annhiliate the fresh new players, just leaving the tutorial.   In conclusion, I URGE you to avoid this piece of crap game, unless you're looking for a funny way to waste time, or have a fetish for bad games.
10444	0	a	Crafting, the game. Be prepare to spend hours upon hours of gathering materials to make your own equipment. The story is moot, and the game in incredibly newbie unfriendly.  Be prepared to learn how to do things on your own.
2430	1	a	A lot like GTA, but not quite, it is the best GTA resembled game I've ever played.
8994	1	a	Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.  Warm Regards, MikeN
7308	0	a	peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥
9427	1	a	it is an exelent game and very addictive so if you like fallout this is recomended 
79	1	a	This is one of the worst games I have EVER played. That still doesn't mean it's not fun, because it is. It's a ton. A ton. of fun. APB: Funloaded.
2687	1	a	it is fun but deffinitly is not free to play if you want to actually have guns. they start you out with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ weapons annd the most basic stuff. no more than a rifle a pistol and some clothes, while others are driving arounnd in their 30$ irl money cars with 10$ guns with their fancy clothes that also costs money. not a fun game if you want to play it FREE.
2159	1	a	This game is great for a F2P. It feels like GTA sanandreas except a cops and robbers version of that game.  Pros The game would easily cost money and be well worth it but its F2P  Progressive gameplay gives you a goal to keep playing   you never fill pressured to spend actual money on the game as you can just use in game currency to purchase every   thing you need and want with in game currency. Cons  Ive had some bad experience with the comunity so I just mute everybody. it saves me from having to listen to the pure duchbaggery that people on this game can be It's not just me its quite a large group of people having a disconecting problem it happens randomly you could be afk or in a mission or looking for a mission the game will dc you and you will have to sit throught the long as â¥â¥â¥â¥ loading screens.  My final thoughts on the game is that its a clunky F2P open world 3rd person shooter with a good idea but poor exacution. The comunity is bad and allot of them are whinny and imature but this is just my experience. the game is addicting and can be fun its worth about 20 dollars well worth a try    also people say gta clone I say true crime and saints row jumped off a building and this is the spatter they scrapped off the pavement.
9983	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
6360	0	a	it suck
7943	0	a	--This game is not F2P, you either pay for premium or don't bother--  APB Reloaded is a game that can be lots of fun but only if you buy a premium account...  I used the premium account trial and I had a great time playing as a criminal but when my trial ran out it immediately had huge effects on my game, most of my stuff became unusable and my best vehicle that I put loads of in-game cash into was turned into a pay wall.  This game has awful matchmaking, I was put into multiple matches against people who were three times my level and all they had to do was shoot me in the foot and I would die instantly.  If I was willing to buy a premium account I would probably like this game but the faulty matchmaking and dodgy reports about the developers will keep me far away from this game.
8189	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
6008	0	a	this game sucks lmao
2397	1	a	This game is amazing in every way. I recommend it because it is one of the best shooters out there, lets you customize anything you really want to: Cars, Character, Clothes Etc. If you're into the CoD series, you just might like this game although its not really like CoD, it's fast paced battles with Enforcers, (Cops) Versus Criminals. This game is not, however P2W(PaytoWin), but if you do play it P2W you might have an advantage over other players. This game has been INFESTED with hackers lately, I would not reccomend it Atm(At the moment).  I currently have an R229 Criminal on Colby(NA WEST) The name is SeemsLegitBro
1829	1	a	Fun, free, and easy to play.
8611	0	a	IT NEVER LOADED..................................
3842	0	a	So first off I actually started playing this game 6 years ago, but only connected it to Steam recently so that's why my play time is only said to be 100 odd hours. Now honestly I didn't play for all of those 6 years and for the reasons I am about to cover... The game has some heavy pay to win issues, now some people (usually those who pay actually...) defend the game and say that if you earn enough 'joker tickets' you can buy these OP premium weapons for 7 days. The problem I'd argue is that it takes about a week for doing specific missions known as 'fight club' missions to actually achieve the joker tickets necessary in the meanwhile you are facing off against opponents whom oay for premium weapons and I have always played without paying any money so I can most defintley confirm that premium weapons absolutley out class their standard counter-parts and only after heavy modification after loads of playing time can one even stand on the same level as a premium weapon. Of course natrually a premium assault rifle will still lose out to a standard shotgun at point-blank range assuming the shotgun is being used well as it is not unheard of for a shotgun to lose in this scenario. I have played with the regular weapons then one-day trialed their premium counter-parts and it is very easy to notice the difference.   Another issue is that the community are generenally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, like if you've ever thought a community in a game like LoL is bad then wait till you see APB. But yeah people won't be kind to you. Also this has been massively improved upon (as once this was literally no exaggeration a problem every other match in a standard district) but there is still the occassional hacker that ruins the game. But I am thankful as this is way less common than before.  On the flip-side the customisation is better than any game I have ever seen ever and I do love it. It is incredibly in-depth and you can truly create your own identity, both in your character and vehicle. However once more customisation is better with premium allowing you to obtain a few more pieces of gear that are usually impossible to get due to pricing and also more decals are allowed on you and your gear and vehicles if you are a premium member.  Also I generenally find the combat fun, hit detection can be quite bad. But if you aren't playing against a load peeps using premium weapons, which makes up a large amount of the community, then it is quite fun and skill based. But as I said no matter how skilled you are your assualt rifle will lose out to a premium assualt rifle at almost any range. Except there does exist the odd bad premium weapon.  Overall I wouldn't recommend. Unless like me you love customisation and the game can be very fun, it has a few interesting gameplay features/ the game just feels unique in it's gameplay despite just being a third person shooter. But if you play for free you'll find yourself heavily disadvantaged and will recieve slightly limited customisation options. Having said that the customisation is still truly amazing and it's weird to think that a not so good game can nail one mechanic so much better than any other I've ever seen.

9921	1	a	Great Game Althogh M For Mature Great Just Like GTA I Would Give It A Like :D
8934	1	a	An exelante game for any MMO fanatic. Game that will keep you busy for a very long time with allot of different people from around the world trying to carve their own little place out in the wasteland. Has a couple of bugs now and then but is fixed with a simple relog, and also has a very active update and bug fixing comunity that maintains it. Has a very comlicated HUD but you make it your own. Modular HUD.  After more than 1000 hours on this game, I must say it was nice. It does get very frustrating waiting for crafts to finish, and getting all of the materials but in the end its all worth it. A game that will keep you busy for a very very VERY long time and has so much to offer. Looking at the Single Player content such as NPC's that give missions and places to discover on your own, it has more than 1000 hours worth in it. I have not even covered 1/4 of it yet. PvP is somewhat a battle but you get the hang of it, make sure you got a good build for it though. This game is very modular in allot of ways, from HUD layout, to Charachter Build and Look. You are set free in the Wasteland. Group in a clan, gain a faction, make new friend from across the Planet (Seeing that its ONE Global Server) and Survive. So Carve out your own spot to call home in the Wasteland.  At 1199 Hours in this game I have finally reached the maximum ammount of money that you can have on a single character. 9y99r99b99w. This is through only crafting, trading and selling. Something I am very proud of looking back at now in the game.  As of the Steam 2016 Nominations: I know there are many Titles that can keep you glued to your seat saying that iconic yet oh so white lie, 'Just 5 more minutes' but of all of them I believe Fallen Earth has drawn me in the most. (As an Massive Multiplayer Online Game) Community, Crafting, Setting and just the aspect of exploring this massive world all connected as one server. It was a grind, but all of those grinding memories are oh so cherished. Thank you to the Developers of Icarus Studios, LLC.

3751	0	a	Date was like 2/3 years ago.  I've played this game for years and right at the end it turned into a Pay to Win game with hackers every where.  Im not going to pay 40$ for a Ingame gun...  Since people keep commenting on my Review here is an update to stop everyone arguing with me.  The premium Weapon are Far better like the shotgun has a fixed pattern to its spread so if aimed right it would one shot you. The premium HVR allowed you to run with it when the non premium would not. The premium Car parts gave a boost to you vehicle to allow you to over power non premium users. the list can go on of small things that over time will add up..  I under stand they need to make money to keep the game alive... however I believe it should be kept at a cosmetic level of game play not core mechanic of the game.. not to mention the idea of renting a gun for a week for real money or spending 40$ US to own the gun, Like really I might as well buy another game for that price..   Bottom line is I shouldn't have to be a MLG level of gaming just to compete with some casual gamer who spends 80+ dollars a week to get an over powered weapon/car.
10801	1	a	I remember having people wipe the floor with me as i extremely slowly slid along the ground unaware of how to use the sliding system then having someone whizz by me then being blown up. There definitely need to be more FPS games like this where it doesnt rely on small maps to make it fast paced but having something unique making it really fast paced.  I played this game when its community was booming and it was difficult finding a open game. It was extremely fast paced and that is what made it so good. The class system had a effect on the pace of your experience preventing the heavy classses from going at the speeds of the smaller ones. I would highly recommend this to anyone that can find enough friends to play at once to make a game.   I really hope that there will be some sequel or re-release to get some new players or bring old ones back. Maybe adding some new features.   If anyone actually does read this review or actually looks at this games page i would be greatly surprised I really want this game to have the community it once had.

3431	1	a	3/5 - Great game, ruined by hackers.
1021	1	a	Great F2P
3893	0	a	&gt;play saints row 4 at max gfx and high resolution and goes 60 fps &gt;play this at low resolution with minimal settings windowed and low resolution and goes 10 fps  ...?
5765	0	a	First of all, this game isn't free to play, though if you do play it like it is, you will be very disappointed, because you'll be overpowered by almost every player out there in the game who either has too much money on his hands to splurge on a game or has no life and has been playing it 24/7 for the past 5 years, because that's the amount of time you need to put in the game in order to be on the same level as rich players and actually somewhat enjoy the game, so it's more like Free to Play Like a Noob Unless You Pay Up, One point to note is that the mechanics of the game is subpar. Graphics is average. Gameplay is so repetitive it hurts and is unbalanced to boot.  The pros of the game would be rich customization, but you can't fully enjoy it for the aforementioned reasons.   The conclusion is that the game was made for simply making money and the complete disregard for the community makes it virtually unbearable, so If you're a masochist or dumb enough to pony up the devs or take part in their little schemes for earning the G1C, this game is for you.
8334	0	a	fun at first, quickly turns to total â¥â¥â¥â¥ toward the endgame get it if you want to troll one of the most autistic playerbases in gaming, if you actually want a good time look elsewhere
3479	1	a	Very good game exited for the new engine!
2966	1	a	a great game, lots of costumization, cars, guns, explosions, this game has everything... except jetpacks :(
2407	1	a	This game is one of the best open-world games out there. It is often compared to GTA, but it is so much more than that. It has fully customizable characters and cars, big open-world map, and a social district completely for your customization needs. This game is way better than the way the people on here are making it out to be. It's free, so give it a try. You don't like it, your loss.
7318	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
3302	1	a	I found it to be very fun and enjoyable, the game dose not offer as much (if any) realism as other shoters, howerver its the content and the great custimazability that makes this game so great and highly adicting. If you want to try a new type of shooter with great possibilitys than try apb and find yourself glued to the screen!!!!
1447	1	a	its good game i like this game
10250	1	a	of coruse
7068	0	a	[OLD REVIEW, SEE NEW BELOW THIS Recommended Meh. 6/10. It's not that great of a game. There's constant lag no matter which server you choose to spawn in, and that interferes with some cool sound effects that would be greata otherwise (car engine, car radio, etcetera). The gameplay itself is great, but really, REALLY pay to win. You can't even get a permanent weapon without paying, but that doesn't matter much, because these weapons are cheap, and you DO get one permanent weapon in some early days of playing. The co-op open world sandbox is great. I love driving around competing against other groups with a group of friends while driving around in an ambulance or feeling the pressure when I do the drug mule event when other players hunt me down. Lag interferes a lot with pvp though, just a heads up. [NEW REVIEW, 12/22/15] Oh God... 2/10. It's a terrible game. Do not come to this game looking for a game with the freedom and open worldness of Grand Theft Auto V, for thou shall not find it. Do not come to this game looking for the humor that surrounds Saints Row 4. For thou shall not find it. Do not come here looking for the sandbox flexiblity of Garry's Mod, for thou shall not find it. Do not come here looking for the combat mechanics of Call of Duty, Counter Strike, or any other good shooter games, for thou shall not find them here. Do not come to this game seeking the great community of Reddit, for thou shall not find it here. Do not come to this game with high hopes, for thy hopes will be brutally smashed. Do not come to this game at all, for thine brain shall be spared from having to keep the terrible memories of playing this game. But seriously, do come to this game looking for a great character customization, it's one of the only pros I could think of, and it's quite possibly the only positive aspect of this entire game. Aside from playing it with some good friends of course, but even that's not available to everyone 24/7.
8157	0	a	This game dont have something what destroy this game -this game dont have good match making so you will se 50,49,85 versus 245,200,180 
4935	0	a	So full of W2P items and hackers.  People were openly talking in general chat, about how there are only two ways of enjoying this game:  And i quote directly: 'There are two ways of enjoying this game, either you spend money in the Armas store, or you spend money on hacks'   Enough said.
356	1	a	I am terrible at this game, yet I can't stop playing 8/10 would fight agaisnt rocket spammers again 
2555	1	a	All Points Bulletin, or APB for short.....what to say? It's a 50/50 with me,   This is a great free-roam game, and the ability to make your own character is good. all the different vehicles you have to choose from are great, and the fine details on everything is nice to see.  However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot. Just don't go in with high expectations or you will be disappointed
3860	0	a	I played APB Reloaded when it was in beta, it was a great game and had some cool concepts for both Enforcers and Criminals. Then ARMAS shop was open and it all went to trash, 'Gamersfirst' nerfed the witnessing system to oblivion so its no longer viable for enforcers. Noobs that spend 10$ or more can wreck veterans that have 2000+ in game hours, even if you're silver and supposed to get paired with silvers and bronzes, you'll most probably be paired with rank 255 golds with ARMAS. Just dont play it, its not worth the time nor the effort, it was a good game, yet P2W components â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up totally.   In the other hand, the game concept is fun, yet as I said you're not going anywhere without using cash or at least spending 3000hrs or more.  EDIT: Forgot to say, dont play it please and if you already do, dont spend money on it unless you really like the game, dont give this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs any more money, they dont deserve it.
10245	1	a	not bad..weird as â¥â¥â¥â¥ but not bad,game is kind of confusing only complaint so far at two hours into it
8428	0	a	i didnt like it, messed up my fkin graphics drivers
2251	1	a	good game its just a bit laggy during intense moments for me but ive heard that a ssd fixes that problem (i have a hdd). but apart from this problem its agood game.
10000	0	a	Didn't enjoy the game that much. I think the dev's don't put enough attention on the newer players and focus on keeping their older player base.
388	1	a	cool
547	1	a	decent.  needs new engine, please g1 I want that bloom back!  community is small but it's alright apart from the cheaters.
873	1	a	Lol I never actually played this
3658	1	a	This game... is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. BUT I cannot stop playing it. I guess it's not so bad. I have fun with it even though I hate it. The customization is mind blowing and the broken physics are so bad they make it entertaining.
3868	0	a	Think League of Legends has a toxic community? You haven't seen APB's yet.  Also this game is terrible.
4558	0	a	Hmmm What can i say about APB Reloaded... Well The game is great if there wasent so much hacking lag and general No â¥â¥â¥â¥ Given when it comes to the developers.... They just dont care about the people or game... This game is only for and ever will be for people who pay to win .... Hackers who ptw will Never get banned becuase unless uve payed more then him or have more people who ptw report him nothing will get done.. Free to play people have no pull in the game...Its terrible some of the ptw weapons being super op.. Its just an unfit game for anyone who doesnt want to spent 50+ dollars to win and troll people  2/10 f%*king Disgracefull  Gamers first my â¥â¥â¥ more like Bank account First   UPDATE: 4/10/14  Well im done with this game 150+ hours and im a decent player but its just too terrible, Ive incounterd so many hackers and Such op weapons this game isnt fun anymore Those of you who ever play F.ree T.o P.lay games Please check if its by Gamers First.  Games go to Gamers First to die slowly  Just dont play any games by these people do yourself a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Favor and Dont get frustrated
3254	1	a	Friend submitted support ticket and it was resolved within 30 mins. That kind of response is amazing enough to outweigh any cons of the game, if there were any.
10348	1	a	Great game one of the best! If you enjoy Fallout you will love this game!
6765	0	a	IF you paid or invested a ton of time into it, you can play it. If not be prepaired to face horrible ballance issues and get bullied around CONSTANTLY. Did i mention next to no player physics, no tutorial, no clue of WTF is going on. Maybe im just tired, but it has some serious frustrating issues from the start that make for a agrivating experiance.
1946	1	a	Meh, nice. It has the formula for a P2W game and getting items and the tutorial tasks is hard and making a decal and customising anything is far to limited. Cars and guns are good though. Love playing as my Enforcer mainly because I have done more progress on that one and im still debating whether my Criminal profile should be male or female. Plus, as both a pro and con, there are items that look awesome but are restricted which is annoying like good cars, guns and epic looking clothing and skills. Thumbs up but needs more cheap weapons and everything needs to be constantly availiable with the really epic â¥â¥â¥â¥ needing contracts.
4275	0	a	dude this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
4608	0	a	Wasn't really worth...
733	1	a	Great Game, only problem is You play againist Silvers &amp;&amp; Gold's when your Bronze Rank &gt;_&lt;   Pretty Stupid Match making i could say.
6408	0	a	HOW LONG AGO HAVE THEY RELEASE THIS FRIGGIN GAME AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE FULL CONTROLLER SUPOORT, DAFUQ?... YCKY. WARFRAME CAME OUT AFTER THIS AND THESE GUYS STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR â¥â¥â¥â¥ TOGETHER WTF? NOT EVERYONE CAN PLAY ON A KEYBOARD... THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH BIG HANDS AND CONTROLLERS CAN ACCOMMODATE THIS ISSUE, WHICH MAKES PLAYING THE GAME MORE ENJOYABLE AND COMFORTABLE. PLEASE RP GET YOUR SHET TOGETHER GOD!!!! 
7561	0	a	game started to crash after first launc (
1802	1	a	I broke into a garage, shot innocent people while running down the street, ran from the cops, and then fell off a building and lost everything. Also I did all this in my underwear.  10/10
4675	0	a	Great customization (characters and vehicles) but it's also pay to win par excellence. You'll get owned by people with 'premium' guns permanently - I guarantee it. If you're not ready to pump money in this game then you maybe should look for an other game. It also seems like there are a hole bunch of cheaters playing, who (as I heard) won't even get banned because they buy stuff for real money. The game itself is really good but thanks to pay to win and the many cheaters it's not enjoyable for more than a month or so. Didn't touch it for years because of this.  Oh btw.: Most time I played back in the day I didn't play it over steam.
2198	1	a	Not bad! Plenty of customization and quite a bit to keep you busy. Great gameplay with freinds
8009	0	a	
5363	0	a	This game sucks my â¥â¥â¥â¥
7408	0	a	Alot of potential but awful implementation.  The gameplay is quite fun if you get matched against an even team but machmaking is quite bad in this game it will match you up against higher lvl player again and again wich can be frustrating as hell.  Also the higer lvl weapons are quite a bit better so if your medium to low lvl the frustration can be too mutch. as your against more experienced players that know every nook and cranny but they also outgear you in weapons armor and equipment.  Also the ingame store is the saddest thing i have seen in my life it wil cost you euro`s to rent a bloody gun yes RENT wtf and as most guns are reskins of current guns your paying rent for a skin. But the store is the only way to get acces to higher lvl weapons so yes you can get most stuff ingame it wil take you 200+ hours to get to the good stuff or payup.  Also all the long range guns are way too powerfull an ak like gun does +- 160ish damage the most used sniper in the game does 950 so there are so many that even use it as a close combat shotgun.  Dont even get me started about grenade spam higher lvl`s even get to carry 3 grenades that do way to much damage.  Also this game reward cheesy gameplay as the losing team almost gets no XP, so expect every dirty trick/glitch people know against you.  And last but not least so many cheaters and i consider every change to the gamefile`s a cheat like the widely used tweaks to remove all the textures and shader adjustments to remove smoke, add outlines all so its easyer to spot people. adjusting crosshairs so they have one even if they are running.  and ofc the people with aimbots and stuff.  GamersFirst the company that runs the game has added almost noting since the game came out years ago in reality they should be called myBankaccountFirst.  on the positve side i wish all games had this degree of custumising your looks
10599	1	a	If I gave it a little more play time I would probably enjoy this.
8185	0	a	Honestly, APB: Reloaded itself is great and fun. The game type is entirely unique, in that it's basically criminal gangsters versus lawful gangsters (Criminals vs Enforcers), destroying the city through random missions and the robbery of citizens' belongings by means of ram-raiding shop windows or mugging them on the street. The open world instances are flashy and fun to look at and explore, even if the majority of buildings can't be entered. The game's customization is, and maybe always will be, the best of its class -- if there even is another in that glorious top-tier -- simply because you can make your own theme songs, decals, and more through the in-game editors. Even if you aren't very good at art, you can still enjoy the simplicity of the game's customization, and make complex designs very easily.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because of the company that presently owns it: GamersFirst. Whatever good content they can add is made worthless by one of two means: The slow ranking system, or the simple fact that it's exclusive to the cash shop, making it one of the largest pay-to-wins I've ever played. There's also the major problem of cheaters/hackers, and the terrible security that's presently implemented. Still, I found a way to look past all of that and enjoy the game for about a year, even if the servers rubber-banded every now and then. Unfortunately, that rubber-banding has gotten worse over time, as the servers are simply getting more and more degraded by the second. GamersFirst is incapable of understanding that they need to upgrade these servers, and now the game is in a state where every movement has a 5-second delay, rubber-banding runs rampant, and disconnections occur every 5-10 minutes which won't allow you back on for another 20. GamersFirst does not understand the real ideas behind running a good game besides content, and in that they have ruined the experience of the game completely.  This is not the first good concept they've destroyed. WarRock is another shooter that now belongs to Nexon Europe, and once belonged to GamersFirst. The vehicles in the game are solid, and plays like a free-to-play Battlefield, in its own way. When my friends first told me about WarRock, the first thing they warned me to avoid was the public servers. I asked why and they gave me one answer: hackers. By the time I got that warning, though, I had already joined a public server and saw a flying tank getting destroyed by a glitched helicopter. I quickly left, and played in a private room with my friends, having a great time until the servers suddenly went down. They didn't come back up within half an hour, and we all decided to uninstall the game shortly after.   It saddens me that APB has been ruined by such a terrible company, to the point where I can no longer recommend it. I've heard rumors that Perfect World Entertainment is looking into buying APB: Reloaded from GamersFirst, and I must say that sounds like a far better idea than letting it run on the slowly melting servers it's running on now.
1282	1	a	Very fun game, loads of customization towards your character, cars, guns, and gear. Its open-world and the civilian physics is hilarous. Sometimes I play just to hit people as a criminal. For a F2P, its very good.
9627	0	a	I would quite honestly get a rusty knife, and slowly saw my own arm off, rather than play this game. Then afterwards, I would boil my arm and serve it at the local soup kitchen. This game is god awful, and may god have mercy on whom ever decides it would be a brilliant idea to play it. Dont waste your time.
4274	0	a	It's pretty bad
6413	0	a	THIS IS OUT DATED BY 20 YEARS
320	1	a	GTA without the GTA price.
9207	1	a	Its a game! 10/10
698	1	a	Good game. Fun. May be innapropriate for younger players ;)
7136	0	a	A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of gta online  not worth your time  or your money
6547	0	a	For now im going for not recommended because the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game forces you to create a profile on another site WHERE !!! You cant even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing register !!!!!! So i havent even got to the stupid game :((((
6775	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
6541	0	a	I played APB a LOT back in the day, before it ever arrived on Steam. Now I decided to get back into it to see how things are, and sadly... not good.  APB is a good game. It can be fun with other people. It can also be a rage fest at times,   Regardless, I can't recommend a game that I here crown as the King of Grind. APB has a lot of customisation, its a damn shame that a lot of that is locked behind a massive grindfest. You could pump hours into this game, and still have most of the top tier weapons locked away, or your car customisation slots mysteriously locked with no explanation given on how to unlock them.  APB is a good but heavily flawed game that is good for co-operative play in short bursts, but I can't recommend a game that forces you to grind away it.  It is also a game that is slowly dying. Most of the servers are unpopulated, with only the top grindfest players remaining. Social district tends to have the most population of anything and it is sad to see that the developers have not really done anything to APB other than your low-key fixes and balance updates. Really, there isn't anything new, and it looks like APB will slowly approach its final resting place soon..
5525	0	a	stupid game. so mutch bugs
6303	0	a	Although this came can be fun at times, people rarely play it and its just filled with pay to win players
4913	0	a	Boring and clunky. Games looks average.
2789	1	a	Nothing is more then unique then APB, it has it's flaws, but the game model is quite the experience.
4720	0	a	This game was pretty good I liked the intro to it and the theme was really good, but I didn't like the gory headless horseman event it was pointless and boring. I dowloaded this game because of the cars and fighting, I don't want to carve pumpkins or do any events, it does take time to unlock things on the game so be warned, you will have to have a lot of spare time on your hands. The fighting part and car driving is fun though and the customization options are very wide. It was really fun and enjoyable, although the events were boring.
9055	1	a	Its a good game for you fallout fans its the same story basicly but divided by sectors. it is fully multiplayer just amazing
3429	1	a	totally tubular 
2701	1	a	I recommend this game to all because it has that good gta side and the saints row the third customization to it it is also really fun too your character can be a cop or a criminal you can have your own crew ive seen team joker army and a bunch more stuff so donwload now
7357	0	a	Game has micro transactions. I get thats its free, but microtransactions are the only way to play the game? Really? 
5221	0	a	eh. its like gta but pay to win.
1394	1	a	selling rare pepes please hit up my profile
1956	1	a	An OK game...Not all that impressive because of P2W items and extremely unbalanced matchmaking. The best thing is well, it's free to play you don't have to pay so that's a plus. You could always just hijack store stuff and keep it as low under 2,000 otherwise cops will bust you. Pretty easy money too. Mission I'd probably not play those without having a really good team on your side because most of time they just don't stick together or stick to enemy side instead of your side. Sometimes stupid people too. Some moments you're good at most part, some other moments you will probably most likely to get annoyed, maybe even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because they have a better weapon than you do and they're higher level than you, richer also and there's many veterans that will probably wonder wtf you're doing in a game when you're new. Another issue is Steam WILL glitch implying you are playing a game of APB Reloaded when you quit the game and you have to force shut it down with a Task Manager. I can clearly see why people want this game dead already. P2W ruins it mainly because of OP grenade launcher that practically kill you in 1-2 hits. Some people just claims you hack yet you don't. GG. 3.4 out of 5. Leaning between yes and no on game recommendation, 50/50 neutrality depending on how this game is...
7387	0	a	3 Words can discribe this game Pay 2 Win.. No really it's a P2W game and the weapons they sell are extreamly expensive and as far as I can tell the Devs favor on the Criminal side duo to some seriouse unbalance LTL weapons that take 8 hits just to stun a person but it takes 3 hits with a normal weapon to kill you seems a little on the BS side if you tell me. I would not bother downloading the game
9315	0	a	this is the worst post-apocalyptic rpg i have ever played. play fallout instead of this.
6394	0	a	One of the worst games ever made.
2953	1	a	Good, free to play game! The best customisation ive seen in any game.

107	1	a	APB: Reloaded, a game where Pay-to-win is not optional but mandatory. I have some good and bad points that I would like to share with you but first you may notice my hours on the game don't seem like I have much experience. I can assure you that I have been playing APB: Reloaded for over 3 years now.   Anyway, onto the good points, this game has a wide-range of customisation options for pretty much anything from weapons to cars and everything inbetween (Mostly just cars, characters and weapons though). The wide array of customisation is what seperates the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) styled game from others such as APB: Reloaded.  As for the game itself it has a sort of 'unique' fighting style as a shot from a weapon does the same damage to the foot as it would to the head which draws in a much more casual audience who would prefer this fast-paced massive open world of carnage and mayhem. There are all kinds of different weapons in APB; High Velocity, SMG's, Rifles, Stun guns, Pistols, LMG's and even High Explosive weapons featuring the OSMAW (RPG type weapon) and OPGL (Grenade Launcher). This open-world environment is ideal for the casual gamer who's looking to get a 'thrill' in playing something like GTA, just without the cost.  Anyway, this game can't be all good and fun. As mentioned in my first paragraph, the developers rely a lot more on the money in their pockets rather then upgrading the game a lot faster. APB: Reloaded is heavily pay-to-win which in the end forces you to hand over your money to get something a lot more powerful in-game.   With my personal experiences in APB, they have probably one of the worst Anti-Cheat systems around, also known as punkbuster. Random kicks on innocent players and one of the slowest anti-cheat detectors allows hackers to walk right into the game and play as they would a normal player.  This is where I end, I could go on and on about the bad things that happen in this game but I would prefer for you to try it out, and just a quick warning. It can get highly addictive, incredibly fast.
6304	0	a	I remember when I was a console peasant and I read about this game in Game Informer and it sounded so amazing. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
10230	0	a	Was not fond of it 30 seconds in. Did not even give it a chance, looked like poor mans fallout. HUD way too cluttered right at the start.
7866	0	a	It Is A Game That My Computer Has Problems With.  &gt;:(
409	1	a	this game is like ebola when you get it noone wants to be near you    10/10 Would kill some zombies again - IGN
5938	0	a	Every time I play this game, I feel a tickle in my taint. So I guess this game is comparable to gonorrhea.
1545	1	a	I can not start it op and they say its Running always :( 
7842	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
2887	1	a	A really fun game, have played since the original from Real Time Worlds was released. I would recommend to have a great computer with the minimum of 4 GB of RAM to play this. Apart from this, the sandbox environment of cops and criminals makes anybody happy. Just word of advice, don't play this game if you are easy to become angry.
2882	1	a	Saw butts on a sign and uninstalled.
6708	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
7571	0	a	A glorified, pay to win version of cops and robbers in which to kill someone you have to run around like a madman and throw explosives at anything that moves. also, your guns do as much damage as flicking a pea.
4049	0	a	This game is premium grade-A sh!te. I made a character and was pretty much thrown into a world similar to the outraged chaos in GTA Online with no idea about where I was even supposed to begin. After hours of losing missions constantly to the criminals I decided to make one. I actually took my time with this character to make sure they looked exactly how I wanted them to, and when I went to create the character I was told I was disconnected from the server for an unknown reason and lost all of my progress. This game was a big waste of time, and I would not recommend it to the ones I care about.
4665	0	a	Great game but horrible support and company behind it.
2700	1	a	Nice game
629	1	a	Bought the retail version after a few hours of playtime, REALLY enjoy it, there's no PVE no stupid grinding, just pure GTA style action with some MMO elements, what's not to like ? :D
8477	0	a	if you play have fun going to lag hell , dont recommend
10551	1	a	It just does mom, I cant explain why I gotta go fast.
5304	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.
3826	0	a	I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:  1. It's pay2win. 80% of the people playing have bought premium guns wich are overpowered. This game is just not well balanced.  2. The matchmaking. The matchmaking is totally awful and unfair. It is just not fun to play as a free to player.   3. The Arma's marketplace. Weapons can be bought for a limited use time, character life time, or account life time. Character and account life time guns are really expensive for a single gun. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  However,  if you do have money to spent, and you're not triggered easily like me. This game can actually be fun if you have a lot of friends to play with. Be warned though it's a 50/50 game. And that won't change.
2745	1	a	Yes very cool game!play lot of time!
8077	0	a	Not a good game. Much cheater, nobody to punish them. Glitch and cheat it's all you have to rememeber, people use auto aim and others glitch with game mecanical ( sit on the roof of a car to cancel a a debuff of speed)  COmmunity is very worst , people insult and just hit your car to make annoy you (its bring nothing just loosing you time)  THere is a mtchmaker in game but unfortunally it's the worst i never saw, you fight againt high level and high skilled people so you can't do nothing and you can't progress becasue oyu die every time.
5872	0	a	HATE IT wont load and its glitching like crazy ]:
6367	0	a	.
9848	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
4101	0	a	p2w with unfair matchmaking constant crashing on six core cpu and aim cheaters
3717	1	a	This game rocks and sucks at the same time! But i love it and i keep comin back to kill peeps :P &lt;3 it!
2615	1	a	VERY good customization, anything from clothes to cars to your own EYES can be customized almost infinitely! Gameplay is solid, has very good shooting mechanics and the misson system is just to die for, however the car driving seems to lag for me, (probably my crappy internet), but it is still a very engrossing game, i played 8 hours last night, all in all 9/10, i reduced the score by one since latency issues are a bit to severe even for people with good internet.
2669	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
7853	0	a	One of the best examples of a down right PAY 2 WIN game. Don't let my playtime fool you, I've been playing this game from the day it went F2P.  *Driving is â¥â¥â¥â¥, due to horrible delays, it's do-able but certainly not enjoyable. *Firefights are â¥â¥â¥â¥ due to horrible gunplay, It felt like Fallout3 all over again, see a nice gap you can shoot through? Nope, wall. *Collision is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Car is coming right at you, jump out of the way, it clearly hits the wall, dead. *The community is one if not THE worst community I've ever had the misfortune of being a part of.  The matchmaking/District select... You decide to play APB, soon you rank up to Bronze and feel pretty good about yourself, you look through the weapons list and see some cool Rocket Launchers and Grenade Launchers, and some very powerful cool looking guns! It'll take you weeks of playing before you can get those. You join a nice bronze District and decide to do some missions. Oh, look, 3 enemies. 1 bronze and 2 silvers (which have their own District, the Silver district).  Bronze number 1 has the starting assault rifle, the STAR. Silver number 2 has a Scoped N-tek rifle Silver number 3 has a cool looking Rocket Launcher  Golds (highest ranked) play on Silver servers. Silvers play on Bronze servers And Bronze players (the ''noobs'') can hardly rank up due to constantly being harrased by high leveled weapons.  And than, there's the people who try and get DE-RANKED so they can join Bronze servers. Due to GOLDS not being able to join BRONZE servers, they try and get themselfs DE-RANKED so they can have fun killing some ''noobs'' with their automatic grenade launchers and 1 shot kill modded sniper rifles.    The Devs are lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who obviously do not care about the game itself, and only care about the money. Releasing a new RESKINNED, and I repeat, RESKINNED weapon or vehicle, with new name each week. Instead of trying to fix the MANY MANY MANY MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥ing problems inside the game.  The game is a gigantic Bugfest. I'm finding glitches/bugs I encountered years ago.   See a Bronze with a Golden Scoped N-TEC and call him out on it, expect a ''YoumadcuzUbad''. I'd go as far as to say that the community is worst than that of Call of Duty's. Of course, not everyone, but expect the majority to be complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Than there's the hackers. Hackers everywhere. Every few games, you'll encounter a hacker. Call them out on it? ''YoumadcuzUbad''. While obviously hacking (aimbotting, wallhacking, no-recoil hacking) It's become so common you don't even have to call it out anymore, nor bother to report as I'm sure they don't care either.   I always try to find fun, in games like these. The fact is, you won't have fun unless you pay for one of those indestructible vans, CLEARLY overpowered weapons, you won't get far.   3/10, if you're new and interested in trying APB:Reloaded, go straight ahead, its worth playing at least once, I'll give it that. But don't expect as much as the screenshots show. The people saying that the game is not P2W, are the people who have spent money on it.
9920	1	a	if fallout and some random mmo made a baby fallen earth would be it this game has a lot of amazing things that have been put together but the thing that i love the most is that you could have your wepon on your right hand left hand or if you have two you can duel wield so thats about it thanks for watching
9916	0	a	Had high hopes for this game when I saw it, but some of the little things in the game put me right off within minutes such as, you cannot move your head whilst jumping, the stupid look when you have your fist inside your own gun among other issues. I have only just played the tutorial and I imagine I will have another play of this game and see what I think after another hour or so, but till then, the little things irk me too much. Obviously I am not patient enough to deal with these things, and while I do not reccommend it I believe that others would find it alot more enjoyable than I. I will play again and re-review if I find it more fun next time!
3251	1	a	The customization is pretty cool on here, I believe.
9745	0	a	this game stole my money i paid 9.99 for the dlc and i didnt even get the code , this game will rob you screw it and its devs
3048	1	a	Great game
3378	1	a	APB Reloaded is the best F2P game but cheater destroy the fair play in critical fights. The cheater can activate and deactivate the cheats in seconds. They switch very fast their 'god mode' because they donÂ´t want to be detected and banned.  The game is a third-person shooter with RPG-like character settings.  At the beginning you have to choose one side - enforcer or criminal, which you canÂ´t change easily. The huge variation of weapons you have are impressive and make fights really tactical and hard. Teamplay is really important in APB but lots of players fight solo - including me.  IÂ´ve learned to fight alone against groups but that was two years ago - Meanwhile, I have forgotten it because the cheaters made me angry and i decide to stop playing APB.  I hope that the developers from APB had a solution to detect cheater, why i started a week ago to play APB.  LetÂ´s hope iÂ´ve made the right choice !  If the cheater problem is solved i can recommend hundred percent APB !!!
8415	0	a	APB RELOADED Horrible Community. Useless Game Designers(since beta network issues) nothing more. NO. Uninstall. Shut Down Get rid Of.
6745	0	a	Absolutely terrible balancing, poorly polished, and just not very fun to play. This game had the most potential out of any free to play game on steam, but everything that couldve been was poorly executed. Gunplay is average, weapon balance in this game makes call of duty look like Blacklight retribution. If you have about 60 dollars to drop on this game for better weapons and vehicles, go right ahead and play this game because the best weapons cost about 15 dollars
6482	0	a	I'd skip this one. Its buggy and unbalanced. Great Idea, though, and the character customization is very, very good.
8039	0	a	I loved playing the game for the first few days until I discovered something by dumb curiosity. When the best equipment that is FAR FAR FAR superior to anything you can grind for exists as well as content that is almost needed to have purchased to keep playing at a sensible level, well....I can only recommend this is you enjoy spending a lot of money on a game. Besides that complaint, I can only say that development after beta was dissapointing, but the game is very very fun. I cannot argue with the idea that if the real money guns were available for a stupid amount of ingame currency, I would not be on any other game. But...pay to win. Best of luck out there!
7492	0	a	Wow, snipers don't even show the scope, amazing.
4642	0	a	Was a really bad game, I didn't like it, do not even try it.
9604	0	a	maximum range of assualt rifle is 40meter.... you got sniper rifle? thats 70meter... i quit it and never come back 
10080	1	a	I really like this game xD
8173	0	a	THIS GAME used to be good i havent spent a single cent on it it used to be good....... But there is also one thing holding me back from this game is that there are no australian servers...... Turning and killing people is SO delayed over here i literaly have to press the turning button 3 seconds in advance for it to even turn and the deaths are so delayed its not funny. Gamersfirst if your reading this PLEASE make an australia server or an oceanic server alot of aussies will play this game if you had that.
7282	0	a	Game's horrible. Full of lags, errors and so on. Cheaters are everywhere. This game only got worse after being bought by GF. New company only focuses on getting cash. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.

5929	0	a	played this game for a short while was not impressed at all, lame in game physics crappy car control even worse char control  missions consist of shoot other players...... (which other players will undoubtly own you as they are completely unbalanced matches) out of missions gameplay consists of do even more lame stuff to earn cash to get items   has potential but dont download unless your so incrediably board   also its data hog burns data constantly wheather you standing still or doing stuff  in less than an hour it used over 50 megs  in just over an hour used over 100 megs
3085	1	a	Pretty Good if you get used to it, no real pay2win and alot of options for free players.
3390	1	a	i drove a car once or twice
682	1	a	Gonna love how all the idiots say this is P2W. It is HARD to understand that the paid weapons are just RESKINS of the normal weapons? It even says so in their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing description and on the wiki. Everyone just comes and reviews after 20hrs not getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this game. Funny.  This game is GOOD. It is fun, and brings tons of activites you can do solo or with friends. In terms of PvP, you need strong nerves to play it. If you get slightly frustrated by stupidities outside this game, you will not enjoy APB.   Thanks for downvoting my review, but after hitting that thumb down button go check the wiki for the so-called 'paid-weapons' you are so much crying about.
5473	0	a	Unbalanced pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Until they actually decide to use the rank system to make the game FAIR, don't bother playing it.
8688	0	a	Before I start anything, play the game first, make your own decisions and then come back and read the reviews. Reviewers shouldnt tell you to play or not to play the game, its so the devs (and sometimes the players) can see what is good and or bad about the game.  ________________________________________________________________________________  With that being said lets begin, I will chop this review into 3 segments, in-depth pros, in- depth cons, some issues or insights and then my conclusion. ________________________________________________________________________________  Pros -----  - The game is smooth i was able to run the game on high settings with a PC that I spent $400 on (and all the parts were used as well) if you can sacrifice the graphics just a bit you can run the game at 70-90 fps, with the frame rate dropping only when there's a HUGE row of explosions happening all at once (which is very rare).  - The game is OPEN WORLD, the fact that you can run around causing havoc or if you're a goody two shoes you can silence that havoc, is amazing, there's so much you can do in this game, you can rob random citizens you can crash into a shop window and loot the store, or you can patrol the city streets looking for criminals to arrest, you can drive around recklessly or you can just cruise if that's your style.  - The Choice of preloaded music (while not ALL of it is my taste) really hypes you up when you're driving around looking for that cop to run over, And if that's not your taste then you can upload YOUR OWN MUSIC from your desktop using the in game browser to search for that folder full of music you probably got through illegal means...  - The options, this game is SERIOUS about its customizability, and I mean SERIOUS, not only can you edit the clothes you buy if you wanted, you can customize your car, your tattoos, your characters face, and body in general, you can create your own death song, for when you kill an enemy so they can hear your music mocking them when they just got blown away, there's an awesome market and bidding system that was catered for the player so they can find what they want easily and quickly, and every gun has an unlockable skin you can acquire through achievements or special events that are going on!  ________________________________________________________________________________  Cons -----  - Im gonna start off with the matchmaking, because it is the MAIN reason this game is deterring people away from continuing to play this game. The matchmaking sucks MAJOR OX â¥â¥â¥â¥. players are split into ranks Green, bronze, silver and then gold, each rank having a deeper ranking than the one before. The first time you load up the world and join you are automatically readied up, which is cool and you can quickly switch it off if you just wanted to roam around and see the sights. Your first day in your Green ranked, once a match has started you and your team will fight against another team and guess what, most of the time they are all GOLD, yes GOLD the highest leveled player against a player who JUST joined, and this isn't gonna stop now, no no no it'll keep happening over and over and over again till you quit because you're going 0 and 19 (K/D) if you delve in deeper into the server selection (on the advanced menu, where you can be specific on which server you wanna join) EVERY GOLD, and I mean EVERY, â¥â¥â¥â¥ING, GOLD, is on a bronze server. Its ridiculous, and they purposefully do this if you haven't noticed, the servers are spread out so each rank has their own server so bronze can play against bronze silver against silver and gold against gold, but no they don't give 2.5 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about that and just join in so they can rake up that nice money and achievements.  (more about it here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/357285562482069506/  )  - The weapon system, oh my god, the weapon system. When you first start off you're given this toy assault rifle, not only is it meant to only be able to kill an enemy bronze, but you're stuck with it for most likely your entire play through, you won't make enough money to buy a new gun, which you can only own for 7-10 days UNLESS you spend a huge sum of money to own it permanently, which isn't that bad if you're making a lot of money.  - Game population, doing /pop in the game chat will show you how many people are playing in your US/NA server (last time I did it showed me it was only 300 players playing 300!! not all on one server no they are all spread out with the bronze server ranking about 80 players while the rest 220 are all dispersed into small 10 or 8 player servers)  - Flat our PAY TO WIN/FUN, if you ACTUALLY want to have fun in this game then you need to borrow your moms credit card. or if you can afford handing over your hard earned cash then go ahead, because this game is going to beat you and frustrate you and stress you enough to force you to hand over your cash. you want to get cool guns and cars? Money. Cool clothes? Money. Wanna customize your car to more than SEVEN, YES SEVEN SINGLE graphics to put on your car and or clothes)  - Community, the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥, its cancerous, and toxic, worse than 5-year-old Minecraft kids, worse than GTA V kids, and the entire LOL community combined. they are snobby, unhelpful, bigoted, racist, closed minded, rich edgy tweens and eugenes. if you are paired up against an entire team of gold and you die, god help you your team mate(s) isn't(arent) higher leveled than you (most likely golds) because if they are and you die EVEN ONCE you are going to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on for than entire match because you a helpless new player was killed by a player that probably played this game for years. You are going to get called a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ie' 'noob â¥â¥â¥' and 'fragits).    _____________________________________________________________________________  This game doesn't care about the bugs, or the hackers, or the community, or the game itself either. Its worse than a pyramid scheme. 'Gamersfirst' really should just become EA's snobby son. Regardless of all I said, (and if you actually read all of that then wtf is wrong with you) play the game, create your own opinion and write a review of it and send it to the devs. The ONLY way this game is going to change is by speaking to the devs and getting in contact with them, and just like EA the only language they speak is money, so to do that, the game has to either start DYING OUT which is going to happen very soon unless something changes or if they start losing people who are paying a monthly fee to be a premium. _____________________________________________________________________________

294	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!
4416	0	a	This game is the representation of cancer, ebola, aids, hiv and above all, pay to win. In all seriousness it has a ton of bugs, bad features, poor implementation, bad mechanics, the community is the worst and overall the experience is very, very poor. I would only recommend this game to someone who is only looking for a game where they can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in an open world, because if you are looking for competitive gameplay this is the worst game in the history of open world free to play games. Warframe for example handles the payed features much better because they do not allow you to win over all oponents like you are a 500 pound bodybuilder fighting against tiny baby cats. Overall the game is at all points unplayable, unbalanced, and not enjoyable at all. Please do not play this until the developers decide to actually make something playable out of this so far poorly designed game. The community has been dying for a reason. Wake up you â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
8603	0	a	I played a total of 14 hrs. I would not recommend this game for some reason.  1: you can't permanently keep a gun after buying it with real world money and would only last 10 days  2: gameplay is bad  3:erverybody even your own team can be â¥â¥â¥â¥ most of the time. 
997	1	a	This game might not be perfect, and it might be plagued with issues such as optimization, server performance, hack prevention, terrible matchmaking system (one that relies on a faulty threat level system), and more...  But, it's a game that is unlike any other, and one that has a lot of potential. The customization offered in APB: Reloaded is unrivaled: allowing you to customize your clothing, appearence, car, music, and graffiti as much as you want (within defined symbol limits; premium members [A 10$ish fee] get more layers to use).  I've played this since before it was APB:R. It's been about three long years (or, technically, like two years and like three months). It remains to be seen if APB:R will last. Management has not been kind to the game in the last two years, despite their attempts. The newest management claims to be more dedicated to fixing the game... that remains to be seen. There's a lot that needs to be done.  But if this game does get its â¥â¥â¥â¥ together (and I really, really hope it does), it could easily become popular again.   It's just got a long way to go.    Still: Give it a shot. At the very least for the customization. The game will seem bad from the get-go (the learning curve is steep and the community is awful), but try to stick around.
5787	0	a	APB... a P2W game where losers who don't have any skill in games gather to buy weapons that give them advantage so that they can feel a little bit better about themself when they destroy someone with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pistol/smg in few hits... that about sums it all up i guess, nothing else needs to be said about this game besides it not being worth your time, don't worther downloading it because you will be disappointed very quickly and you will regret ever being born into a world where this game exists, id rather watch my windows update itself rather than play this game.
2329	1	a	it like GTA only some players can be cops the other criminals you can steal cars find and use weapons it awesome
7005	0	a	amazing character creation but the game is ughghgh
1683	1	a	Not bad for a free game however as soon as you start the game you instantly feel the pressure of microtransactions.
7058	0	a	This game leans on, advertise's, and preys on those who get dragged in to character building. A bunch of Youtube trolls covincing me a broke â¥â¥â¥ game has potential because they were paid to promote the character creation 'the only unbroken part of the game.'   Yet still, you have to pay to unlock a crap ton of designs... unless your spend hard earned hours to get some decent items at the bottom of their list.   Free to play or pay to win... That's the name of this game.   To top it off, there are major glitches in the game that won't allow your gameplay to be satisfying or many times enjoyable at all. Why waste a minute to 100 hours of game play guaranteed not to work properly 70% of the time? My final straw at my final hour of game play, was not getting any credit for one of my best battles in the game. That doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you are trying to earn in game money so you don't have to dish out 100 dollars for items, it really will tick you off.  After this review, you can consider downloading it and find out for yourself... GTA 5 is out, so not really a point in investing on a lesser copycat of the GTA legacy.  Over all, this is my official rating for APB Reloaded:  ....................../Â´Â¯/) ....................,/Â¯../ .................../..../ ............./Â´Â¯/'...'/Â´Â¯Â¯`Â·Â¸ ........../'/.../..../......./Â¨Â¯\ ........('(...Â´...Â´....

31	1	a	I've decided to revise my recommendation.   This game is fun.... When you're winning, when you're losing you really just want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing murder and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the other team.   Be prepared to get called names like: hacker, noob, buy weapon â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, macro â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, wallhacker, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ucker, neckbeard virgin, no-life unemployed â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, rich â¥â¥â¥ whitekid (guess that's an insult now?), ponyfag, genderbendending-â¥â¥â¥â¥-sucking-ultramega-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.

No hit reg, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ machanics, dumb pay to win guns, terribly optimized, cheater rampant, you wont be competitive enough with the losers who try their asses off abusing broke game features until you have put at least 500 hours into the game and gotten what should have been starter guns. Many of the 'best players' have been aim hacking for months if not years, and use the game as a platform to boost their ego. The developers have run this game into the ground and are milking what little money they can from it until even the nolifes with 10,000 hours realize this game isnt worth playing anymore.
5898	0	a	It's weird â¥â¥â¥â¥ coz you spawn in and dont no what to do, no objectives or anything like that
30	1	a	Its cops and robbers meets gta, fun stuff.
4455	0	a	it's awful
1153	1	a	Do you want aids? How about cancer? If so, download this game IMMEDIATELY! Kids will hackusate you all day, and will rage at you for doing something you are supposed to! This game has all in all made me love every gaming community so much more, just because the community in APB sucks so much! Thanks, APB!
3086	1	a	this game is really fun i you can make your car make your own chacter you can mug people theres drug missions i mean the game is like saints row dont listen to any body that dosent like it they might be gay im just saying you can have clans gourps and â¥â¥â¥â¥ oh whatever you do dont pic cop its not that fun lol i made my chacter as a old asin guy thats fat and whereing just his underwear lol
5853	0	a	CAN you make a game that start up faster not that takes 10min to start up

6740	0	a	i cant even play this game my server doesnt work
131	1	a	With so many hours in the game, I decided that today I will give my conclusion about the game. As you might know, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is an open-world MMO third person shooter in which two sides, the Enforcers and the Criminals are fighting for control over the city. In my entire gaming career, I haven't seen a game that offers this much customization. From creating symbols like camos, tattoos and logos, to fighting in districts such as Financial(a close quarters combat zone city) and Waterfront(a district mostly for snipers and such), APB Reloaded offers a great experience. Although, bare with me, there are some downsights such as: -Progression will take a long time. It's more like griding if you're the type of guy who cares for the level and the reward. In this case, if you want to spend some money, I recommend Premium. With Premium, you have around 90% more xp and money. -Another thing about Premium is that it allows you to add symbols to your body or clothes up to 50. With f2p, you can add only 3 symbols. -Matchmaking. Oh my god, the matchmaking...  Get ready to fight against maximum threat level enemies. This is still a major problem of the game, since launch. -Some weapons might be overpowered, but there are also weapons for f2p players that are op as well.   Overall, if you are willing to spend some money in the game, I definately recommend it. Playing with friends will bring a much better experince, as any multiplayer/co-op game.
5711	0	a	not good its not what you think 1/10
2606	1	a	Award Winning Rage Simulator - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 - 2014  The classic Cops versus Robbers. Create your own music, create your own logos and design your own clothes and cars. Customization keeps this game alive and a wide selection of arsenal from stun guns to rocket launchers keeps it interesting. The community ranges from the underage to your average manchild. Lots of passion and lots of hate.
1195	1	a	This game is great fun when you are just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing with people. The actual core gameplay is abysmal.  My advice is try it for yourself, make a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking character, and go ram people in their little ricer cars. Endless fun.
5726	0	a	APB:Reloaded is right under the definition of Pay to Win and Greed
4590	0	a	This,Game,Is,HORRIBLE!
1164	1	a	Absolute awful excuse for a game. Huge disadvantage set against beginners as max rank players are still able to play against them. AI is simply dreadful and driving any car is a monumental task. 0/10 would deffo not play again
7618	0	a	THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE DO NOT PLAY
4269	0	a	This game is fun and all, it's just that there's so much that could be fixed. There's way too many hackers in this game and the developer's just made an automatic ban system to ban the hacks that are known to the system.   Also let's say that you've played 6 missions in a row, won them all, great stats &amp; all that. Your next mission can cause you to quit the game entirely because of bullsh!t game mechanics killing you, enemy team teaming up and playing the game way too competitive or just get tickled to death by a nano or whatever.   I've had so much fun in this game but now it's just like tip of a pen that's running out of ink. No more ink = No more fun.  I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends unless they've played it and can handle or have experienced utter sh!t mechanics f*cking you over and over again.  If there wasn't any customization in this game i would've never spent all the hours that i have now.
583	1	a	This game is so bad!
4494	0	a	I've had more enjoyment being on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ discord servers than playing this game.

794	1	a	Fun, free to play, Cops and robbers! Monthly challenges and good atmosphere.
9732	1	a	a nice fun game kind of like fallout 7/10
1149	1	a	Great game
2484	1	a	This game is like a Free GTA, plus more
1365	1	a	43/100
432	1	a	Totally awesome mmo that looks and feels like grand theft auto!  There are two diffrent sides! Enforcers and criminals.. I have only tried criminals..  as a criminal you are able to mug people and do ram thefts ( Smash cars into shop windows and sell what is behind the glass! )  There are also missions where you have to be in a team to complete it! 
9245	0	a	Just play Fallout 3 instead.
9874	1	a	good, deep, and long playing game u cant get boring !!!!!!!!
7615	0	a	every time it launches the game keeps on saying reinstall so when i reinstalled it still didnt work
1363	1	a	Multipayer Grand Theft Auto, though not as epic as GTA its a cool copy.
7613	0	a	this game sucks
5128	0	a	Too much hackers.
6266	0	a	Played it.. sucks. Too many things happening, crappy controls, ugly graphics.. not worth 'Free to Play'
4524	0	a	THE GAME IS OK,BUT I PERSONALLY DONT RECOMMEND APB RELOADED
6335	0	a	I hate this game. Random nonsense.
10393	1	a	This game is amazing, lots of crafting, lots of pvp, tons of customization. To me it's one of the exceptions that is not a pay-to-win game
4384	0	a	Very laggy, specially when i drive with a car... Should fix lag then i will press like.
5171	0	a	while the game is semi enjoyable, it is comletely and utterly Rekt'd by Pay 2 Win Contents and makes playing the game pointless and not worth the effort,  if you got money laying around your house / burning a hole in your pocket, i guess you can try this game, but i personally would rather give the money to a charity then pay for any DLC for this Game, or ingame item as the only way to stand ANY chance against other players is BUYING DLC's / ingame items.
8044	0	a	This game is nearly dead... Only a few hardcore players left plus the server latency makes this game impossible to play (completely ignoring the p2w aspect).
157	1	a	If you want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up a town, this is how you do it in crappy style for free GTA action!
2735	1	a	The best MMO shooter ive ever played! Honestly the game is mostly about customization! If you like amazing games then play this!
8563	0	a	I download this game to find oh i try to login and nothing happens,i click play and is acts like its gonna play then the browser closes. THIS GAME IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ OF A WASTE OF TIME!!!
5384	0	a	It's horrible
984	1	a	I Recommend this game to others because it is a fun faction game where you get to have more freedom to how you customize your cars and character than you do in GTA, and as in the name of the game, All Points Bulletin, ranking is eveything and allows you to unlock new cars, clothes, emotes, and weapons.
10239	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
724	1	a	A british person told me to get this game. I deleted it shortly and cut off all communication with the british person and his associates.
712	1	a	community sucks lol, not worse than LoL [League Of Legends]
4740	0	a	When updating this game my disk usage is at 100%.   this program is 7GB of adds and background progams running at all times.    10/10 background apps
7152	0	a	region locked in brazil, meh ps: this game is pay2win af, don`t even install
5432	0	a	GTA 4 wannabe game without the polish- effectively just a turd. There litterally is no purpose in the game, microtransactions. Not worth the 10$ in bandwidth to download it!
2632	1	a	GTA Online with 100 people per server? Oh God Yes!
112	1	a	If your computer doesn't have 8GB of RAM or more, don't bother installing APB. The constant FPS drops will only frustrate you as you die again and again because of them. Also, this game has an incredibly high learning curve. And don't let district chat fool you: There are not as many cheaters as you think (Maybe 1 or 2% of the population cheats, and teamwork can easily destroy them). Once you get good at this game, it becomes addictive, but the server issues can cause that addiction to break. Also, do not play alone. Get your friends in VOIP and the game becomes so much better.
1250	1	a	it's fun try itr out
3986	0	a	Bad matchmaking, sucking playing. The only thing that was good was the clothing customization
7552	0	a	So let's get this rolling.  This game is addictive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ due to being just so much fun at the lower levels but when you progress your threat changes and you will be placed with much harder opponents. The problem is there is no required level for this threat, meaning low level players can reach the highest threat level and then they are for the most part â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. You face enemies that have so much stuff or spend real money on the game that you just get face rolled.   Which doesn't help the match making, that's broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥. At late game you get placed into such unfair matches that it releases the devil inside you. Placing you in games with unbalanced amount of players or threat level. We were two silver threat levels playing against 2 highest level gold threat players and being facerolled.  Then there is the problem of Pay 2 Win. This game has the most OP Pay to win system I have ever seen. You can buy the max level guns and items at any level, meaning you get players just owning you at lower threats and levels. These guns can be obtained (Sort of) at the highest level but just think for a moment, low level players with end game guns....  Now for servers. The servers are for the most part fine, the problem is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way the game uses the servers. Almost everything is server side, so lag? Tough â¥â¥â¥â¥. You're going to crash and backtrack the whole time, also the server side thing doesn't work for international players as they have delayed â¥â¥â¥â¥ing everything. Delayed controls on vehicles, delayed hit detection, delayed death and damage. Making the game feel like a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The Weapons in the game are for the most part good except for the OP Premium guns that are sold on the market. The guns expire every 10 days and they don't cost a high amount but the problem is that the Guns you pay â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money for also expire, although the period is 30 days instead of 10. So when you come back after taking a break from the game, you'll find out that you have no weapons and have thrown more money at the game to unlock those weapons that are required to even win matches.  The game's customization is simply amazing, the company that owns the game host events for artists to create new works of art for the game and if they win they get allowed to sell it on the premium store, but the problem here is you have to pay to be able to make anything. That's right, you have to pay for fonts, icons, decals and much more to be able to make something. Anyway to skip that part is to buy vehicles or clothes that are on the market and have been customized. Lastly there is the way this game makes you rage, with the lag and the pay 2 win style, the most anoying part is when you die, you get played a taunt from the enemy that can be really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anoying. This game has made me rage so much on my friends that we stopped playing it.  In the end, I wonder why I even played this game for so long.
4541	0	a	this game got annoying just to download.some stuff i dont get why we need it.plus when i played it it got boring so fast
10405	1	a	Come Play Fallen Earth I used to play WoW, then I grew up.. Melee is a good way to find me shooting you in the face! If you love to craft and build a character then Fallen EArth is for you. Lastly this is a ! sever game so no hiding, active GM at alll times. Exellent Community of gamers also. Come get some I freaking Dare ya! Edit : No active GMs, game is very much alive, still a vast world to explore. This game requires a high intelligence, reading, thinking and a high amount of patience. Free too play not Play to win and that is always a plus!
8909	1	a	You like: - complex crafting - open worlds - classless character progression - postapocalyptic setting - manual targeting  You don't expect: - a very colorful cheerful game - a set on rails progression - next-gen graphics  If this fits to what you like, then you will most likely like this game. The crafting is great, the graphics are in some ways not so good (character animations), in some ways average (character models), in some ways really nice (for example having a huge view over the open landscape during a sunset).  It's definately not for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot and played it a lot. The community is friendly and helpful too. There are a lot of factions, an ongoing storyline, and you often have 'what is behind that hill' moments. And Fallen Earth lets you find out what is behind that hill. There are no invisible walls (except that you can't enter water, of which there is not much to begin with).  I think the game is very relaxing, when you ride over the open landscape and look forward to have your next crafting items finished (crafting can be done while you are offline or doing other stuff), and at times intense, when you are stuck in a cave full of spiders and slowly running out of ammo.

8119	0	a	A great way to get a headache.
8166	0	a	I've put a few weeks into this game.  The missions are good and varied. The customization is pretty decent as well. Though, a LOT of customization options are behind a pay wall in the ARMAS marketplace, which is overpriced as â¥â¥â¥â¥. The combat comes down to gear. The Meta is spam and pray. SMGs, Assault Rifles, RPGs, and grenades. Being outgeared is a common issue. If one person has a better gun than the rest of your team your team is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Hit detection isn't pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, getting hit behind walls and cars is common.  I wouldn't recommend this game for anything but the customization. That's the best part of this game, and it's a grind to get anything worth customizing.
8777	0	a	TL:DR - You must be a masochist to take this game seriously.  Still a terrible shooter. Somewhat fun for the veterans, just the new pay2win guns make it hard to be enjoyable. Not to mention the hackers. There's an average of one or two per team on Fight Club, at weekends. Don't know about the action districts as I hardly play them, but it's safe to assume they are there as well. It's a game adored by hackers for some reason. G1 should legalize wallhack and everything to level the field.  Grind is less terrible than most F2P games, kinda of goes fast if you are dedicated. But it's hard to raise credits to buy anything, since the payouts for missions or the fight club are next to abysmal. Obviously there to help selling premium subscriptions/premium stuff.  To summarize, you must be a masochist to install this game and keep it, to take it seriously. Believe me, I was one of those maschists that wanted to have everything the game could offer back in 2011.   You may have one or two fun matches, then it's a neverending streak of awful matches that'll probably end up with a broken mouse or worse in a fit of rage. There isn't a friend I met in the game who doesn't have one of those nerd rage stories.

5743	0	a	I made 3 characters, 2 of them were Criminals, 1 of them was a enforcer. When i played the game i would play with one of my criminals more often with my friends, every time i did i would always die from a higher level player. Me and my friends never won a game, one of my friends decided to buy a weapon with real money way better than the rest of us. And we still got rekt. I dunno why the developers of this game dont make better matchmaking and servers with low levels. Although when i played with my enforcer, i found a group of hackers and i joined them and had fun. For the first time in APB Reloaded i had fun. Then i realized that the only way you can be able to actually play this game is if you are willing to give up your hard earned cash or hack the game.

9150	1	a	Truthfully, I had a great time with this game. Sure it had that lingering Pay to Win idea on it, but you could do okay without paying a cent. While this game has been replaced with Fallout, I can't take it out of my library simply due to its nostalgia factor it has.
8431	0	a	LOTS OF SCAMMERS. 0/10 would never play APB again
10330	1	a	play this awsome game 
6602	0	a	Awful game. A lot of glitches to exploit and matchmaking is just awful. Let's not forget the game breaks almost every time you start up so you have to repair it constantly. When I first started playing the game I thought it was pretty good, but the glitch exploits like standing on a moving car and shooting rockets so you don't have a chance protecting the vip started getting old. Also people not in the misson ram and flip you so the people on the other team can kill you.

5085	0	a	nothing change
1063	1	a	APB has to be of the biggest love-hate relationship games I have ever played.   First of all I can say after all the time I've played, this game is not meant for the hardcore gamers because rage will be induced within 35 seconds of starting a mission. The guns are overall balanced (to a point) but almost everytime a new reskin of a gun comes out it is exremely overpowering. The community is...... rough around the edges but mostly fun to play with and against. Customization in the game is fun aswell if you have a creative side. A lot of people can say it's bad and horrible but from my eyes it is still a fun game if you don't take it too serious. Just have fun and don't let the trollish players try to act better than you.   
6096	0	a	I get the game thinking it would be good, but there is no matchmaking to make the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ fair. I get killed by â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Prestige 5 Enforcers and I still have all default weapons and they have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing RPG's, Overpowerd Shotguns, Mg's, and Snipers making the game Unplayable unless you becone a enforcer but where is the thrill of stealing and commiting crime?

5361	0	a	This game has a lot of good ideas, but it also has a lot of bad ones. To keep it as short and simple as possible, this game is very unforgiving, especially to newer players. Prepare to spend several hundred hours competing against max level gold ranks with pay 2 win guns who are organized, probably with voice comms. After you manage to learn to cope with that (assuming you don't quit first) you might ascend to the point of being capable of enjoying this game.   Or just play another shooter.
6021	0	a	Bad game you need actual money to buy guns worthless game
7779	0	a	Piece of crap don't get it
6950	0	a	No, just No. Dont don't do it. Hell No.  Games going nowhere fast.  New pay2win gun every other to few months.  Only play fight club. Rest of the game is a repetitive driving item pickup simulator.
10586	1	a	This game is just all fun around awesome. I was a huge fan from the first Tribes game all the way up to this one. Give it a go!
1314	1	a	This is a sandbox game close to GTA. Lots of this to do. Like kill a randomer. rob a car. Jump of a building. An endless variety of things to do. So click that install button. It might take a while to load but its worth it. And for those peeps who love making characters you can make a character. Choose from criminal and enforcer. Get better weapons and clothes and Rule your World!!!!!!
9816	0	a	i dont even remember playing this lol
1472	1	a	Give it a chance,dont write bad reviews about it if you play for 1 hour  *Please fix the achivements in steam,they are bugged*
5202	0	a	normal agains cheaters game, best vs cheater game you can find.
4955	0	a	Worse game ever, they don't even give me a chance to learn the tutorial, got knocked out trice at spaw point, worse worse worse I hate this
10322	1	a	Fast-paced, fun, and definately intresting. This game provides many elements and game styles that most newer games lack. This MMO is a must play.
8398	0	a	i can not sigh up
4036	0	a	A completely different rig and 3 years of time, still no 'new engine' (announced 2013). Still hard-locking my PC and forcing me to restart... On a completely new PC...     *I will admit, it is a fun game to watch streamers get mad at people blatantly hacking when the devs are too busy banning kids for swastikas, boobs, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ decals on their cars/clothes.
6817	0	a	Servers keep going down due to ddoser been hours and days its been happning. There staff cant do crap about it. The company is to cheap to get real ddos protection or better hosting and i think theres a virus in the game due to reports and some one got there credit card stolen. I loved the game but you cant even play and there company wont do anything about it. Plus the games pay to one hit some one basicly.  Tiggs Sept. 6, 2015, 9:15 p.m. (6 hours ago) 9:14 PM CDT: We're restarting Social District.   If you see a problem with any districts, please reply below with the district name, and a brief description of the issue.   Tiggs Sept. 6, 2015, 9:27 p.m. (5 hours ago) We're going to do a restart, the districts didn't like some things we changed.   Tiggs Sept. 7, 2015, 12:23 a.m. (2 hours ago) I know it's frustrating for you all, it's just as frustrating for us. We have been working on this since yesterday. Right now we're putting more protection in place to see if that helps.  Tiggs Sept. 7, 2015, 12:36 a.m. (2 hours ago) Well you had DDOS protection earlier this year and it worked well, so what changed?   Little script kiddies got smarter?   They blame other people and cant even fix the promblem themselves even indy games have better protection than this garbage.
2308	1	a	a very fun game of cops and robbers, sometimes frustraiting with the pay-to-win method of the game but its fun all over all teamgame.
7401	0	a	Worst game ever 1st lagg 2 errors don't play it we just want to fix the dam laggg in the server is that so hard !!!!!!!!!!
6798	0	a	A great game with a super awesome amount of customization. However the pay-2-win model ruins most the game.
2012	1	a	Similar gameplay to GTA but with a little better competitive plays. Though the bad side is that low rank player can get to match up with higher rank opponents
8524	0	a	here's a better idea; how about you make your game actually worth playing and fun instead of a boring â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the same recycled â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t missions over and over again?   also another tip; fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, it runs like dog â¥â¥â¥â¥, even on high end PC's, what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do you expect out of a xbone version? to make it even more un-enjoyable? i gurante it won't even hit 30-20 fps.   this is why your game is dying,you know you're only doing this â¥â¥â¥â¥ to make more money, and to top it off, this really shows how little you give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you're own game, because if you can release and port an xbone version of this garbage, then you can make a fully functional â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, G1.
288	1	a	Its a great game. Except for the hackers. Get rid if the hackers completely, and it would be alot better.
302	1	a	another great game destroyed by hackers
472	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
3843	0	a	This game has some good ideas, but poor execution. Whilst the ability to customise your character and vehicles along with themes and other things are very nice and have good variety, the controls for the vehicles are poor and tend to feel sluggish. Other problems that hinder it are poor mission opponent matching with it most often resulting in overpowered experienced people against newer, less well equipped people. This also is shown when a Gold Rank player is left to pay on a Bronze level server even when they should not be allowed to since they are far better skilled/equipped than what the server is designed for. Bronze should be for Bronze only, Silver for Silver and Gold for Gold so as to issue the best matching. Another issue that is prevalent is the way characters ranking is scored, quite often I will go Gold Rank after having a good few rounds. However, this will put me against other gold rank people who are leagues ahead in equipment and skill and leave me feeling frustrated as I lose due to being put against an opponent that is clearly too high a skill level for my own skills. Also seen whilst playing is the way the pay to play aspect causes imbalance in equipment levels. Whilst I do want to pay toward keeping such an interesting game alive, I feel it would be unfair to the other free to play players as I would then gain access to guns and equipment that are far better than anything F2P can access without having to grind multiple days worth of time to get close to having something similar. This is a clear example of Pay to Win. Finally, and most importantly, along with being the worst point against this game, there are just too many cheaters that uses hacks on this game, it's a well known issue but in the whole time playing this game, nothing has been done to stop it. Too often has it been the case I've gone to verse a team of criminals that quite clearly have players that are using hackers to boost there accuracy or take less damage when shot. This is quite obvious when you are two shot killed by a shotgun or pistol more than 100m from your opponent or open fire on said opponent first but discover that even after multiple direct hits they will kill you in three shots.  Overall, a nice concept with some good ideas but poorly executed with too many bugs and hackers.
3075	1	a	cant start it 
8339	0	a	Everyone is a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and the missions are not understandable. And the animations are horrible. DayZ is better then this and Dayz sucks!
4030	0	a	Rife with aimbots and pay to win, it's unfortunate that those rather large issues are in the way of what could be an amazing game with all the levels of customization present. The grind is also approximately double what it should be. 500 hours will not even get you half way to the 'good' gear, unless you're subscribed.  There's an ongoing joke that 'GamersFirst' is actually 'MoneyFirst' because of their policies and inaction on issues in favor of monetizing strategies involving power and chance with the store.
10658	1	a	The game is so fast paced. If you get a kill it is SO much better than any other FPS because it its so hard to kill someone. The best game mode in my opinion is CTF.
4894	0	a	The game froze on me before I got to do anything and said I wasted a huge amount of time on it. Rating- -60/10 60 hours really?
1241	1	a	the game itself is great and one request from this low-spec and low internet data budget person  -please make server on singapore or filipine or indonesia , so i (or even we) can play with small and more stable ping and make the game fun to all  even though that is the only trouble i have on this game , i still recommend this game to you guys   
1277	1	a	Fun game totally recomend for RPG players !
7986	0	a	The handling and mechanics are clunky, I gave it a try because APB made some noise when it was announced back in the day, now I understand why this version is free. Though there's a lot of interesting initiatives (like a software that lets you compose tunes... in the game), all in all it feels slow and awkward. Don't waste your time on that game.
1841	1	a	Outstanding!  -RiotJones July 20, 2012
1594	1	a	what a spiffing experence 10/10!! 
4453	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME
10118	1	a	Downloaded.... few minutes later. Yay! about to play the game , woops new updated, downloaded... downloaded... downloaded... meh uninstalled.  WASTE YOUR TIME SIMULATOR 2015 10/10
8416	0	a	It's a pay 2 win 0/10  good guns 7/10 nice cars 5/10 over all 0/10  Always get matchmake against a p2w and its not cool
8132	0	a	Bad staff, and a game that's 70% problems
2952	1	a	Cool!
3358	1	a	cool
5510	0	a	I'd rather whatch Boku no Pico, The full series instead of playing this game that is more that just Pay 2 lose. WHICH IS VERY SAD. Many Pros got banned beacuse noobs report them as hackers.The company is awful, why even if ebola and aids had a baby it would be better that the company.Dont ever get this game, Why even my game crashed many times and i had the 5th latest GeForce grapics card. I swear this game shouldnt even be on the founders dream/ so screw this game.  (If you dont know what it is its about a anime girl with a d1ck) 
9905	1	a	Fallen Earth has ups and downs, in my opinion. It has a massive world, with lots of different choices.  And some of the downsides are things like all the good armour looks like it just hopped out of an 80s movie, and you have to be perfectionist careful to level up properly, or else your entire character is doomed.
3221	1	a	this game is realy fun so i will give it a thumbs up the only down sides to this game is the 50 minute time it takes to load and the lag
8846	0	a	I've wasted too much money on this game. Don't consider downloading it, even if it's free. It's completely pay to win, bad engine, bad service, bad company everything is bad, except the customization. 
3483	1	a	GTA ONLINO FOR LOW PC! NICE GAME THX
6359	0	a	  you cannot enter to the game, (to enter you need be liker the facebook page, but, the facebook page is fallendown)
8285	0	a	Don't bother.
9527	1	a	this game is an epic adventure/survival game that will eliminate all other free to play games on steam. most defanantly worth getting it. Especialy because its a free to play game.
8856	0	a	This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.
1901	1	a	Criminals VS Enforcers the only thing missing is being able to rob banks with your buddies or put down criminals with them.
9045	1	a	this is a very fun game remindes me of fallout and is sweet for a free to play
1322	1	a	hours of fun customizing cars and outfits aswell as lots of fun killing and driving through the streets running over pedrestrians
9406	1	a	it looks fun but tell me is it fun cause i dont know 
6512	0	a	Dont get me wrong this is a fun game. BUT WAY too many hackers on here i still play it but it gets frustraiting when you get killed over and over.
9584	1	a	PLAY IT! NOW! ITS AMAZING! DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD COMMENTS! GET IT!
6403	0	a	Can't even launch
5700	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.
8306	0	a	I enjoyed this game when I first loaded it. It has great graphics. Great controls. Takes a bit of time to get used to, but once you do, it is great fun. The problem is the community. And this is not a one player game, so you are forced to play 'with the community'. The community in question is horrible. They kill their own team members. Evidently, you aren't supposed to go for objectives until the enemy is right there. Never heard of such a thing. And if you do, your own teammates kill you. Which I can get over. No biggie. But they are RUDE. From their mouths, to how they treat one another. Disgusting behavior. And after I saw the garbage that was in the game, and was treated like crap, I became the garbage which I regret, and went to their level. So although the game itself is fun, the community certainly isn't. And since you have no choice but to play with the community, as it's not a 1 player game, you are stuck, and this makes this game not recommendable.
3988	0	a	Terrible. Stay away. Not even remotely as good as it looks, not even as good as it was before it went to hell and then F2P. I played it long before it went F2P and not all the time I played the F2P version is recorded on Steam. Pay 2 Win cash shop policy and more often than not infested by hackers, and even if nobody hacked it would still be camp 2 win.
543	1	a	APB: Reloaded is not your typical Open-World Sandbox TPS, with over a thousand+ way's to customize your character, vehicle, guns &amp; more APB: Reloaded really set's the standard for F2P Open-World Sandbox games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly reccomend that you do. This game will bring you hours upon hours of enjoyment. I'll admit that when your first starting out it may be a little bit confusing but if you need any help just simply check out the Guide's section on the Steam Store or go search some stuff on YouTube.
674	1	a	Good game but u need to be smart to play
5097	0	a	Couldn't get into it, seemed like such a cool concept. Wasn't for me.
1086	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
10406	1	a	p2w much, but overall a fun game, especially if you join a guild lots of farming, pvp, 7\10
6013	0	a	Bad game, pay to win.
10746	1	a	Great example of a pretty okay game ruined by stupid people. About 5% of the community actually knows how to play the game, and those guys are usally on the other team. EVERY ctf match ends in 4 minutes with a score of 5-0. Still pretty fun every once and a while but i wouldnt take it too seriously.
10310	1	a	great game
7280	0	a	could'nt figure out how to play?
4960	0	a	Basic rundown of APB mechanics:  Miners (known as 'Criminals' in-game) run out and 'mine' stores for ore, or 'mine' civilian NPCs for ore. Then they load their load of loot into a car - which they pick up GTA style usually - to drive it to the shopkeeper to sell each individual peice.  Police (known as 'Enforcers' in-game) run around attacking miners whenever they manage to lay eyes on a miner when they do any of the above. Police can start a battle against miners and kill them to take all of their loot.   The miner faction is unable to attack police unless police start attacking first. This setup lends the power 100% to police. Police typically [always] just don't start the battle if they don't see a win from it. This usually tends to mean the police will have a severe advantage over the miners if they attack; a group of three or more against a single miner, outrageous weapons comparitibly, or outlevel the miner immensely. Almost always by the time the miner knows they're under attack they're already half dead (or less than a second form being run over) and haven't a chance to make up for the poor head start.   Ironically it feels like they gave the mechanics to the wrong factions. Enforcers are usually the antagonists and Criminals are usually the innocents in this game. It doesn't help that the situation causes most Enforcer players to get very cocky and the Criminal players to get very defensive.  The server is unstable. It crashes constantly; which sucks mostly because it takes about 15 minutes to load the game completely and it can last as little as 10 minutes before another crash.  The community is FULL of confirmed hackers on both sides. If you go into higher ranked areas you'll be tracked through walls and hit with aimbots. Lower level PvP is fun, but don't attempt to play to be the high rank. While there are no doubt some legitimately skilled players there are far more hackers. As far as I can tell hackers don't even get banned for hacking.   Final verdict:  The game is alot of fun. Sadly its mechanics imbalanced and it's full of hackers. The Enforcer faction is also highly antagonistic (albiet due to understandable environmental and psychological circumstances). I'd recommend anyone that still has any desire to play to avoid going Criminal faction. It sounds fun and cool when you hear about it but you can't do anything but be killed and robbed.
5688	0	a	Its good and if you like challenging opponents be my guest, but there is too many hackers.
3524	1	a	GTA with customization to boot.
4574	0	a	You have to rent weapons. WHAT!?  Need I say more? I won't. Not worth the $0 I payed.
10124	1	a	This game offers lots to do for mmo gamers at every level. The maps are large and look the part. Enemies vary to keep things interesting and generally fit in their environment on the map. Crafting is a HUGE part of this game and can be time consuming but it is done in a way that players can queue up tasks for offline time. Character can be built with skills chosen by the player and customized to fit playstyle. Quests are available in the game but are optional.  Personally the crafting element of the game is my favorite. It brings together the need to scavenge and find the parts you need to craft to advane further into the game.  If you enjoy a sandbox mmo that doesn't marshal you through it's world from start to finish and you enjoy the genre, I would recommend trying this game.  (This review is based off playtime from before the game was offered on Steam, I just recently switched to the Steam version)
1793	1	a	A mix between CS, GTA and Barbie (what other game lets you design your own clothes, including hand-made decals?).  Good stuff, though it's completely unfriendly to casuals.
7754	0	a	Doesn't even launch, no point in getting. So many people have had this issue, waste of almost 5 total GB
5465	0	a	I don't know why I am reviewing this to be honest I didn't play 26 hours of this game. It kept coming up and when I closed it then it came up again. So this game is alright, I guess you could call it a cheap rip off of GTA. This game really isn't to my interest I do not recommend this game. I would rate it a 4/10
1148	1	a	It has something the recent Saints Row have, but infact this game is alot better.   Gets out car, car goes kamikaze and kills me, would kamikaze again. 10/10

2010	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing flawless. Okay well maybe the only flaw is that i wish the map was bigger and there was alot more new content. But you will enjoy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ for a while then come back to it over time. Too bad they're too lazy and understaffed to make new real content. User content can only go so far, although there is plenty of that in this game that anybody can create, even you.

9759	0	a	Pros:  tons of content you can walk through horses you can walk through cars Cons: The engine sucks The gameplay is dull repetitive Kill by standing still and shooting or standing still and melee (movement in fights usually dosnt matter since it's out in the open and they lock on) IT JUST SUCKS!!!!
8106	0	a	Not great in my personal opinion. Hard to drive and when I went on I couldn't find anyone else. It's free, but there isn't any other reason than that why I would play this. And consequently, I dont.

3419	1	a	This game. Still one of my top 5 fave games, even after playing it for a long time. Skills and reaction time is all you need to win in this game (and maybe internet with good connection). No matter if ur playing against people with premium weapons or not, the stock assault rifle is enough to handle anything. Maybe except for OSMAWs and OPGLs. Customization is also the most thorough one i have ever found in games, MMO or non-MMO. check out my screenshots and see for yourself what level of customization level im talking about. enough of me talking, Play The Game. May seem a bit complex at the beginning, but once you got the hang of it, its really simple and fun. WARNING. HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.
2299	1	a	The worlds truly most addictive game.

3386	1	a	It's pretty good as long as you don't play it too much
7445	0	a	WAAAAY back in the day I was picked to alpha test this game. The entire community of testers told the Devs time and again that they needed to add things to APB other than pure PvP for the game to work. Unfortunately, they never listened to their potential customers, the game did terribly, and the original devs ended up closing shop because of it! Now that it's been out for a while on the F2P market I figured I would give it a try, to see if the game has matured into something other than what it used to be. Sadly, nothing has been changed. The same glitches are in the game, and even with a &lt;60 ping latency the server still bugs out when there's a lot of people in one place.   If all you're interested in is running and gunning against other players then have at it, otherwise I would recommend other games like The Secret World that are on the F2P market.
9050	1	a	good game look like Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 but More fun....... The difference between fallout and fallen earth..... her you can play withe other player do your mission and you can rid a car are a horse for your mission Instead of walking in fallout to your mission   how love fallout i recommended to play this game it will be a good challenge    
8685	0	a	I CANT PLAY THE GAME I HAVE A 64 BIT AND IT DOESN'T ALLOW 64 BIT TO PLAY THE GAME AND WHEN I LAUNCH THE GAME IT SAYS MY VIDEO CARD IS INVALID
9951	0	a	Very freaking bad video card wise and ill tell you how it completely crashed my PC that's how!!!
9990	1	a	This is one of those mission type/salvaging MMO's. I really enjoy this one. If you donât have this game, get it. Though if you have a normal computer, I would recommend you change the game graphic settings to their absolute lowest. If you do that, should be fine, otherwise you will rage quit from lagging to the point where you die from it. Because it is a 100% online game (no single player mode), most of the high end graphics is not needed.  Over all I really like this game. The lay out is great, I can play for hours at a time, and there are hundreds of achievements to try and unlock.  (8.9 out of 10)
4177	0	a	it's cool
5051	0	a	Started playing since the Reloaded beta. 2008 graphics/game, but you still need a mid-high end pc to run this without it FREEZING, barely new content has been added in +4 years, clothes, cars and re skinned guns, some cry about p2w but i think it is pure skill because (re skinned guns). 'Developers' (they cannot change game's code) are now trying to do tons of events giving players a lot of stuff for them to unlock certain clothes, etc, that's not enough, the game is dying, population is so damn low. The engine upgrade was meant to be released in Q1 2014, but they have only given some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pictures of the SOCIAL DISTRICT with more foliage and better lighting, not even gameplay. I don't even know how are they thinking of releasing a console version lol. They have to release the engine upgrade or just cancel this 5yr old beta.
4869	0	a	Poorly optimised piece of sh*t being taken care of by a company that only cares about your money.
10609	1	a	the best ever of all time of free shooters 10/5 if you ae reading this and dont have the game stop and start downloading it right now I dont care what other guys say they are haters that are jealous .!Play it
2570	1	a	If im being completely honest here, it's one of the most exciting games ive ever played. Yes At low levels and if you dont purchase items for the sellers it's quite hard to win missions but even the basic details like driving and looting bring a smile to my face
8549	0	a	60 mins of play time with my friend.   10 mins of trying to figger out how the char maker works 5 mins making the char  roughly 10 mins to try and figger the tutoral out.  nothing said how to get money. or that money was sitting in the mail it just said check mail not (your â¥â¥â¥â¥ is in the mail) than moved on to the next thing  finaly figger this out and get my stuff good to go after about the 25 min mark  me and my team mate get going. 2 mins out. we get killed by one dude we go out again. this time find nothing and no one to do anything. 10 mins later we are swarmed spend the 20 mins dieing and dieing and dieing thanks to spawn campers who in fairness may not have known they were spawn camping.   2 cops agesnt 15 criminals  when no other cops in the area were helping  why am i a cop?  
117	1	a	Another fun PVP action game, their is plenty to do, if you can find it. Also, finding competent team mates is sometimes a problem. The community can be rather toxic, though never as bad as LOL or DOTA. 10/10 Wish this version of cops and robbers existed when I was a kid and had more free time.
5907	0	a	I absolutley..............hate this game. In order to get a weapon that is actually good and you can keep it forever you have to spend real money to get this thing called 'G1C' or 'Gamer 1 Cash.' In order to get the gun I want i have to spend $50. And yes thats really not that much but I could buy a completely different better game exactly like this. Lower your prices and Ill play more often.
4532	0	a	The character customization was absolutely beyond anything I have ever seen in a game and the graphics are decent. Yes. that's pretty much the only good I see in this game. I can trick out my character and car for hours on end, making it stand out from the rest; but what good is that if the game is unplayable 80% of the time? You're probably asking yourself, 'What does that mean?' Well this         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded in a nutshell&nbsp;
2757	1	a	A game that is worth playing
4649	0	a	I have played this game for 287 hours and honestly was one of the worst experiences i have had in gaming. From the ridiulous leveling system, to the quite frankly pay to win aspect of the entire game, i would honestly NEVER recommend this game to anyone.  The community can be extremely toxic and vulgar, with casual swearing and slurs in chat, just a small anoyance, but nevertheless.  The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.  The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the 'you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents' attitude.  Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.  EDIT: Grammar stuffs
690	1	a	I was minding my own business walking across the street. I looked both ways before doing so. As I was half way through crossing the street I was struck and killed by a cop. I mean sure I killed 10 people but I didn't deserve to be killed.
8515	0	a	When this game was first released in stores and offered all content available to it's users, I heard nothing but great things about the game. Only downside was a smaller playerbase since many people simply have backed away from monthly payments for MMOs in the modern age of F2P (Free 2 Pay) games.  So eventually the game went F2P and moved onto Steam where I myself started playing it. Now it had a few bumpy issues such as having %30-%50 of the customization content blocked behind paywalls. But this was to be expected of a F2P game anyways.  Then the game slowly started changing...getting...corrupted...everything started costing money...the fun started to disappear as content was getting added slower...and slower...until the game was no longer the fun and customizable world that it promised to it's players. Now it is but a shell of itself, whispering...'pay me...paaaaay...meeee' in your ear at every opportunity.  10/10 wouldn't play again...
5723	0	a	As much as I like the idea, and feel that if it was a bit better made that it could be something wonderful, it's just not that good. If it wasn't P2W and was polished up, the game could be SO MUCH BETTER. If somebody actually made this better, it would be one of the best games IMO, but I just don't see it ATM.
7414	0	a	I used to love this game when I didn't have many games to play, but after going back to it I have noticed how glitchy and also how extremely pay 2 win this game is. Also, it'd be wrong to call this game 'GTA online' but it has a lot of potential and I did enjoy this game a lot playing till midnight with mates on Skype.   But to sum it up, the game simply has reached a dead end, the playerbase is basically dead and the gliches and P2W aspects are just stupid.
1706	1	a	It was fun
3331	1	a	really awesome
2947	1	a	This game can be repetitive on long gameplay but you have at least 10-20 hours of pure fun. GTA style, this game combine a good coop/pvp system with free roaming. There is also a lot of costumization about dress, cars and other stuff. FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1684	1	a	Epic! i recommend it
2635	1	a	Deffinately recommended since it became free to play. Its fun and entertaining. If you dont pick it up full time it will atleast make you giggle for a weekend if not a week.
1766	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME! I love to take my rage out on random people.
3853	0	a	it was fun but turned to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around a year ago and is showing no signs of improvements.  pros: - character and car editors are still unrivaled  cons: - greatly imbalanced gameplay - bad mission and level design - the worst community i've ever seen - huge performance issues - tons of hackers  may 21st 2015 UPDATE: game still bad
4346	0	a	One of the worst games i have ever played, do not play this,
2601	1	a	10/10 This game is the best when played with friends 
10455	0	a	well mixed views on this game, it's ambitous,but is still buggy, i enjoyed this game to start with, the wide crafting options often leave you daunted. but it's the crafting which makes this game great, mobs don't drop gear, they drop crafting mats...in fact crafting mats are everywhere,so if you want to roam the wasteland with an uber gun at low levels..then go play fallout3/new vegas, cos it aint gonna happen...unless you buy from the cash shop or have a rich friend in game, you wont get any real decent automatic weapons till lvl 10-15.....'lvl 10-15 you say?' yea...it'll take a while to get to lvl 10..and then you need to craft it...not as easy at it sounds,but there is always the auction house for your overpriced guns and gear. oh and pvp is so bloody broken on this game it's not even worth going into, lack of endgame/expansion content means once you are lvl 40+ this game gets old and boring real fast, not that you'll ever reach lvl 40+ , you'll get bored and decide to play new vegas by lvl 20.
9293	0	a	Honestly this game took such a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of time to download, I couldn't stand to even play it anymore.  Just playing the intro, there's a lot of controls to memorize and figure out just too switch weapons and equip something.  I wouldn't take this review too personally since I didn't play it as much, but just a warning getting the game.
6604	0	a	APB was totally perfect when the original developers and publishers released it. However they wen't bankrupt because not enough people payed the Â£40 subscription requred to play in 2010. After that gamersfirst bought it off the original company and it's known as APB Reloaded now with it still having all the features which it originally had and even a little more new features I do not recommend it because it is heavily P2W. You still can play it however you won't get the good guns, perks, vehicles and unlimited customisation if you don't pay. It's a great game but it's not worth playing unless you're ready to pay for things. Review is based on personal expericence and opinion. I've played since launch, rebirth on gamersfirst and steam.
3879	0	a	So, I wrote a review about this game a while back. But seeing how I didn't play much of it, I thought i'd give it another chance. So I went over to a friends house who had a better built PC, and played it there. After all this time... Still sucks. It's just another Pay-To-Win grind-fest. You either shell out 30 bucks for a gun that probably isn't very good, or you play for weeks and weeks only to be able to buy some freaking shoes, or some other low-end customization thing. The player creation screen is still confusing as all hell. The guns are generic and firefights are just the same everytime. Controls are clanky and slow. Cars handle like theyre on ice. And now, there are hackers on basically every server. So... Have fun with that. The Devs seem to be completely out of touch with their 'Fanbase' because these have been problems for about a full 2 years. There are also never any sales or community events. that 99.99 DLC went on sale ONCE for 69.99, woa~~~~~h. Just don't waste time. Go play TF2 or Blacklight, something that's worth the effort
5662	0	a	makes you use internet xplorer when making an account
8561	0	a	Seriously, dont play this game. If you don't get kicked after five mins, for some stupid reason, there isn't even a storyline in this game. And there is no one playing anyways. Dont waste your time on this..
1713	1	a	Fun game, if GTA and SR3 had babys, this would be the baby.
2713	1	a	Really good F2P gta alternative!
10481	1	a	(read it all) im uninstalling the game because i dont like nintendo 64 grahpics but its good aiming system nice wide area a wellthought out game and i played a chick without pants that whole time LOL tan lines OP

6059	0	a	I accidentally modded my gta v and this game poped up in my library, I don't know what happened but the graphics now looks garbage, controls feels like if my character is having a hangover, now hearing 10 years olds screaming in my ears and insisting that he screwed my mom last night. DO NOT MOD gta v! I repeat.
7064	0	a	Not the best game mainly because I can't join a server! The game doesn't even let me exit it whilst it's trying to join a server! (alt + tab doesn't even work)
9108	0	a	it SUCKS it took my like 3 hoursto play and it isnt even good
1303	1	a	APB A mix of GTA and saints row now the question is this game good  Good thing  -Customization is good  -weapons and upgrades are ballanced -classic cop vs robbers thing  -decent characters npc -grapichs are simple and good  Bad thing -you ony keep your new weapon for 7 days -The 'fair' fight system -new players -p2p to get better weapons or upgrade if you wanna rank up -minor bugs  overall 7/10 decent game to play give you the creative freedom to customize your character,car,logo and etc its very hard if your new to the system its a clone of gta and saints row which is fair the creator should really put there best effeorts in this game  BUT NO ONE CARES SO WHY ARE YOU READING THIS?!?!?!  idk thanks for reading and good luck playing p.s 80% of everyone that plays a character custonization is most likely female
3417	1	a	cool game austin should get it

2474	1	a	Difficult to get into, even as a vetern to shooters. Lots of customisation and tons of gameplay potential, ruined by the focus on payments and korean level grinding.  It's mainly an mmo and the limited player TDM is squashed by that fact.

4992	0	a	Basic rundown of APB mechanics:  Miners (known as 'Criminals' in-game) run out and 'mine' stores for ore, or 'mine' civilian NPCs for ore. Then they load their load of loot into a car - which they pick up GTA style usually - to drive it to the shopkeeper to sell each individual peice.  Police (known as 'Enforcers' in-game) run around attacking miners whenever they manage to lay eyes on a miner when they do any of the above. Police can start a battle against miners and kill them to take all of their loot.   The miner faction is unable to attack police unless police start attacking first. This setup lends the power 100% to police. Police typically [always] just don't start the battle if they don't see a win from it. This usually tends to mean the police will have a severe advantage over the miners if they attack; a group of three or more against a single miner, outrageous weapons comparitibly, or outlevel the miner immensely. Almost always by the time the miner knows they're under attack they're already half dead (or less than a second form being run over) and haven't a chance to make up for the poor head start.   Ironically it feels like they gave the mechanics to the wrong factions. Enforcers are usually the antagonists and Criminals are usually the innocents in this game. It doesn't help that the situation causes most Enforcer players to get very cocky and the Criminal players to get very defensive.  The server is unstable. It crashes constantly; which sucks mostly because it takes about 15 minutes to load the game completely and it can last as little as 10 minutes before another crash.  The community is FULL of confirmed hackers on both sides. If you go into higher ranked areas you'll be tracked through walls and hit with aimbots. Lower level PvP is fun, but don't attempt to play to be the high rank. While there are no doubt some legitimately skilled players there are far more hackers. As far as I can tell hackers don't even get banned for hacking.   Final verdict:  The game is alot of fun. Sadly its mechanics imbalanced and it's full of hackers. The Enforcer faction is also highly antagonistic (albiet due to understandable environmental and psychological circumstances). I'd recommend anyone that still has any desire to play to avoid going Criminal faction. It sounds fun and cool when you hear about it but you can't do anything but be killed and robbed.
7976	0	a	there needs to be more added to the streets because they look so empty and i dont think it would be too hard to add stuff as to fill the streets. i think that they should bring out a update to do with the graphics needing to be re-done.. come on its comeing to 2016 there are alote of games that have better graphics and that are free as well.
6150	0	a	this game looks good but its porly optimized so play it at you're won risk
9872	1	a	Awesome game. Too many quests though at one time. Wish my computer wouldnt lag with it.
9237	1	a	cool as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
4039	0	a	I spent ages playing this game on several different characters. It was fun, but after the security updates these people created, everything went wrong. You try to message the 'support' and nobody replies for ~15 days. I got banned for doing absolutely nothing, and when I tried to get my account back, I was told my account was found using 'malicious files'. Nobody had access to my account, I was getting banned for either being too good at times in the game (where people would report me for hacking when I wasn't) and the staff couldn't take a second to check my account and my files to see if I was actually doing anything. This community is filled with greedy people trying to get money from people and once they notice that certain people stop purchasing their G1 cash for a pay-to-win game, they stop caring about them. But hey, maybe you like this game. It became boring and repetitive anyway. Take it from someone who spent ~200 hours on the game on this account, it's not worth it. I've spent at least $150 on the game (and was gifted another $200, because my friends saw how I enjoyed this game), and in the end even after all the game time everything began to go downhill. The community, the staff, and the increased pay-to-win. Good luck if you still play, and try not to get banned for doing absolutely nothing wrong.   Edit 8/4/16:  I figured I would come back and see if anything was changed, and I wasn't as 'rusty' as I thought I would be. So I went and played around a bit for literally ~9 hours and got banned this morning. I contacted support requesting a refund for even the cheapest skateboard back accessory cause I am not dealing with anymore of this games bs.

6533	0	a	I have decided to not to recommend this game to any of my freinds. The reason lies within the game itself. The terrible community(people constantly calling you names if you win or lose). Terrible matchmaking. At the start of the game you will face people like you, noobish etc, but a few more matchmaking games and boom! You are faced with enemies with Pay2win guns, better skill and level, hackers, or just dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trolls. You will feel overwhelmed with either anger wanting to throw your computer out the door, laptop on the floor. Wanting to kill the enemy team. Or sadness that you downloaded this game. This game does show some promise but it is lost. The lag was so bad I had to turn of my computer or stop playing. If you want to save yourself the money and space on your computer you will not download this game. AND I WILL TELL YOU NOW DO NOT, AND I MEAN DO NOT BUY ANY GUNS.

943	1	a	APB reload is a fun open world cop vs robbers game and yeah there is a few bugs here and there but over all a greatgame and yes you need a somwhat good computer to run but its woth it so go have fun
201	1	a	APB is the one game ive played that ive had as much fun winning in, its rewarding, satisfying on so many levels. But its also one of the most frustrating and cheater filled games you'll find. But since they added the new anti-cheat system called 'Fairfight' its been a severe change amongst the opposition you face. Most of the time its good fun and great players, but at many points during missions you will encounter people that are questionable at best. Its widely known that cheaters still exist within APB Reloaded and it doesnt feel like the developers are actually taking it as seriously as some would want.  The game itself is based highly on the Ingame Marketplace that you spend real life cash in to procure lifetime bonuses such as weaponry, vehicles, clothing and the infamous 'Joker boxes' that personaly i bought over a 100 of, and never got any good loot from. Supposedly the boxes have a chance to drop legendary weapons such as the even more infamous 'OCA Nano' machine pistol. Its the most overpowered weapon in the game as its capable of literally wiping the floor with enemy opposition up too 100 meters(The maximum sight range ingame) even at full auto(LoL)   But even with the problems that exist in the game its still one of the few games ive spent over 1000 hours playing and still play from time to time. Like previously stated, you arnt likely to find a game that is as satisfying to win in as in APB.  If the gameplay doesnt do everything for you there is the most advanced character customization existing so far in any kind of MMO's out there, and you can spend hour after hour just modifying, adding tattoos, painting cars, and not actually doing anything else.  8/10

1663	1	a	pros basicly gta online  cons  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ optimization  -Alien ware alpha i3
3952	0	a	As a start,sure it is an interesting game.After a few days it gets repetitive.From missions to customizations and so on. The game itself has a great base.Criminals against the Police,a great idea.Were the game starts to break down it is in it's execution,and the outside.In the trailers you can see that it's possible to make artwork with the creation tools.Well,yes you can,but you will soon see that it's limited,only an amount of geometric shapes you can use,same to the cars,clothes etc. One of the things that killed me is that everything was limited.I put a lot of money in this because I had hope. The matches are stupidly done.I couldn't play because it wasn't fair.They put 2 dudes with rank over 20,against 2 with over 10. The only thing that counts as 'fair' is how many people vs how many people.I couldn't level up,only if I was very good at it,and I wasn't.It's the same thing,even if you are a cop or a criminal.Criminal:Go and rob something,steal a car,go to a point,capture a point,protect a point or just transport an object without the cops seeing you.Cop:Go and stop the criminals from doing all that. There is no easy way of making money since the matches are soooo unfair.Only one way and it's only for criminal(sorry cops). It's basically destroying with your car shops windows.It's a boring way,but it's worth it.The shops will drop a few objects that you have to pick up and put in a car.Then go to an AI and give the stuff,after that go to another place to get the money for it.This way I made about 20-30k a day,but again it was getting boring. I found that one thing was funny,was playing with your friends,it has a massive multiplayer.So I was actually having fun,even if I was dead or alive. The game itself has a hidden wall in front of it.It doesn't let you pass that much,most of the cool things are either for premium or they are hard to get,and only if you are good.I am not saying that you cannot get good items without paying or premium,if you are good,you can get cool items.But it's really hard to get good.When I say good I mean 'super good'. The game also has clans,I had one but it was pretty dumb and lame.You can make a icon for the clan and spray it on special spots in the city.And it is true that you can actually make songs.I found myself creating a lot of music,so that will be fun. This game has a short amount of 'gamemodes'.There are two cities,they are basically the whole game.Then there's these 2 place from both cities,where there is like a 'free for all' gamemode,and the famous 'Hanging Plaza'.Where you create,buy,and sell. In a nutshell this game needs a lot of improvement.It is fun,but you will find it anoying after a while.So it does not worth your time.You can try playing it a few hours,but that's all.You will get bored.I must say that the game is full of glitches and bugs so watch out for that,some are funny,but some aren't.Even after many laughs it will started sucking your soul and just turn into a pain in the leg.Don't bother with putting any money in it.Play for a while and if you aren't 'super good' at it,just delete the game,it will get repetitive and you will get nervous because you can't killed anybody(because all over 20).If you aren't good at beating people that have over your rank,just leave it. In the end this game is something that should'va been developed by someone else.Someone who actually knows how to make a multiplayer game.If you haven't played the game,just try it and the play something else.I played it too much,I was frustrated that I wasn't killing anybody.Warning!YOU WILL NEED A GOOD COMPUTER! If you are reading my review,just don't touch it.It doesn't worth your time,go and play GTA or Saints Row instead of this thing. So this game gets the rating of 3/10,an epic fail.The idea is good,they screwed it up.Now it's just a stupid,frustrating game that gets a lot of bad reviews.After a spoiler that it will be gta 5,and a few changes of title,all developted by someone who doesn't know how to make games like this.This is what you get,you get 'A.P.B.:Reloaded'. And if you say 'Changes of title?'.Yes,the game was once called 'All Points Bulletin''(A.P.B.).There was no 'Reloaded'.Go google and get more indepth informations about the past game.I don't know that much about it. SO GO AND BUY OTHER GAMES,EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS FREE,GO AND PLAY GTA:SA INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP!
368	1	a	Hmmm. It's a Solid game. However... there a couple of things that disturb me. For instance, high level players on a certain level get access to what we would call a Rocket Launcher. And this gives them godly powers. If you have to battle against a high level like that you're doomed. Its so overpowered. Some weapons are overpowered aswell, it's not like really balanced.   However, im glad this game is not Pay2Win, you can pay for extra options like cars and stuff but its really like a short cut. If you play long enough you will get access to that gear aswell sooner or later.   Finally i want to mention how wonderful the customization is though. I wish more games had such awesome custonization. Because, you can customize all your clothes, guns, cars, tag and much, much more!  UPDATE [24-05-2013] APB is the Most Hateful community i know on the internet. You can't go around, playing, for 1 hour without getting called extremely bad names, cussing, rage or false accusations.   On top of that its full of cheaters with aimbots and wallhacks. Reloaded Productions however doesn't make ANY effort to punish these people. And the updates they are bringing lately are Sad, repetitive and overpriced. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you APB!
7159	0	a	So APB has had a rocky road. Real Time Worlds was the first company to develop and make APB. However, the game was plagued with issues. From talk of supposed ex employes, the game was rushed out for lack of funds. Some employees cam out and posted concept art and plans for what they wanted to do with the game but couldn't because lack of funds. It sounds amazing.  So you had this game come out and it was horrible. The optimization was in a horrid state. Griefing and hackers everywhere. Horrible progression system. Some horrible missions. General horrible map design. To top it off...it cost 15$ a month to play.  Needless to say, it failed. It went under. RTW went out of business (hence the in memorium at the start of the game). The game I think lasted like 2 months? G1st bought them up later in 2010.   Sadly...they've done nothing with it. Lets go over the major changes they've made to the game.  1. New Anti-hack system - this helped with the hackers, but there will always be hackers in the game. Its in a much better state, but as a f2p game...you know how it goes.   2. Fightclub - Essentially they took parts of the pre existing map, put up barriers around it, put it into its own instance, then threw 12v12 battles into it over certain objectives. Not really adding anything. Mainly just...re-arranging stuff.   3. Joker Tickets - a special currency from fight club. I will say that they did add in quite a few items to be used with joker tickets.  4. Cash Shop Introduction  5. Numerous cash shop guns  6. Numerous cash shop clothing  7. Numerous cash shop cars/kits  8. Festival events that often have a heavy cash shop undertone   9. New 'end game' NPC that sells new clothing/gear  10. New equipment/consumables  11. Performance fixes/bug fixes/optimization  12. Removal of 'bad' missions and poor designed missions  13. A 'better' matchmaking system  So over the past 6 years, those are the major things that have been accomplished. As you can see, they didn't really add anything into the game. The major things that can be considered additions are the cash shop related stuff, one NPC that is at the very end, better anti hacker, and their gear, and joker tickets gear. Fightclub wasn't really an addition since they're basically just copy and pasting pre-existing code and blocking off a section of a map that is already there. The asylum is a special fight club only map, but even that is rumored to not be made by g1st. Apparently it already existed in the game files but wasn't quite ready for released. I think it took them like 3-4 years to released it.   Now there are problems that existed in the game with RTW...that still exist.   1. Matchmaking. It's horrible. See there are two things in the game. You have a threat level and a rank level. Now I think the max rank is 255. Rank is required to use some gear and generally tells you how long a player has been playing. Imagine this being like levels in a standard MMORPG. Higher ranks have access to more gear, equipment, upgrades, cars, etc. Threat level tells you how 'good' you are. You go from trainie, green, bronze, silver, gold. It's insanely easy to get gold if you're even moderately good. So how does the MM work? It only takes into account threat level. So I've been in situations where you have a rank 50-110 with low level gear going up against a highly geared 255 rank in gold districts. Heck, even silver districts have this issue. It doesn't end there.  Now this game has districts. Districts are split by threat level. Gold can join gold and silver districts. Silver can join (I think) gold, silver, and bronze. Bronze can join silver, bronze, and green. A gold can't join a bronze district for example. What people do is intentionally lose games to lower their threat level to join lower districts. I just had a fight where you me and one other silver and a traine going up against two rank 150+ gold players in a bronze district.    http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/391733-matchmaking-at-its-best/   That's a good indicator at how bad the MM is at its current state. Even with their attempts to fix it.   2. Horrible Map Design. They never really tried to fix some of the map issues. In terms of a shooter, it's still bad. Full of choke points, campable areas, and just general frustration. There are freeways in the game and they're what they sound like...big open freeways. People love to get snipers and sit on them because they're insanely hard to take out since you have to find a ramp and hope you can make it to the sniper before he shoots you as you drive across a big open area.   3. Edge of p2w. Right now the game is basically 'pay money for good gear now'. Most of the guns/weapons you can get in game. Personally I consider 'pay real money now or spend 30+ hours working towards the same gun' to be p2w.   4. Progression is slow. You need to progress roles and contacts to get certain gear. Some gear like upgrades require you to use a weapon to unlock upgrades for it. So if you want to get a certain upgrade for your assault rifle, you've got to use your assault rifle a ton. So if you're in a gold district there's a chance you'll be fighting highly customized weapons with a unmodded weapon. It's very frustrating.  5. Horrible Mission Design. So the only thing they touched with the mission system is taking out missions. Sadly, they can't take them out (that would mean they have to make more). There are still horrible ones. Two off the top of my head. One is called VIP. A player on one team is selected to be VIP and everyone in the game can see the big VIP marker from anywhere on the map. Through walls, etc. Basically taking out any sort of stealth strategy for one team. The VIP has a set amount of lives and the attacking team has a set amount of lives. Putting the entire games success on the hands of one individual that may or may not be horrible (and is handicapped with a 'wallhack' so to speak) is very frustating. I hate being the VIP. It's not fun. Another one is where each team gets a big marker above the head of each member and a set amount of lives for the team. Basically a TDM. Again, no stealth. The amount of times I've seen people standing behind walls looking at one another with third person view waiting for the other to move is a ton. Or they all go to some insanely easy campable area only counterable with a nade launcher (which is like an endgame, last unlocked weapon). Or worse, they get enough kills to be considered 'winning' and then they run around the map running the clock.   6. Optimzation issues. Still huge FPS drops randomly. I think it has something to do with the gun smoke. I can run Gw2, GTA V, planetside 2, elite dangerous, etc etc. However, I still get horrible FPS drops in this game. Apparently they're making a new renderer which I hope will help the game. It's very frustrating to get into a firefight and have your FPS Drop to like 2-5 randomly in the middle of it.   7. Spawning. Spawning in both Fightclub and the vanilla mode is horrible. For example on the VIP thing. The amount of times I've been spawned in road right in the sights of an enemy sniper is a lot. Or wayyy far away from any team members and closer to enemies. Today I was playing fightclub capturing a point and TWO enemies spawned next to the point and killed me. So lame.   The major reason that this game is pulling the numbers it does (peaks at around 2300 right now) is because there's no other game like it. GTA V did put a dent in the population. APB averaged around 2100 players the same month as GTA V release and some months before that. After it released it has been dropping till what it is now...averaging 1400 player. If they actually did something with this game in the 6 years they've owned it, I'd recommend it. Right now it seems like they're putting forth minimal effot to keep it alive and makin money. Maybe they've spent all this time prepping it for console release
8937	0	a	Controls are bad, graphics are bad (even on maximum), gameplay is bad, story is bad, so much more to name. Don't get this game. 5.7 GB wasted from monthly bandwidth.
1463	1	a	I've played this game so many hours (mostly before i have been released on steam). I have spent so many hours in the social district to create and design my own clothes and cars. To sell them for a good amount of ingame money.  But also the multiplayer experience is fun.  It brings some issues with it but i think it is still enjoyable.  Pros:  -open world -fully customizable cars and clothes -quick missions with a lot of action -aimbased shooter -a quiet nice community  Contras: -a lot of hackers -sometimes laggy -update dates takes too long
1701	1	a	One of the best games i have played in a long time, 9/10!
5161	0	a	This game in its current state is complete and utter trash, along with its dwindling community. I'm not even going to THINK about touching this game ever again until they release the updated engine, if they ever even decide to release it. This game was a blast to play in its hay day, but it went downhill quick. Give me my APB back, I really do miss it. Unfortunately I'm going to have to give this game a bad review until they update it.
5730	0	a	ok ever since i started playing and realtime worlds went bankrupt and you guys took over there has been constant server problems the same dam issue has been going on for months and you guys dont seem to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥. this would be a good game if you people would just fix these dam issues. obviously the servers this game is on now cant handle the â¥â¥â¥â¥ so maybe you should switch the â¥â¥â¥â¥ over or something. tired of paying for for this game i feel like im just wasting it making money of of us yet you guys dont want to take the time to fix these problems. so as of now my rate is pretty dam bad if you tell me. you guys dont deserve a good review at all.
4397	0	a	This games all good but the problem is its a big game and u need a good graphic, some bugs and hacker on this game.
9433	0	a	Body Hair? What're you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gay?
9613	1	a	its an awesome free survival game were you can craft stuff,fight zombies , and do missions but the only problem is the tutorial sucks so if there is an option to skip it that would be great :)  
4915	0	a	Cops 'n' Robbers... sounds great doesn't it. The concept that hearkens back to boyish childhood games. Yay!  But this... *sigh* I can't recommend, even if it is free.  Gameplay:   Yes, there is a wonderful range of customization to your player and vehicles, but dress up dolls does not make for a fun game.  The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.
2561	1	a	the best game but kicking me all time plz fix it
6325	0	a	its a really bad take on gta filled with asians
5464	0	a	Change the name to APB: Hackloaded and you're all set.  Expect to loose a lot. Expect to get bsed out of kills. Expect to get aim botted. Expect to never win a mission. Expect a toxic community prob worse than COD players.  Expect to Uninstall this hack infested game. Give you computer a condem before you let it experiance this infested monstrosity.
7969	0	a	The game michanics could be tweeked and the graphics could be better but it seems like a big pay to win.
5957	0	a	Worst game, Crashes alot 0/10
8253	0	a	I've played this when they first came out, even before on steam. THE GAME I LOVED IT!!!! COULD not stop playing both of the sides for 2weeks!! Then hackers started poppin out of building and walls. I waited to see if they will be gone  or atelast most of em but NOPE!!!!! gets worse n worse.. so i said F*K this n never played this EVER again.
1512	1	a	Its funny to do this game with ur friends , so dont play this alone.
8944	0	a	Lens flare, dubstep, overly choppy graphics, cheap knock offs, ingame purchase, super zombie apocalypse 5, with new and improved mechanics and gravy over everything crap.   Pass  
367	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is 'cheating', most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.  I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.  Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.  See you in San Paro!
113	1	a	Best game I have played in a long time!
10697	1	a	Great game! Too bad the devs have decided not to support it. I fugure if I buy the game, the people who made it owe me a little consideration for the purchase.
1936	1	a	cool 
4426	0	a	How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons.   This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.  The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.  This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...  The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!
6941	0	a	Would you stick your tongue as deep as you could possibly reach inside the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a woman who has been used as the city's sperm dumpster? If you answered 'Yes', then by all means, play this game.
9319	0	a	Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.
8141	0	a	Do not get this game, unfair, pay to win and no fun to play at all :/
9301	1	a	Thumnbs up for this game,It is very diffrent from the other games I have played before but is loads of fun!!!!
9366	0	a	full of crap.
439	1	a	the game is great but when i open it , it closes it self.
5714	0	a	I should start off by saying this game is 2laggy4me which puts me off in the first place but oh hohohho do not worry I have far more to talk about.  Now the only positive in this game is customization. You can truly make everything unique and it can be pretty fun to make your own car. But now lets start with everything â¥â¥â¥â¥ the matchmaking puts you in with people who hack, have rocket launchers and who have dial up connection the hackers are at a fault of punkbuster and the rest is the result of people who play too long and people from far away countries. I constantly get put into a team with people from Spain (nothing against Spain) but they don't spek English and more importantly I don't speak Spanish so I can't coordinate. Next are the missions there all the same and pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sandbox you ask? None oh sure there's a huge world but everytime I turn off matchmaking I just get put into a match anyway and even if i did roam most of the time they can't be killed unless you go into the pvp place (rocket launchers and â¥â¥â¥â¥ galore). There isn't much to do really it has alot of things but doesn't perfect â¥â¥â¥â¥. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥ING P2W â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND IT SHOULD DIE. Except the customization idk put it in a good sandbox game like GTA
3116	1	a	Good game not as good as a GTA but i still give it a thumbs up but the only problem is the 30 mins it takes to load it.
7665	0	a	The plot is â¥â¥â¥â¥, because there isnt really one, and the servers never â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORK!
4248	0	a	APB Reloaded is terrible, everything is either incomplete or broken. Just like the movie After Earth the amount of advertising made the hype too large for them to handle, they managed to get Tobuscus and Seananners to be in their Live Action trailer, but unlike After Earth, you canât watch it as a comedy, because even though M. Night. Shamadingdong movies are a joke within themselves, games have to be experienced, people have to do things to experience and in a movie you just watch it, in games you have to experience it for yourself.   Letâs start with the glaring issue. Either my crappy computer wonât run APB while recording to do a video review or that this game refuses to let me record on it, bear in mind I play games like Banished and DC Universe Online while recording on this computer so I dunno, but Iâm leaning to APB. Also it has this fun habit of pulling my computer to a screeching halt to only throw me back into the action 5 seconds later 100 game metres ahead of my last non-lag location. Again this is not my computer, DC Universe functions just fine on this laptop, a game bigger and better than this game, so why does this game make me believe every time I try to drive a car, my computer is going to spontaneously combust?   Letâs talk about the driving, now this game is interesting. Most games run the driving controls through the same server, registering at the same time as you would be running right? NOPE! In fact the Driving mechanic is simulated on the servers, and the server controls where your vehicle is located, so when you try to turn the server has to calculate where you will be when you turn, and then it sends back the coordinates and the direction you will be facing. There's normally about a half second of delay but the instant response you get in EVERY OTHER GAME WITH CARS IN THEM EVER, Is really off putting, Youâre not holding the key down to turn because who knows how long the turn will last, you end up tapping it really fast to be more accurate, that is not a good thing, because you have to calculate the speed youâre travelling the catch the turn or youâll hit the wall.  The game back bone is lacking, the cars are broken beyond belief, what about the guns and the character customization. The APB Reloaded character creation screen is the best thing this game has to offer, itâs in depth and you can really show your individuality. This is implemented well, with your Personal Vehicles and Clothing, however you have to go to another server to do all these customization, in hindsight that was a wise thing to do, didnât want players to be constantly spawn killing you while youâre customizing a symbol you put on your shirt or car. Itâs smart but still frustrating when the loading screens are horrific. It only loads to a map where you choose to spawn which then takes you into another shorter loading screen. If you just look at the gameplay trailer announcing APB is going free to play, the graphic have drasicly changed from the video to the game.   This isnât a new thing, for example Dark Souls 2 and Watch_Dogs but this isnât the same game, worse graphics by only a bit, there is a massive UI overhaul, it was like someone downloaded a mod to the game server and decided to mess the UI up as if it was a rage quitter at a board game and smash the crap out of it, itâs a mess. Itâs not user friendly at all. Now when I was younger and stupider, I posted videos on YouTube of me playing this game, and I will admit it has changed, they have added two more areas, basically the same two areas, Financial and Waterfront, but its PVP, so hopefully, more of these battles can happen, but I somehow doubt it.  APB Reloaded is a game, which is torture to play, for some reason people love it, they are all really high level players, they say the game is different when you get past this level, well they said the same about destiny, Iâll never find out if either are true, because of the same reason, while youâre in the small levels, youâre constantly screaming at your screen as all the people which are good at the game kill you in one hit. Itâs a vicious cycle I donât enjoy, thatâs why I giving the symbolic rating of Grand Saintâs Crackdown type of game and numerical rating of 3/10. Also ever since I played this game my computer runs slower, I think this game is virus, I would be surprised from the legend known as EA, âitâs in the gameâ huh? Or is it in the amount of money you can funnel from us? I guess weâll never know.
8014	0	a	game will not even play, says apb failed to initialize physx??? game wont play at all. i have a gtx 980 i7 4790k and still wont play
9875	0	a	its so bad dont download 
2028	1	a	its awesome
9296	1	a	i can say the game is overall fun, it has a unique story that somehow after many years makes me pick up the controls again and continue where i left off. it works for all it's subtle game play and it is a fun time all around in my opinion. you have to work for what you want. sometimes it is very time consuming, but once you get your prize it is worth it
9646	0	a	I got it and it seemed it had a cool concept (post-apopolyptic mmo) but I got bored very quick after the first part of the game.
3721	1	a	Awsome game must play and be a criminal of course :D
374	1	a	Its very fast pace for a game like this but still is fun!
4481	0	a	This game is a perfect example of what should not be made.  Broken Weapons Awful As Hell PVP  And don't even get me started on the extreme amount of pay2win  If you want to do good in this game, your going to pay for it. Literally.
9769	0	a	Best game ever. Its like Sims character editor with less features, wont even load the world after you made your character and all...
8951	1	a	Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said 'screw you' to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE. 
7654	0	a	Pay to win. So simple.  Was getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ until I picked up a free (for 30 minutes) rifle from the marketplace and suddenly it's like the good switch got turned on.  Not interested.   Would be a cool game if they just went pay to look good but it's just another cashcow. Steer clear.
748	1	a	It's an ok game but it's free. Startup takes forever but besides that it's a good game.
10558	1	a	Best arena shooter I've ever played, and its free! The biggest problem with this game is the lack of people playing it anymore. At least give it a go.
5526	0	a	p2w not cool.
248	1	a	110 hours of dump truck driving.
3150	1	a	Me and my one friend were driving after this package in the enemy's car and there was a guy on to of the car who had a rocket launcher and blew us up.  69/10
7301	0	a	I downloaded this game hoping for it to be what I hoped GTA V online to be like (before the game came out). I was for sure, not let down when you were allowed to steal cars and use guns in this game. However, it being stricly online make sit impossible to learn unless everyone around you is also new to the game. In a game like GTA V you can practice in story mode then take your skills to the streets of Los Santos online. This game did not allow me to do that, leaving me terribly confused and irritated to say the least. Unless you're good with shooters like this, I do not recommend this game.
8919	1	a	This is a very good game. I love the crafting system, and being able to buy the gear you cant get off of an auction. The one thing I really dont like about this game is... it dosent feel like a survival game. Sure you can food, but all it does is give you some boosts. I would love to see a version with more survival aspects. I'll give this game.....8.5/10
2256	1	a	Time for a real review, I wrote a review several years ago when i was playing this game. APB Reloaded at the time i was playing it. In a watered down statement is fun, However the game has a New player 'hump' so to speak. That is to say that when you start actually playing the game and not the tutorial portion your going to hate the game. This is because this game is pay to win type game. The more money you pump into the game the easier it will be for you. While i played this game the most i ever did was pay for the premium account for little boosts and i bought a DLC. That didnt increase my performance in the game by much at all. My progress was strictly grinding and finding the weapon class that suited my play style. and figureing out how to counter the wallet warriors of the game. I was very good at the game. as a matter of fact i played so much i nearly finished the origional game contact mission providers which would mean i had unlocked all vanilla content. not the new stuff that the new devs that bought rights to have been adding since. Bottom line, if you dont have the patiance to grind throught this game to get to the point were you can enjoy it then i dont recommend. I will warn you thought you will likely be raging every session and find yourself comming back for more. Thats how i was. GG and Good luck.
3287	1	a	Its very fun and its worth the while
7281	0	a	This was one of ma first games on the computer and its brand new and it lagged a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton
9411	0	a	It sucks.
1998	1	a	GTA online FTW !!!
9987	0	a	This is the worst MMORPG I have ever played in my entire life. This game is so bad that when I played the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing floor and wall textures didn't load, ON THE TUTORIAL. This game laughs at players with TERRIBLE graphics, HORRIBLE AI, and render distance that makes Atari look like Half Life 2 in HD. The only thing good about this turd of a game is that you can uninstall it. I would rather chop off my testicles and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, than play this game again.  -100/10
5156	0	a	Horrible. Got banned for buying premium.  If you want to try it, get some premium codes and get a free week of premium, then try it. Otherwise - it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. I got so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing angry when they banned me just after buying premium. It feels like the moderators or administrators are 10 years old. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ it right up its money hungry â¥â¥â¥. It's like a blonde basic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - waste some money on her, then she leaves you. At least the sex was good.
3407	1	a	Let me start off with the word: 'wow...'  This game has stolen so much out of my time. But in the good way of course!  I have played APB: R for a COUNTLESS amount of hours. I met tons of nice people, that I eventually have become really good friends with outside the game.   The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play! (the game died after a subscription model, but got brought up again)
8963	1	a	So happy this is free-to-play now, had a lot of fun when it first released. Graphics are dated but if you can get past that its a pretty cool and unique MMO in a world of garbage clones.
10233	1	a	this is and outstanding game to play its like fallout and dayz mixed together you can get vehicals to drive horses to ride go on adventures kill monsters other people on the server get guns such as ak-47s but in the game they are diffrent names rifles shot guns pilstols and alot more
3759	0	a	Don't let my hours fool you, I also have several thousand on their standalone client. This game isn't worth your time unless you're already a veteran, and we veterans only play because of very flawed and irrational reasons.  Infested with cheaters of every flavor, community is a toxic cesspit with only a few good people, cash shop has stopped pretending altogether that it isn't pay to win, etc.  If I could take back all the years and thousands of dollars I've put into this game, I would do so in a heartbeat... even if that time and money wasn't returned to me.  Reloaded Games is unethical, unprofessional, and just plain greedy. They're still not worse than EA, but they definitely would give EA a run for its money.  Also, yes, this is partly a rant. However, that doesn't change the simple fact that it's truth.  So yes, go ahead and dismiss this review, and waste your time (and inevitably money) downloading this game... but don't say you weren't warned about what you would be subjected to.
2135	1	a	This game is like GTA but free and it's funny
361	1	a	Good game. Quite frustrating in the beginning but once you get the hang of it, quite fun.
5608	0	a	Whatever you're thinking of doing with your life...Searching through free games or any other kind of games...Install ANY but not this game...This game has officially been overrun by hackers, it was once a good game (2010-2013) but now it's dead to me deep inside...DONT INSTALL THIS GAME.
686	1	a	Its probably the best game i've ever played , but mainteance of the G1 is a serious issue and ruins it for everyone  However game is still playable and has about 1000-1500 players daily on Citadel (EU server)  I vote yes for game and no for G1
910	1	a	this is amazing game any one need to play
5865	0	a	This game honestly seems unplayable to me. I'm sure its a good game, but I can't see for myself because when I go to register theres a little sign/symbol thing in front of what I think is the next step button. I can't even get past the first step because of this. Theres no guides or oher people having this problem. I can't scroll, I can't move the box, just completely stuck. 0/10.
949	1	a	Fun game. Free to play but Buy to win.
8537	0	a	Game used to be great in the past....used to play it ALL the time. I mean ALL THE TIME! But things have changed.. Back in the day you had to have actual skill and had to grind to get the most op of weapons and whatnot...these days you've got lvl 9's ( starting rank ) using an Orange weapon and then dominating the whole match with it....Then there is the Nano..the most overpowered weapon in the game and the sad part is low ranks use this to get Gold threat..oh and did I mention the OCA Whisper? Then you have the Developers...they don't give a damn about the game other than adding more P2W â¥â¥â¥â¥ and then adding in 'Events' like kill these many people with a specific weapon and get â¥â¥â¥â¥....they add absolutely nothing new to the game ( like they used to back in 2013-2014 )... Just play it, buy an Orange weapon and BOOM! you're a pro with no skills...From me this is going to be a sad No due to the MAJOR P2W the game has got
9179	0	a	They game wouldn't even load for me. Before you say its my internet or my PC its not every other game I own works (except for L4d2), but when I did play it on a friends PC it sucked
9589	0	a	this game is s h i t
6737	0	a	jesus â¥â¥â¥â¥ing christ the startup is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
8159	0	a	This game sucks so bad omg , it looks fun but once u start playing it.. its so boring and lame
5052	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.
10038	1	a	Closest thing to Fallout Online there is. Unfortunately, not a whole lot of players. Definetely try this out though.
5656	0	a	Full of bugs and errors strait from the start
3384	1	a	If they remove all the hackers would make the game so much better, but if they did that it would be such a fun gmae
1670	1	a	This game is a hit or miss for some people. There are so many problems you will want to scream but the one thing that keeps me so hooked is how unique this game is. It's not like an MMO where I can just quit and pick up another with some minor differences and a setting chance. The gameplay is one of a kind and I wish someone would create a better game with the same concept and gameplay but this is all we have so I reccomend trying it out for yourself and decide yourself by playing the game instead of deciding by reading negative reviews.
1550	1	a	good gmae. long loading screens
5508	0	a	this game is bad im playing on a gaming pc what cost like 1200 dollars and im still lagging and I puted this game on the big disc how the fuq this game sucs
1129	1	a	i need an understanding of this game.. i just dont get it , but its addicting ,i have fun and frustraion while playing it for hours at a time..
7446	0	a	This game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. But unfortunately, GamersFirst, or as many like to call them, CashFirst, Moneyfirst, or Gamers' Wallets First, have pretty much destroyed what they game could be. The way the system works give anybody who is willing to borrow their mom's credit card and pay for Premium will have an advantage so massivly unfair that it makes me wonder why they bothered even making it F2P when the F2P users get so royally screwed.  Call me a cheapskate, but I am a person who will pay any initial fee, but I will NEVER pay extra fees if possible. At the time this was written, I was a college student who is, go figure, dirt poor. APB: Reloaded is so much fun to play, but unfortunately, when teamed against people who have payed for extra perks, you can expect to rip out more than half your hair by the end of the round.  The game offers MASSIVE amounts of customization through the wide variety of players you can generate, and the decals you can create to decorate your outfit, car, and more. Though Premium players get much more than Free players. This I can understand, as if somebody wants to pay extra for aesthetic purposes, good on them! However, what you can buy weapon wise tips the game excessively in your favor, making it pointless to really play it if you don't have the money to.
10419	1	a	World of Warcraft with a Fallout 3 texture pack.
10449	1	a	HEY is alright
10288	1	a	My friend found this game just scrolling through the Free to Play games one day and I am so glad he did. I probably would've never seen it if he wasn't just looking. This game is amazing! I love Fallout and this game has many themes that feel just like Fallout does, and it adds multiplayer to the game. Just got it last night and we played for 8 hours straight! amazing game!
10818	1	a	Awesome game. too bad it's now a desert...on Mars.  As for my gameplay time, I playd Tribes: Ascend long before it was available on Steam. I just loged in to see how it's doing and apparently it isn't doing anything.
8259	0	a	i like this game a lot but the thing i hate most is not being able to drive i joined a server that had a a 284 ms i cant drive shoot or do anything really so i cant play unless theres a server close to me.
9761	0	a	This game is one of the worst game i ever play
549	1	a	Seems to demand way more from your computer than it should (though I admittedly know little about MMO game design) and it LOVES to stutter at the worst possible times for me.   It also feels very 'pay to win' at times, though that's usually only a major factor if the opposing team is stacked with premium items. One on one, A skilled player with vanilla items usually still trumps an unskilled player with premium items  That said, if your computer can handle it smoothly, it can be a blast to play with a group of coordinated friends. Steam only let's me thumb up or thumb down, so I recommend it with an 'if' attached
7422	0	a	Doesnt even launch.Best piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ on steam.
6721	0	a	So hmm, this game is awsome, the features and combat system is amazing the only down about this game is that theres too many hackers. Idk if hacks are easy to get in apb but you can see one hacker in almost every missions u play
1494	1	a	8 Hours gameplay, 40 hours downloading. GG
418	1	a	All around decent game, fun to play either good or bad. Plenty of people play it. PLENTY of mods, weapons, downloadable content etc. 10/10 IMO  Only downside is people who Aimbot or hack. Other then that its a good game, and its free.
5848	0	a	  Pros- Customization You can earn money within time Fun like gta Free  Cons- Pay to win game Can only rent guns Glitchy Gamepasses cost to much Laggy Bad community  Overall No just No
9311	0	a	I can't login to the game! Tell me how to login it... :( 
2497	1	a	Certainly at its best when playing with a group of friends. Sure the game might try to reason with you to spend money on the game (Decals limits, exclusive items, powerful weapons, increased EXP rate) and have bad community where in my case, people swearing left and right and accusing of hacks. It has bugs but if you're with someone you call as a friend it's easy to let those errors slip aside. If you have someone playing the game, give it a try. If not, well you can try and make friends over there.
8468	0	a	Hello Guys, I've played this game for years starting in 2010 with some friends and I have played around 2000+ hrs on my account and 60 something hours via steam, But the reason I'm writing this review is to give advice to the next Innocent person walking into this â¥â¥â¥â¥ hole of game. Firstly the game is a love hate relationship you either like it or hate it not to mention also customization is brilliant but here comes the negative aspects.  Apb is a free to play mmo cops and robbers themed game, With free to plays you expect microtransactions well there is but the problem is they milk people for money, without considering what people actually want. For example people want the engine update or fix's for annoying bugs, but instead of good updates which make people more happy they slap a armas gun on the market place claiming it to be something magnificent, but it is only a reskin of another weapon in game.   Another reason why this game is bad is because of it's own community, the people in the community are absolutely cancerous and only strive to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off or make your day worse, Not saying everyone is cancerous because I've have spoke to quite a few nice people it's just the majority. Not to mention there are quite a few unbalanced weapons, like before I used to think 'Well that guy is Just better than me' Which in most cases it was; but if you put a unbalanced weapon in the hands of a good player or even a bad one they can â¥â¥â¥â¥ your entire match up.   After all of that Negative â¥â¥â¥â¥, I'll come down to saying this I'm giving a Warning to all players or people thinking of Playing this game. This game can cause you stress like nothing else and if you have anything like epilepsy or some sort PTSD stay away because it will cause you so much stress and make you soo â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you're either going to have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing seizure or just freak the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. Last thing I will say just to give you another reason to not play is gamersfirst make tons of promises which never happen.  Out of 1-10 It's a 4/10  Thus that makes the end of my Extremely Negative review and if any of you are interested I'm selling 4 of legendarys on Jericho (NA) add Ryoukomatoii and PM me or leave a message in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ review. Legendaries, Grenade launcher which shoots Concs, Nano, Ntec 7 Ursus and Hitchhiker I believe. I'll take real money these Will be going at a cheap price
5571	0	a	Cant play it sad face WINDOW 7 BALL â¥â¥â¥â¥
3153	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
5020	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
6791	0	a	Until this became 'pay to win' it was a very enjoyable game. I spent many hours with friends running down cons in our pimped out squad cars. I was happy to pay the minor monthly fee back then for that bit of near hackerless fun and no PTW store. I noticed a lot of 'features' cost $ that before the changeover didn't, a way to make an extra buck for the devs I guess.
1770	1	a	This game is fab. Better than all Grand Theft Autos!
8834	0	a	They have a good idea but poor design its a little laggy and it gives trouble when trying to open up i think if it gets more work done to it it could be great but as is gonna give it a 3/10
3149	1	a	Ya this is a kool experience in itself.
7755	0	a	It's like second life but with a campaign.
360	1	a	Dump trucks, just get one and drive them into things, it's like the main point of this game. JUST DO IT.
2809	1	a	Free-To-Play, is about the only reason to pick up this game. The community is small, and it's not as polished as it could have been. That being said, it does have it's fun aspects. Everything is a little confusing/overwhelming at first because you're kind of dropped into the world without much of a tutorial, but it's not difficult to work out. Having a friend who plays or would play with you religiously would make it a decent way to spend some time.   Overall I give it a 6/10, it just seems like a dying game that didn't live up to it's potential.
9140	1	a	I loved this game, it's just so addicting! The only problem I have withit is the ocasional lag. But besides that it's fun!
2603	1	a	Great idea, not great game. Loads of cool thing behind pay walls, some items are pay to win, severs can be lagy and a fair few hackers. Got a mate or two the game can be real fun, other wise it's pretty bad.
9540	0	a	Cannot connect to Server
7646	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
5369	0	a	JUST READ IT BEFORE YOU PLAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU FROM A MENTAL BREAKDOWN  F UCK.THIS.S HIT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALVUE YOUR SANITY.At first this game was awesome alright, having fun doing good stacking up the g's. Now my first thing i want to say is that there is A F UCKING R ETARDED GLITCH where when you buy a gun it will charge you for it 2-4 times losing the money you just spend 6 hourss working for. Next complain. ALOT OF THE PEOPLE, mostly the criminals, WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE F UCKING D IPSHIT A SSHOLES WHO FEEL THE NEED TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THER F UCKING MICRO P ENIS'. When your trying to earn chash,the point of the game, you'll have people who decive you, say they will help you and right before you are about to get money they will f ucking r ape you and give you their F UCKING AIDS so that you die and they can steal your money. Next, when your in a van your IMMEDEA TELY F UCKED; having a van basically says 'hey im transporting a s hit load of money come and f ucking get it you c unts'. Now that will trigger all the squeakers around you and they will immedeatly flock to your a sshole trying to wait for you to get out of your van to steal your it, the f ucked up thing is that you need to leave the van to stat making the money, not going to explain ho because it will take too long. Just image the scene from finding nemo with the seagulls, great now replace them with R ETARDED 7 YEAR OLDS. Ok, my final point is that one of the easiest ways to make money is ram raiding which is what i have been talking about mostly, when you have been sweating your a sshole off for the past century to the point where it's dicintegrating your gonna have a nice fat stack of chash available in the back of your van. When/If you get to turn this in with out the f uckboy's around stalking you. Your gonna be on the map if you have above 2.5k dollars. When you've been working THAT F UCKING LONG AND THAT F UCKING HARD AND YOU GET IMMEDEATLY F UCKED IN THE A SS AND YOUR MONEYS BEEN STOLEN YOUR SOUL GETS SUCKED OUT OF YOUR A SS AND YOU WASTE 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE ME WRITING A RAGE REVIEW ON STEAM BECAUSE ANGER IF THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. And so concludes my review/essay on why never the play this CANCER GAME.
7691	0	a	After some time playing APB, and spending some money on 30-day premium account, I would not recommend the game. The game is full of hackers, the matchmaking is awful. Gold-rated players vs Bronze-rated players. The server lags every 5 minutes. The 'comunity' is full of annoying and toxic people. For new players, the game is non-friendly.  If you plan to buy guns, vehicles or stuff like that, for 30-day or lifetime, prices are way too high. I find the developers so greedy.   However, the game has a lot of customization chances, and the open world, free roaming and missions are good. But they don't justify the game itself.
2138	1	a	I played this game befor it was on steam and I like it. The custimization is everything. no Joke if it is in the game you can custimize it. A game I suggest to play. But the game gets repetitive, and some weapons like the sniper rile ae over powered. And people like streaking so yah. p.s. JOKER AMMO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
2813	1	a	Very fun, you can creat a lot of stuff for your cars or your own outfits and it's a Shooter, what do i have to say more exciting than that? :D
2556	1	a	its so funnn
8566	0	a	well it could have been a great game but the missions are repetive and it just feels clumsy  also there is the pay to win part.. the grind is horrible on free player and customization even is limited if you dont pay  i dont really know what to say about this game... but it's horrible...
6056	0	a	it a pece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ it wont work i coudent even play is fix it for now my reveiw stands
3416	1	a	Best copV.sRobber game ever
9525	1	a	I liked this game alot it definately can submerge you in quests and loot farming, searching for parts.
1228	1	a	its pretty great, if just to mess around with the charecter custemization lol.
4828	0	a	Suckass game it is...
1146	1	a	I Love the game becuse it is like cops and robs 
4500	0	a	BUGS OUT LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I CANT PLAY IT
9209	1	a	its a nice game keep up the good work :)
7704	0	a	Not fun at all, many players in game are uber powered and all they do is look out for new players to kill over and over,dont recomend
2282	1	a	this game is a great conscept, and has a ton of potensual.though this game is not as great as it can be.the game has long load times and,though its probably just my computer,is laggy as crap(if crap could lagg).driving is terribal,i cant even sterr strait.the games missions are confusing,and i can never figure out what i was doing.  there are a lot of good things the game.customization is great,there are a lot things to do with the money you earn in missions, and there are many optians for combat,not just shooting at the bad guy.you can get in a car with someone else and shoot out the window,though the driver cant.you can get on top of most building in the game in some way,which is great for flanking.  the game has a lot of flaughs,but it still is good.i recommend the game mostly because its free.dont get the game for a slow computer like me,but if you can,get the game.  6/10
7622	0	a	This worst game what made with unreal engine...so many server lags...full of cheaters and bugs.How it's still alive?  Or why not made another game like this?
2064	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
6750	0	a	This game is one-sided and a pay to win. If you have good guns you win... not cool
2535	1	a	This game. Hell yeah. You can be the biggest pimp there ever was. Sell stolen computers, mug scurbs on the streets, put on that backwards hat, add a spoiler to that gay car you bought, you can do anything in this game, well, that a pimp would do.
6257	0	a	glitching
4133	0	a	the game fails to load at all no ater what i do and it goes he same with a mate of mine too
9672	1	a	For all you Fallout lovers out there!
4842	0	a	Hackers. Hackers everywhere.  If you like to f**k up other peoples playing experience then this game is for you! It was really enjoyable to begin with but everything changed when the hacking nation attacked. Selfish community too!
4884	0	a	This game requires another 200MB after isntalling with steam and if you verify your installation it gets caught in an endless loop of wanting to redowload the whole 6gigs. FAIL.
8174	0	a	Want to try an MMO that's Free to Play!? This game has some of the best customization out of any game I've ever played. You can customize your character's clothing, appearance, tattoos, and even your car. It's FREE, check it out today!!!  UPDATE (1/1/2016): If I were you, I wouldn't waste your time on APB: Reloaded since it has become a Pay to Win style game. The company that took this game over has changed it from the glory this game once was.   You'd be better off NOT wasting your time with this title.
9088	1	a	For a free to play game this is worth a look, it has a nice feel about it, and a good starting story, would suit the causal gamer and is quite easy to get ito, controls could use a tidy up, but over all for an 'Alpha' not a bad place to start, pleanty of missions and a good crafting system that is easy to use for noobs Great exprence if you havent played a mmo before, this one is quite forgiving unlike Dayz
6930	0	a	dont even bother, the devs are milking this game for every micro transaction its worth and then some.
6340	0	a	Reasons it is bad 1 Pay-to-win 2 Unblanced 3 Hackers that they do nothing about 4 Runs terrible 5 Looks terrible 6 Plays terrible
10159	1	a	Great MMO,but graphics are kinda crappy
3998	0	a	A pretty below average game in my honest opinion. It not only uses an old Unreal Engine, but has many limits, in terms of draw distance, fake bloom effects and jagged shadows.  Even while having a powerful rig, this game will still run poorly, which may also explain the decreasing numbers of people playing the game. I know people who have played this years ago and are no longer able to handle the game due to terrible performance.  Theres a poor choice of missions in this game such as: Defuse bomb, Ramming, Stealing which is basically all a click 'f' to wait while this circle fills up to 100% and offers no challenge whatsoever.  However, props to RTW for creating a game with such amazing customization, like i've never seen before, and may be the only reason why i play this.
9737	0	a	About as fun as masturbating with sandpaper.
763	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
4644	0	a	This game is miserable.   The gameplay itself is decent, playing as a poor man's GTA Online (years before GTA had online). The customization is second to none. The amount of options you have for clothing, tattoos, decals, car paintjobs, and spray tags are limited only by your imagination (and subscriber level). If this was simply a graphic design sim, it would be the best around.  Unfortunately, it is an online shooter. It is in this aspect that the game fails horribly. The matchmaking is either insane or non-existant. The game ranks your skill in four levels: green, bronze, silver, and gold. You will come out of the tutorial as a bronze or silver, and be immediatly pitted against gold players that are maxed on rank. You will look at your own team and see another bronze, two silver, and an enemy team of five gold players. Now, the fact that they are max rank does not confer any actual bonuses on them (aside from weapon mods to slot into their weapons), but it does show a blatant lack of balancing.  This game is also infested with lag. All those customization options from earlier? It takes awhile for all of those to load in when the action gets hot and heavy. Expect frequent pop-up while driving, and cars that will seemingly continue to drive themselves after you hit the brakes. Ending the game does not end the lag either. About 25-50% of the time you exit the game, it will continue to run the process in the background. Meaning to fully close the game, you will have to ctrl+alt+del and kill the process manually. This game lags so badly, it can even lag you out when you are not in-game anymore.  The weapon purchasing system is a bit of a pain as well. You start with a generic assault rifle and pistol, and need to lease any other guns you wish to use. This gun will be available for the next nine days, after which point you will need to re-lease it again. If you do not feel like grinding through the ranks, you can spend cash in the shop to lease unlocked guns, as well as some guns that have mods that are not available with game currency. This leads to pay2win guns that are simply better than the guns you can unlock through playtime with game cash. It is important to note that even the real cash guns are not bought, they are returned at the end of the lease and must be purchased again with more real life money.  The community is a mixed bag. You have ultra-creative people selling outfits, tattoos, cars, and paint jobs that look like professional designers made them. Then you have the usual toxic shooter crowd in the other districts. There will be lots of griefing, whispers of hackusations, and you will be sworn at in practically every language on Earth. It is very easy to fill your ignore list up in two weeks of play, leading to needing to delete past offenders off the list. Since the game is rated-M, there are no limits to what you can say or display on the boards. Expect to see â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, swastikas, and other unpleasant things sprayed on walls throughout the city. This game is truely a troll's paradise.  Pros: - character customization - vehicle customization - creative community  Cons: - matchmaking - performance - business model - toxic community
5098	0	a	This game is free to PAY  the microtransactions are VERY expensive, and worth less because the things you buy AREN'T PERMANENT, they stuff you buy with REAL MONEY are there for like a week. then you have to pay more. and if you are smart and don't pay money this game is slow and impossible to enjoy this game DONT'T PUT MONEY OR YOUR TIME IN THIS CASH GRAB
7827	0	a	I was exicted when I first heard about this game coming out, back before they cancelled it. I'm not sure who picked up the ball and finally released it as 'reloaded'... but I gotta say I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't a diehard fan of Grand Theft Auto. Or if the diehard fan of GTA were to be insulted by this game really, but if your looking for online interaction with your fellow GTA fans, just play GTA online with their latest release.
5214	0	a	YEAH, NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME...i didnt even get a chance to play it, it instantly crashes, and now theres a godamn pop up from the devs stuck on my screen after i unistalled it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU. â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU
2151	1	a	this game is like a low budget gta but its free to play and its rly fun.
499	1	a	Steam is showing that i'm playing the game but actually i haven't played it for a week. Ty for the free hours.  Also customization is great 10/10
8935	1	a	I'm new to this game that's why I can't tell you much about this yet. This game, as the others says, is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG. I love this game even though there are small number of players. Yes, there are still players playing this game that's why it is not yet 'DEAD'. If you have a problem in-game, just ask in the chatbox and many will respond to you. They will help you a lot. There are also many quests (main or side quests). It is not that easy to level up but it is fun killing and tracking monsters. You can craft, ride horses/vehicles and so on. As of now, that's the only thing I can say. I recommend this game. I'm not telling you to expect that it is a good game, but for me it is awesome. It's still best if you review it yourself. Have a nice day!
8733	0	a	Doesnt even launch.Best piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ on steam.
7085	0	a	Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play a game funded entirely by players who buy one-shot-kill weapons with real money?  Look no further.
5635	0	a	WHY WAS THIS MADE   i cant even make a character, the story is horrible and gameplay is way too glitchy
9358	0	a	Every time I tried to leave the tutorial level, the game would crash.
10661	1	a	I recomend this game to whoever is interesded in a fast past first person shooter. The controls are very user friendly and are made very close to your left hand. For example: To throw a grenade, you press 'F'. To slash sombody, you press 'E'. And to skii, you press 'Space'.  This has become one of my favorite games and it could possibly become yours too. Download Tribes: Ascend NOW    -shadowmation6621  
4879	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.
2457	1	a	APB (All Points Bulletin), the first online game developed by David Jones, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is a massively multiplayer online game based in living, breathing cities that will feel familiar to players, as they precisely replicate famous cities all over the world. APB is a turf war involving two main factions, the Squads, whose goal is to uphold the law, and the Gangs, who seek to break the law at all costs. Players will be able to choose their side, in a classic good guy versus bad guy scenario.
888	1	a	Really cool game, a lot of customization! While it's pay to win, you can dominate every player, just depends on how good you are in the game! And really, It's free. You have nothing to lose! :)
9662	1	a	I think this game has alot going for it and I defiently recomend to other people 6/10
2684	1	a	cool game
2781	1	a	Really good game overall.
9719	0	a	Laggy pice of â¥â¥â¥â¥, had this game before worked great, now no updates....laggy as hell cant even aim or move without laaaaaaaaagggg
9006	1	a	You can collect 'Suspicious Cheese' and 'Questionable Meat'. The epic journey of surviving in a post apocalyptic wasteland by crafting horses.
7163	0	a	worst game ive played 2016 so hard p2w do not even attempt to dl this
4017	0	a	APB Reloaded is the same game as APB: All Points Bulletin, so if you did play it then and liked it then you will like it now. Behind all the good customization locked behind premium membership you find the bad combat that made it emerge as a F2P tittle in the first place. What made players leave in the first place is still there, what made players stay is still there tough whatever that was I cant see. This game should have stayed dead and burred, it was supposed to be GTA online because thats what we wanted and its not. Worth a try for the customisation alone, not worth staying for the combat for any amount of time.
398	1	a	this is one fun game it is like gta but an mmo or you could say it is like saints row with more people i love this game and it is free to play so go check it out 
6636	0	a	Doesn't want to load
4697	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
2541	1	a	LOTS of fun if u find out how it all works and find a good team of ppl willing to play with u
279	1	a	I like this game For its Customisation ! and how you Are able To Roam in this game
863	1	a	Pros :   - Its Free!  - Character Customization is pretty good.  - Decent fighting  Cons :  - Its Pay2Win but anybody with common sense will do 'Fine'  - A little buggy.  - The driving Mechanics is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible.  - Kind of un-optimized.  Well that about sums it up about this game its pretty decent and its not what i expected. 7.5/10
4480	0	a	Bad GTA 0/10 Just Buy GTA YoU CHEAP â¥â¥â¥â¥S
9331	1	a	Love the game reminds me of a old fallout game classic!
1134	1	a	I definatly 100% recommend this game as its a fun free roam car and shooter game. It's soo good ive scored over 500HRS on it!
7682	0	a	SO uhm, yeah. High level players versus people who literally just joined the game. so fair 
7741	0	a	Awful, pay2win It's called reloaded, but it isn't much different from the buggy beta
4162	0	a	Even if I would recomend the game to anyone, I still think you shouldn't play it because of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ company behind it.  I played APB since the realtime worlds time. I love it and played it like crazy. I bought several ingame purcases and spent several hundreds of dollars. And then, boom. I got banned. For no reason at all.  They say I have ben using third party tools. I say I havn't. I mean, I speak in skype with my friends when I play, but that's the only program I can think of.  I tried to tell them that I hadn't cheated, they kept telling me that I had. It didn't matter that I had played hundreds of hours and spent hundreds of dollars. In their eyes I was just a lousy cheater that didn't even deserve a second chance. Even though I had done nothing wrong.  That was about a year ago. I still havn't gotten my account back. I have spoken with both gamersfirst and evenbalance (punkbuster) but I keep getting the same response.  Play if you want, but don't buy anything. Because if do get banned, even if you havn't done anything wrong, you will never ever get your account or the money and time spent on it back.
4549	0	a	I can safely say, that this is one of the games that fall into the horrible 'pay to win' category. The player that pays for advanced weapons and equipment put you at a disadvantage. However, it is still possible to kill them if you know what you're doing and you work well with your team mates. If you're a casual fps player, I'd look at another game, unless you're able to learn from getting killed over and over by pay to win players. If you have some skill at fps games, this should be no problem.  Putting the whole 'pay to win' discussion aside, this is just a mediocre game at best. Everything is rather reptitive. If you're a criminal, you steal items for money or fight enforcers. If you're an enforcer you can catch criminals in the act and/or fight them. It's rather boring. The map is horribly small; you'll have seen and explored everything on your first play through. Therefore, you're losing out on the whole 'discovery' aspect of many successful games.  This games works in two parts. There is the explorable mode and the mission mode. While not on any missions you are unable to fight anyone. While you're in a mission, you can't kill anyone else but your targets. There are two issues with this: 1) If you come online and want to join your friend in a mission, you can't. You are unable to help kill their opposition. 2) If you're in a mission, a person outside the mission can thwart you by ramming your car, blocking your path, and being the eyes of the enemy team. You are unable to kill them. They are a ghost.  If you're going to play game as a solo player, just don't. You'll be so bored, so fast. You'll become frustrated easily from losing over and over. Players in this game are rather bad, so expect your team mates to play horribly. However, if you're going to play with friends, this game will give you some entertainment value.  This game gets a 2/10 for being some what fun if you play with friends. Regardless, this game is not worth picking up.  
4889	0	a	This game is a giant Microtransaction. It revolves around your purchases and is the essence of P2W. This game had such potential, but they devs turned it into a disgusting sack of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I will never touch again. I Can't complete any missions without some naked â¥â¥â¥â¥ running around with a Golden LMG and RPG between her cleavage while I'm stuck with an Anti-Material rifle that shoots Butter and Chick Peas. The community is toxic, too. I've only met 1 nice person, and he was P2W, too. I understand why you need to add Microtransactions, but, for the love of all that is holy and untainted, don't make the Premium â¥â¥â¥â¥ TOO OP. Learn from Valve. They made TF2, which you can play for nothing. You can best everyone without paying a single penny. It's not constantly shoving 'Deals' and 'Special Offers' into your â¥â¥â¥ all the time. The vehicle mechanics are Pretty decent, though, (Kudos :3) but it feels like the tires are coated with Cillit Bang Bleach, Translucent Vasaline and Lemon Lube mixed with spit. I played this back in 2013, and Only recently got back to it. Still hasn't changed. (Neither does war. :3) I have nothing else to procrastinate about, because I wanna go watch some Animemes, so i'll tell you a story of what happened in APB Reloaded to me.  I Load into the Financial District, excited to see what had changed, When I pressed K By accident and got shot into a Mission faster than the Speed of Light. I was put into a Vehicle Drop-off mission with someone with the Default 'CPA In Training' Shirt and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ trousers, and a Battle-hardened P2W Girl who was, pretty much, butt naked with an RPG and Golden .44 Squished between her crack and cleavage. I was stuck with the normal STAR 556 at the time, so â¥â¥â¥â¥ my life.  We got into our Cars, the Newbie's being the first car you get, and the P2W Girl's being something that popped out of a Tron Movie that had morphed with the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard. I had something that resembled a Dark-grey Golf GTI, and we set off. Little did we know that they were lying in wait.  As soon as I turned the corner to get the Vehicles, I was bombarded my Bullets and Cooked grenades. I felt like I was in a Video made by FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I Love his channel :3). I pressed onwards, but my car was shredded up within 5 seconds because of someone with, what looked like, a Portable .50 Caliber Heavy Machine Gun firing from a roof opposite to me. I made a run for it, and managed to get behind cover, but someone was there. Waiting. They busted a cap into my buttcheeks with some Futuristic Asiimov Rifle from Battlefield 4's New DLC, 'The Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ future'. The P2W Girl on our side had gone behind the enemy, and had blown her into space, creating the ABP Space Program as she did so. I was feeling the adrenaline. I jumped into my car and sped to get the pick up, when... all of a sudden...  I got Teamkilled by the P2W Girl. And we lost. I then proceeded to drink Brake Fluid for a Panzershrehkt Tank Destroyer, which destroyed my Organs. And i Died.  Fortunately, I got better.  I'm basically saying that this game is a waste of time and money.
2018	1	a	Awsome Game, But My Computer Get Blue Screen So That â¥â¥â¥â¥ Me Off!
208	1	a	i consider this game better than gta
1533	1	a	the only game where you can dress up as a teenage mutant ninja turtle driving in a jurassic park car game of the year 2076
3508	1	a	High character customization. All player vs player.
6504	0	a	Pay to impress kind of game. I would not buy if you not willing to pay alot of money. Good gameplay just very limited if you havent paid for extra content that should be free.
2098	1	a	My game is broken but i have played it before and its realy good. 
5212	0	a	This Game I Dont Like, Cant Even Run it.
9796	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
10314	1	a	Best survival Free2play game on steam
1542	1	a	10/10 hit a guy with a baseball bat
8707	0	a	This game sucks, it is nothing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trailers, all you do is go into a mission which has several objectives in it. everyone kills everyone no matter the team. I can't believe I wasted 1.7 hours of my life on this. I'am deleting it off my computer until they fix this laggy â¥â¥â¥ piece of trash game.
2572	1	a	this game is awesone
9409	0	a	fallout meets mmo.  thats about it.  +1 Post-Apoc -1 clumsy control -3 time consuming crafting. and i do mean time consuming. its like EvE on ground. it takes x time to make y item +1 zones are freaking huge -1 other players.... think barrens chat -3 the bugs. oh lordie the bugs. nothing like taking a shot at something and magically what would be a killshot turns into a miss because it moved to the otherside of the screen  so 2/10  i tried to love it
5023	0	a	I Cant pull up the launcher it is SO BROKEN
10254	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
3525	1	a	I still like this game has alot of going for it but its already been out soooo long and they could have fixed so much stuff by now but they just dont.... They really just need to listen to the MAJORITY of the players not the 200 random douches that cheat on this game or just pay to win
1476	1	a	 I'd like to start this review by saying that this review is coming from a late 2011 to early 2012 veteran.   This is by far the game i have most played hours in and they're still going up. Overall i belive that this is a great game despite all the negative reviews and issues with it. Now i could sit here and list all the flaws with the game, but where's the fun in that? If you're able to look over some of the problems and get a few friends together to play this game, you'll probably not regret it.     Now to some common misconceptions...    This game is  not  pay to win.  Alot of people tend to think that because there are so many items you can buy through armas  (their real life money store) . But truth be told, most are just reskins of weapons that you can buy in-game by just playing the game. I'd say that the N-Tec  (their version of the AK)  is one of / if not the best weapon in the game. Which you can ofcoarse buy for in-game money or reskins on armas.   There are not as many hackers in this game as people belive.  There will ALWAYS be hackers in a free to play game. But alot of people think that every other player is hacking. I belive that this is not the case. I can't even remember the last time i faced a player i was sure cheated in some way. Most of the time it's that they have far better teamwork than you. They might be sitting in teamspeak giving out information to their teammates and so on. This is after all a team game. Like in CS:GO you're bound to do better in a team then you are on you own with randoms.     Here's a couple of tips for new players...    Do  NOT  join silver districts nor open conflict. When selecting a dristrict go into the advanced tab in the top-left corner and join a bronze district. All good players are in silver districts because of the way they have  â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up  made that system.   This game is extreamly CPU heavy. I for example have a 6700k. I get stable 100 FPS  (which is the cap with a 60hz monitor) . I used to have an AMD 8350. With the AMD i barley got 70 FPS and very commonly dropped to 40 FPS. You'll also need more than 4 gig RAM despite it saying that in the recommended. But you'll have to try out for yourself.     I did not cover the flaws in this review because if i do you'll just go and look for them. Enjoy the game as much as you can. This is despite all a very fun game, hence the positive review.    IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR WANT TO YELL AT ME FOR GIVING A POSITIVE REVIEW PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS REVIEW AND I'LL ANSWER.
6925	0	a	still not better than gta I  this game is crap / this game is crap
5645	0	a	really bad game put high level ppl in your match way too many crims and biased torwards premium stuff dont get it. this game should be removed
9918	1	a	Some of my best gaming memories comes from this game
3158	1	a	Awesome Game But The Update Doseint Make Me Play The Game :(
3191	1	a	This game has a good idea about it but they need to sort out the level difference in lobbys 
6828	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
8343	0	a	i can play the game but it keeps crashing and i dont know why
1053	1	a	I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to feel like they should be winning but still be losing anyway.
7088	0	a	Game is dying and horrible. Got 7 different max ranks over 5 years, over 10,000 hours. Game is just dead.
8225	0	a	The game was okay, at first. Open(ish) world, tons of customization, lots of options for starter guns.  Then i played for a while. Missions are dominated by players with money, and the games skill rating matchmaking doesn't factor in Pay to Win guns that are leaps and bounds above what you can buy with in-game currency.  If you have money to blow, i say give it a shot. If you plan on being a free player, i say stay away.
1136	1	a	Yes its a great game. If u dont have enought $ for gta 5 get this. Nt the same game that much but very similar!
5847	0	a	Have you always wanted to play in bland, dead worlds? Have you always wanted to play a lame GTA ripoff? Do you want to waste space on your computer hard drive?  If all of those answers are no, don't get this. GTA is worth the money.
4401	0	a	The game is now based purely on micro transactions. At the end of the day, If you pay you win.
1217	1	a	This game is awesome and the customization is awesome but prices in armas is real expensive its like 50 euro for 1 car and its super laggy you gut to have a real buff computer and awesome internet connection to handle this game without lags. i recomend this game if you are planing to play much because when you are beginner you dont get really much of the game and you will only met pros in misssions. 9/10
8973	1	a	Spawns in, like 'Wtf is goin' on', gets on car bomb atv and blows up a wall or some crap, spawns in random place with Russians running around asking 'Hey you fat american pig, this is Dota right??'.  - 11/10 Would play again
2679	1	a	how do i staert it 
6592	0	a	Balance issues. Griefers. And just a bunch of trolls. Its fun to do the customizations and the costumes, but ever since APB was released, it never felt right to me...
1783	1	a	This game is a real challenge if you play alone, there is alot of players that are really good. Few months ago there was a raid to kick out all the hackers when they get reported and that made the game playable again. Irocammand tha game if you have few friends to play with you in a 3 or 4 player squad if you start. There is NO limits in customization of your clothes to your cars, so your oponnents will reconnize you if your start to be a threat :P. I hope this was helpful, good game!
4629	0	a	I tough i would give this game a chance again with my friend but afther i read someone s review and realized what ADMINS are like in this game i probably will just play it cuz of my friend other than that its â¥â¥â¥â¥ game even back when i played it couple of months ago.
9915	0	a	could only play for 5 sec before the game crashed and when ever i log back again the same thing happen... oh and appearnly i cant access the options of the game anymore for no reason -.-
8768	0	a	This game si â¥â¥â¥â¥ too shooting.
9511	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is so boringg i willl rather cut my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the graphics are bland your character is so slow and right from the start the game overwhelms you
10535	1	a	You should play this game just to experience what is it like: going 400 mph with flag while being chased by half of enemy team.  + Greatest and most unique shooter you ever play; Deep mechanics, it have its own tips and tricks; Great and balanced classes; Awesome and smart developed maps (except one, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Blueshit); Still breathing servers  - Devs have abandoned game, so no support and updates; High cost of weapons and gear (but now they reduced prices all around like -75%); Game filled with veterans, so expect having â¥â¥â¥ problems  Try it, you will lose nothing. You may play regular like me and fill those empty servers, maybe this will attract attention of devs and they'll revive this great game.
10757	1	a	The game is addicting, and reminds me of Halo and Doom alot. Its as great as TF2 
6581	0	a	It's hard to not ragequit.
309	1	a	A great game with endless customization.
7649	0	a	This game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people 50 times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. This game is not for new players or people who HATE grinding.   -50/10
9953	1	a	this game is amazing it is really fun to play with friends or solo.The map is big so you wont get bored of your suroundings and there are always missions to do .The combat engine is realy good and it runs smoothly(even a laptop can run it)i would highly recommend this awesome game:D
510	1	a	I was bored and my brother told me to play this game and I was shock and it was fun and i'm new anyway so I think I will have alot fun on this ABP Reloaded. +1 for you owner/coowner/staff member thank you for making this game
2415	1	a	I ran someone over and they flew up into the air. 20/10
684	1	a	it's cool game and i like it because it's many things to do
6806	0	a	Didnt care for this game. nice pick sides but environment overall wasnt great
10433	1	a	pretty badass if you ask me 
8902	1	a	Updated : 8/18/15  Currently the game has undergone large changes to the combat system (Skills and Mutations mainly) which gives far more choices for character builds. Previously there were skills, and mutations, that were not worth taking for any given reason. This isn't the case anymore.  Missions beyond Sector 1 are terrible unless unlocking vanity items or social boosting items, you're better off spending your time killing NPCs that give the best XP for the least effort (rats for example) because the Devs are most likely never going to fix this issue.  The 'story' within the missions is still good, but you will feel cheated after completing a 5 hour long quest that you could have earned 30x the experience along with 20x the profit/reward.  Weapon choices for PVP will feel very 'one sided' in 1v1. I recommend not going 'Rifle' if you plan to fight 1v1 in PVP. In Group fights is where it shines, I strongly recommend avoiding Assault or Battle Rifles at level 55.  Lack of updates since the previous major update (8/1/2014) beyond increasing 'Dome Tokens' have lead to a heavy decline in population. DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO HAVE REGULAR UPDATES, the Devs are depressing when it comes to this. Not to mention never finishing projects completely... they simply move on to the next 'big' project.  Examples : Terminal Woods, Alpha, TC, and Dome, None of these are 'finished', just 'acceptable'.  If you plan to get to end-game, ignore ALL previous weapons/armor at 55. As there is no progression into the newer armors, it is best to save all your chips/DT for the AP weapons and GT Armor since they are the same price or lower than the previous armors.  DO NOT EXPECT TO NOT DIE TO SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR FACTION IN PVP : It is intended through lore and mechanically for your own faction to beable to kill you in PVP, this is indeed a wasteland and should be treated as such.  THERE IS NO GROUP CONTENT WORTH DOING IN THIS GAME : It is nice to bring a friend, but don't expect to find some amazing place for your 8-32+ group that's challenging... let alone rewarding :(  I only play now to help others learn the game, kill rerollers (those who remake after previous bans), and PVP if there is any.   While the game is old, it is limited by F2P standards I would recommend it for a game to play if you enjoy MMOs, crafting, and of course PVP. Only downside, don't expect to master 1 skill, it's better to be great all across the board on skills to give yourself the best advantage in PVP at least.
1795	1	a	This is a great game to play. It is an urban 3rd person shooter game that is an MMO Co-Op version Grand Theft Auto. It has a MMO RPG like system built into the game with progression, levels trading, ect. Tons of customizations to cars, clothing, weapons and charactors. The only issues with the game though are the expensive items and upgrades. Maintaining a lease on the weapons gets very expensive for pure free to play players. I highly reccommend that serious players go pay to play and get a perma weapon and side arm they always use. Also, the general community is poor and very trollish. If you can ignore the bad sides and stick to a good team of friends, it will be a fun game for you to play.
10200	1	a	This game looks great and it's gameplay is good too!
9543	1	a	IT WAS AWESOME ALMOST AS AWESOME AS THE 4 DAY DOWNLOAD!!!
1839	1	a	Really fun game, you can play with friends and customize your clothing/Cars.
7464	0	a	May just be me, but I feel there is a high Pay2Win issue with this game. Nice idea, but I feel like everyone can plow you over.
301	1	a	fun game and it's free plus people just to let ya'll know it's preety much a pay to play cause most of the weapons u have to buy with real money and if u don't most would be like 10 or 90 days that u can have it soo yea theres that just play it
9381	0	a	This game have serious performace issues... I crash everytime I try to play, I cant move more than 5 steps and it crash.
402	1	a	This is an awesome game. It's one of those games where you can always come back to, and feel welcome back when you do. I have over 500 well spent hours in the game, either raging, creating, whooping â¥â¥â¥, or just chilling with my online mates talking about the government or something stupid. There is a huge amount of freedom in the game. You start off with a car, gun, pistol, and one character mod. The start car also comes with a spawning becon, where you can spawn into a moving getaway car! Awesome right? It is a pay to win game though. Now with my amount of hours, you're probably thinking, I'm one of those payers? Well no, i wasnt all i baught was a car. But with practise, i started whooping â¥â¥â¥ big time, pay to win players where raging at me. There was only one character I was afraid of, but unfortunately i cannot remember her name. All i know, is if you want to practise your aiming ablity, dont go sniper first, go N-tec. Definately a gun where you can whoop â¥â¥â¥ with or without mods. You do need some processing power, pc and mind wise. Teamwork is key to beat anyone. Anyone with a good team, can beat a pay to win team.  A good strategy, and keep your eyes on the map. Avoid sprinting in close corners, you dont always have to right click aim, you can shoot from the hip, dont reload around enemys, switch to primary. Remember to always try flanking the oposing team. Shoot in small bursts, aka dont hold the trigger, constantly click it. It does help! I reccomend not having auto ready on, as some people need to get ammunition, different cars, see someone etc before a new mission. You dont have to mission for money, you can ramraid, or catch raiders.  If you need to know more, just ask me and dont uninstall EVER! Because i guarentee satifaction with the game. Its not easy to start off, but once your driving skills has increased. Reduction of lag, and you've gotten decent aim, or decent teamwork you will be loving it!  Always make sure you join a clan/guild on the game. The wurst thing about this game is playing alone. Always try to go with people who you know are like in missions so you always know the best thing to do in the mission for the win.   It's not about the kills, It's about winning, aka stealing kills, is fine! sounds like a dicky thing, but the better gamers are like more help the better!  I can't play the game anymore as i got my own pc now, and untill i get a motherboard that isnt made of stone, i wont be playing it, but untill then ill just be dreaming about coming back to this AWESOME GAME!!!!
1444	1	a	Awesome game in my opinion, the character creation is great and it is really fun. The only downside is the hackers and lag. All in all a good game I would recommend if your into the Third Person Shooter kinda stuff.
2514	1	a	Its pretty fun, be wary of it being a bit pay2win.
6270	0	a	Cheaters everywhere.
579	1	a	11/10 would play but wouldn't cuz edgy to hate it all.
5130	0	a	It's a p2w. If someone has spent some money in this game, and he is in the enemy team,you are so dead. I don't like how when I started to play,Proffesional players was killing me nonstop in missions. I spent total of 910+ hours.        FFS Make this game play to win not pay 2 win. .I.
4157	0	a	What used to be an amazing game with great fun and laughter for friends and clan members has now become 'Hackers Paradise'. Gone are the days when G1 cared primarily for the customer, and now only care about the greed and how much they can make. GamerFirst, commonly now called HackersFirst and MoneyFirst are nothing more than Greed Monkeys who, if you pay lots of money to through ingame items, will allow you to freely hack on their servers until they do a massive cleanup and ban you. But alas, I recently was informed and shown an email from a clan members friend who was banned where G1 had banned him, during the cleanup, and offered to release his account if he paid a penalty and agreed not to hack again. According to the clan member, he paid the fee, updated his hacks and then carried on hacking.  The owners and operators of this game do not care about you reporting players, nor do they care about players who spend little on the game. Those who spend the most rule the game and ruin it for others. Do not play this game and do NOT spend money on it at all.
7897	0	a	Ok... APB Reloaded is a peculiar game. It's fun and completely awful all at the same time. The most controversial aspect of this game is it's usage of the Free-to-play model, a significant change from it's original incarnation as a subscription based game. However, this model always begs the question: Do you actually have to pay money to play this game against other paying players? In this case, the answer is unfortunately a resounding 'Yes!!!' Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money. This type of F2P model is horribly unattractive to me. If you offer a game for free, don't restrict the fun to the people that play.
9009	1	a	when i login i cannot play the game it just says type in your password to log in if you knojw how to fix this please tell me
10675	1	a	This game is super cool and fun to play!
1161	1	a	played it on my old pc and i'll play it again!
2995	1	a	its a good game and dont argue thats a p2w game because if you do it right you preaty mutch have the same gumes 
9471	0	a	Downloaded off of steam, made account at whatever website it redirected me to, website only used my email and password. The game itself is asking for a username, but I've never been given an option to make a username, and when I go to make a new account it brings me to the same crap where it only uses my email. Can't figure this out, I'm probably just autistic. Still very dissatisfied that this whole sign in thing was very poorly designed, if I can get helped with this or get it fixed if this is a legit problem, I'll write another review when it actually lets me play the game.
9568	1	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is so good. open. great combat. smooth. addicting. yeah get it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the negative reviews lol this game is awesome. IT EVEN HAS GREAT LIP SYNC GUYS. PLEASE. THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ MADE ME GET THE MINDSET TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE ''REVIEWED'' NEGATIVELY AND TRY IT MYSELF FIRST AND HAVE MY OWN OPINION ABOUT IT. but i do read the positive reviews first to put myself up and the game.
1188	1	a	Killed by half naked womens  its ok 9/10
4451	0	a	Matchmaking does not exist.  30 min in i started fighting gold rank people. Pay2Win (inbefore: OMEGED ITS NOT PAY2WIN LIRN TO PLAY). All gold rank people play in bronze/silver rank servers (gold rank servers are EMPTY, wonder where they all are hmmm, oh right).  You will be sniped from every corner possibe. Mission objectives will be taken on rooftops with 1 entrance where you will get rekt all the time trying to get up there. Much more can be added. I simply won't waste my time. Don't believe me? then proceed.
1617	1	a	I'm confused, I can't get think is this a game, I thought more as a joke, even the years past playing it, i lost a lot of time, but really i did? But hey, this is really cute. I think it approaches as an astral mystical experience, and i don't think it's only me.  PS: This game will have a higher chance of get your brain f***ed hard, so, be aware.
1772	1	a	I like the game but it has a lot of bug that needed to be fixed!

2104	1	a	Must try
10121	0	a	Boring and mediocre.
469	1	a	An enjoyable free-to-play game with a high level of customisation which can be rewarding at times. Have caution, however, as this game can be  highly  frustrating, and it's not without problems. To add to that, the devs seem to spend their time adding expensive paid content rather than fixing issues and bugs.   So, should you get it?  If you have some mates and are looking for a enjoyable casual gaming experience, then no. This game will make you rage! Download if you wanna get your competitive side on, but be prepared.
6240	0	a	This game fockin sucks, like foreal so many haxors you all can smd, like foreal yaknow what I mean you fockers
1152	1	a	Downloaded game, entered the city, got into a mission, I rekt a guy, guy accused me of hacker.   10/10 would Rekt him again.
150	1	a	Very well made has alot of customizations of characters and vehicles i like the game in general but 1 underlieing issue i find is the unbalance of pvp where law enforcement players choose exactly when to start pvp putting the criminal in a state of unplayability because if you occupy your attention on something else the player will 'turn on pvp' at that exact moment and gun you down without you even knowing what is going on. Basically you CANT PVP as a criminal freely against law enfocement players you are under there control all the time. IDK why they dont just make the pvp always on for all players why cant a criminal roll up on a law enforcemrent player and shoot freely? it is very unbalanced game because of it and it forces the criminal player to not be able to enjoy the game at all if a law enforcement player decides to follow them around and make there gameing expierience unenjoyable when the whole point in playing a video game is to have fun its illogical to make a game where a player that chooses 1 side is automatically disatvantaged and has to try to play the game at the 100% control of another random player.
9655	1	a	very addicting game
426	1	a	Love this game, this game is fantastic :p
7099	0	a	Played a long time before it hit steam, before it hit the wreck of a company called gamersfirst. If you see a game run by gamersfirst just know their real name is gamerslast.
776	1	a	This game is interesting...could do some more work on it though.The servers are really laggy.But hopefully it will get better.Keep up the good work.:)

7369	0	a	play gta v its way better
4080	0	a	Bad Community, Poor mechanics. COOL idea!  But I dont get it. The PEOPLE in the game are what are the worst. I'd rather deal with the crap from the DayZ player base....
3204	1	a	Made my character look as much like me as possible, 5 min. loading screen, entered game.  No matter what you do, your character will look like they've just done heroin 500 times. 10/10 what will you look like on drugs simulator
7287	0	a	The game took 6 hours to download, made me install another launcher, took another 1/2 hour to finally be able to play. And after all that it told me i didn't have the right computer capabilities.
9960	0	a	Ok sooooo, I installed went to play and it asks you to create an account. No problem lets do that. Wait, it is saying I already have  1......what?  I have never played this so how do I......ok let me attempt guessing it. Nope, not happening, so I try doing a password reset. IT WORKED, maybe now I can â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play this game already. But wait.....what is my username associated to that password? I try everything I could think of, Steam name, E-mail and random usernames I usually use. Nope, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I give up â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME, UNINSTALLED. You know you have wasted your time installing when the game doesn't even want you to play it.
7196	0	a	Dreadful. Punkbuster, whom i assume is the equivalent of valve. Doesn't include the full game in the steam download. You actually have to manually patch the game or you get kicked every 2 or 3 minutes in game which takes about a 30 second load screen in and out. The game looks cool but literally one of the worst installs on steam
10508	1	a	Despite the name, I don't feel like I've ascended very much.  I did, however, slide majestically into a landmine with 250 km/h and witness my dead body scoot into a nearby pit of lava.  It's a shame there isn't very many players any more, because it's still a very fun game.
4911	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
9857	1	a	If you enjoy large-world games this may be one for you. The crafting system is large and complex and the dusty plains provide a very fitting frame for the story. There's the option of going for missions or crafting as you level up, either way will make your character progress as you play. The GUI was daunting at first but after a few hours it felt more comfortable to use - but never easy or intuitive. As it stands now I'm on the verge of putting real money into the game, since I feel the developers have created a world that pulls me where other post-apocalyptic games have had a plastic, artificial feel to them. If you enjoy exploration and crafting, definitely try out this free to play version at the very least!
9054	0	a	looks amazing first 5 minutes then u say â¥â¥â¥â¥ it.

7003	0	a	I managed to get a few hours playing this game, and what I found out to my content, was very sad. This game was very fun in the beggining, it had nice graphics, the game play was fun, and I thought it was going to be a very fun and good game. A few more hours of gaming and I learned that the only way to actually get anything is with real money, THIS IS A PAY-TO-WIN GAME, what pay-to-win generally means is that the only way to get stuff or be good in the game is to buy stuff with real money. After I kept playing I saw that the community was complete trash, too. As well as the greedy producers of this game. I do not recommend this game for any reason, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money playing the game and googling things because no one is opt to help you.
4463	0	a	As of right now, I'm giving you a bad rating Gamersfirst. I've been loyal to you, spent over $60 on your great game. I love it to pieces, but today everyone was banned. Fix this, and I'll redo this review, and give you an honest rating about the game.
8265	0	a	Alot of hackers , couldn't play or do a thing -.-
10594	1	a	a wonderful game where that you can use 'sking' to better your dodgeing on the battlefield, the bad thing is if you dont invest in weapon training and ski training you will screw your self over big time (i know this the hard way slideing in to a heavy class and getting melee killed like a noob)  i give this game 7 bullets out of 10
10411	1	a	Fun game, good time waster for free.
9253	0	a	The games graphix are some what decent , the community a bunch of douches lvling no fun at all and is a pvp based game and the moderators complete imbosiles ... exept for that great game ... o wait thats most of it ... ... o and ALOT of people hack the hell out of that game to ..
3822	0	a	This game was really a blast. The best part was when I got really high level were everyone had an aimbot or threw around $4,000 dollars to the developers to get really overpowered sniper rifles and machine guns. If you are not willing to buy the $500 dollar guns then you cant have fun in this game.

1340	1	a	Its like a GTA but free
4883	0	a	This game is an awful P2W madhouse. The only reason I have so many hours in it is that the game did not shut down properly and was still read as 'running' by steam. I did not pay a single penny but I still felt ripped off.
9113	1	a	After playing this game on and off since 2012 (and not using the steam launcher as much as I could cos it chugged the game for me for soem reason) I have to say teh game is dieing.   The gameplay itself is a blast and you will have fun for the first 15-20 levels, I can promise you that. The graphics are good,, though not amazing, the crafting system is one of teh best I've seen in an MMO that is not Eve Online, it does the whole real time crafting thing real well. The community has always been pretty toxic when you step into the PvP aspects oft eh game but that is to be expected as some people have grudges with others that span years now or they simply hate a faction regardless of who is on it (there are 6 total factions though now a days they do not matter due to low player count in game and removal of faction based bonuses, the only advantage now is the armor cosmetics and which faction chat your can talk in). The PvE community however is prettygood and open to help people.  Now the bad. G1G (the company that bought FE from Icarus Studios) have been doing the minimal to keep the game ticking over and making money. The game was meant to be spread over 9 total zones and having an in depth and intriguing plot and story line. When G1G bought the game I belive 4 of the zones where done (don't get me wrong the zones in this game are HUGE and pretty well detailed). Now since 2012 to now, only 1 of the new zones has been added and it's one totally thought up by G1G and has practically zero addition to game play. It is effectively a mix of 2 zones or 2 parts of 2 zones I should say, saying that it does look good, it just has no body or soul, it's just that, looks and some newarea to grind in to get a new tier of gear. It's nice however it took over a year to finish and just looks like a rehash.  Now another thing that is a MAJOR killer in this game is MASSIVE CONSTANT LAG. I'm not kidding when I say if your playing early morning in the US or late at night in the US, you will have in game lag whenever you go to loot a body (1-10 seconds to loot where normally it's instant) or if you gather a resource node. It also happens in the chat with 1-5 second lag between hitting enter and the post appearing, if it appears at all (I've had messages just go into the ether and no, not muted or anything, just parts of a convo just never get delivered). These problems result in G1G having to restart the servers at least once a day where they have to take them down for up to 90 minutes, sometimes longer, just so the game doesnt crash.  Now saying all that I must say give the game a shot, it is a good game and the latency issues are newish...well month or two of it happening every day, butif you love post apoc games and just want to drive around mad max style in a car or beaten up dune buggy with a 50 cal on the roof, this is the game for you. It just sucks how most people don't give it a good run past level 20 as at 40+ (level 55 is max level currently) is where it starts to open up and give you freedom to do whateer you want.
8691	0	a	Wellfare GTA 5 Online.  With somehow even more hackers.
9864	1	a	Very interesting game.  It makes me feel as if im playing a Fallout Online-ish type game.  The game is pretty old (released in 2011!), but it still shines with the better MMOs wih some decent gameplay. The graphics arent the greatest as well as the UI being a bit on the griany side.  I will say this again: I prefer having solid gameplay over amazing visuals. This game has it in spades.  The map is HUGE, and im only in the first area. i hear there is 3 or 4 maps?  I was a huge fan of the skill system in the edler scrolls games ( the more you do something, the better you get at it, and the better stuff you can make/ use), and am glad its implimented in this game; though its not very clear that you have to buy the skills first off ( in game money ) from trainers. Im pretty sure that is covered in the toutorial, but i blew through that bad boy like i was a seasoned WoW quest grinder /sadface.... yes click yes click yes click  From what a friend who beta tested and played copiuos hours afterwards told me, was, that the character system is much like The Secret World, where you can continually change your skills in and out as you see fit. You're not stuck with one type of weapon or another. You want to use an LMG? Find the skills required, build them up, then equip the gun. Same with armors and everything else you can use.  Oh, and basically this is a crafting MMO. You RARELY if ever get guns dropping off mobs. You build al;most EVERYTHING. See that guy off in the distance on the Harley? Yeah, you can make one eventually. Get ready for some serious time drain though. Each item you craft has a real life time to make. Based on your applicable skills (for the type of crafting you are attempting), you can lower the amount of time it takes to make stuff. Just dont be suprised when you see that the engine you need to make for your sweet ride takes 24 hours to craft. BUT: you can craft and quest at the same time. Thank the gods.  Im very interested in seeing how the Mutant powers work. Yes, mutant powers. Basically spells. And there is quite a few branches of types. some are for damage, some are healing, some are buffs, and others are a good balance in between. I have no experience with them yet, so sorry im no use to you there.  With a little under 5 hours ingame, i would have to rate this at the following:  GRAPHICS: 7/10 not awful, but not anything super polished like the MMOs that have relased in the last few years.  GAMEPLAY: 8/10 Some minor glitches here and there, which shouldnt be since this game is this old...  CONTROLS: ugh... 6/10 Get ready to remap some keys right off the bat. Once you get the WASD set to NORMAL (A &amp; D to turn, not strafe), its easier. But, never forget that Shift isnt Run. the '/' key changes your speed through 3 settings.  SOUND: 9/10 I'm only in the first area, so i havent heard much other than some random screams when mobs die, a few towns people, and some weapons being shot off. What i have heard is great though.  overall i will give this game a standing 8/10. I will update as i play through, though im sure the 'score' i gave it can only go up; based on what ive heard from my buddy who has a maxed out toon.
10156	1	a	pritty cool for free have a go if u no likey u uninstally =)

5651	0	a	This game used to be a ton of fun. I would like to say that I wasn't that bad at it, and enjoyed a lot of it. That was a while ago...  The Pay 2 Win aspect seemed to be heavily promoted as new, better, faster, and stronger weapons were released for those who could afford them. I never bothered paying real money on this game. The only two weapons I actually bought and tried, were a sniper rifle and an submachine gun. Now, these guns were decent, but very overpriced as I could only use them for a short amount of time. Besides, why pay for a gun when I can do just as well with the default? Either way I was helpless if I was playing against someone who had premium..  The customization in this game is unmatched. You could sit in the outfitter or garage for hours tweaking and playing with designs and customizing. The things you could unlock from the missions is the only reason I actually did them most of the time. The increasing amount of lag made driving, combat, and missions a hell for me as well as my friends.   Recently, the only fun I had actually gotten out of this game is when my friend and I would â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with others, not taking the game seriously. Actually playing the game was frustrating and sad..

8631	0	a	I barely played this game. When I opened it the load times were awful and it ran terribly and I seem to remember it crashing once or twice. When I finally got the game going properly I was completely at a loss for what to do and none of the other players were of any help. Overall 2/10, bad community, bad game.
7316	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.

2862	1	a	Free? Oh dear, not another bad ga- Wait, this one is actually... Quite enjoyable! Customizable cars, characters, logo's and themes? Woa! With a competitive free-roaming Multiplayer with it? Hundreds of weapons to choose from?! I'm in.

452	1	a	Takes a while to get used to if you are new to the play style, but a tonne of fun once you do. However, this is only really a game that you should play with friends, Solo play is possible, but you are likely to get stomped, and just have less fun in general.

10579	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ is so Fast holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this is my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fantasy wrapped up into a game. 420 no scoping â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s from across the map miggggguhhh 10outta10
5646	0	a	not worth playing...
3572	1	a	Overall a really nice game. Has a nice character customization. I would compare it to a Saints Row / GTA mix. Great to play with friends and is overall very fun.
4189	0	a	Doesnt load crap, freezes up lots, slow loading screen
9508	1	a	Entertaining and challenging
728	1	a	I really liked this game, there is some problems with hackers but it looks like they get banned often. Combat is a little off balance but overall this is a great game.
18	1	a	actually terrible
745	1	a	Honestly I didn't like this game at all, I don't know if I just joined a bad server or something, but it was just a major pain in the rear.  -I lagged constantly even with good internet and 30 or less ping -There were a lot of players that either spent money or farmed a lot that had MUCH better weapons than noobs making it unfair when they went and saught after the new guy while he/she is learning how to play. Out of the 100 minutes I spent on the game, I spent 60% of the time dead... -The graphics were not very good (mind you I played about a year or two ago... I do not know how much this game has changed since then...)  Other than that, the community seemed nice at the time, I just didn't find it fun.  6/10 I will recommend it, but probably wont play it again since it annoyed me so much XD.
2651	1	a	Nice to play !!
7197	0	a	Wow this game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. First of all, they don't even give you a tutorial so your just pushed into the game with no instructions what so ever. When you first get into the world, there isn't even a clear understanding on what to do. Do you go to the mailbox? Do you go to this place? You have no idea. Not only do you get no tutorial of any kind but you also are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed if your on your own. There's a reason this game died once, it was a giant pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Why try to polish â¥â¥â¥â¥ Reloaded?
1529	1	a	The hacking is out of control. 5/10
9012	1	a	Have you ever been playing Fallout? Did you think `Why isnt there a game like this with Multiplayer included?Â´ Well...This game is exactly what you were waiting for. The graphics of Fallen Earth isnÂ´t as good as in Fallout New Vegas, but who cares? You can travel through an area 5 times bigger than that ( I donÂ´t know exactly...maybe 6 or 7 times bigger). The crafting system is the biggest one you have ever seen. It is bigger than in Minecraft! :O. Play it on First Person or Third Person ( Third Person is better ;D ). The best way to enjoy that game is...Play with your friends and enjoy the huge questing system!
10425	0	a	What kind of game has all sounds but random yelling off by default?
4321	0	a	When developers make a game free-to-play, the goal is to make it fun and fair for people who dont want to pay, but allow for bonuses for when you DO PAY. This game is STRICTLY pay to win. Impossible to do anything at all from the very start as a free to play player.  EDIT: You get completely destroyed by all the other geared up players as a beginner, and the game offers nothing to give you even the slightest bit of an edge in combat until payed for.
4060	0	a	To easy to exploit
1168	1	a	A new gen GTA....well guys give it a shot!
2318	1	a	Awsome game!!!!!!!!!!
4146	0	a	This game is very fun and very addictive, but it is just full of hackers and everything you work for just gets taken away or 'expired'. For a free game, it has potential to be one of my favorite MMO's. But I kept finding myself very aggrivated and upset that the guns or cars I worked to buy just 'expire'.  In my opinion, if you want to buy things for the game with real life money, then you will like this game. If you are looking for a good free MMO. Then I would not recomment this game.
1600	1	a	The best mmofps game ever, really.  I agree to people saying 'game is ptw blah blah blah' BUT there are a lot of weapons already to choose which works very good, just you need skills, TBH didnt play this game for 1 year, then downloaded and i still had skill to be on top with 40 kills in a mission lol.  Matchmaking is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are always people matched in groups which has everything maxed out... This game would be the best if it didnt have threats... No gold, bronze or silver, because of this matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥, there must be only one order of ranks, like csgo, has and other mmo games.  Game is really competetive, and as i said, its the best one you will ever find as mmo fps as you can drive a car do some crazy stuff. I am running on pretty old pc sure using some low settings, but game is still having some laggs even people says that on even a gaming pc this game would lag, and im waiting for an update for engine... so yeah. Devs should look more into quality not into money.
6176	0	a	Its a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
5027	0	a	i spent 2 hours trying to open this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game and it still did not work
8677	0	a	The game and the idea behind it is good. But the Pay-to-Win system just kills the experience for all newcomers. Basically premium players are guarantee to win, and in frustration all new (none-premium) players don't last too long, and forced to abandon the game. This game will die, unless they change the Pay-to-Win system into more fairer progression level system and true and fairer matchmaking..
5449	0	a	if you play this game and waste money on it your the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person ever . in this you can camp roofs and shoot noobs drive a car have SUPER LAG!. its really bad and the servers are hosted from the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing moon.
2720	1	a	Greatest cops and robbers/gta style game of all time. Vast customization and utilization of diverse resources. One midgame-ending flaw: company abandoned its own game as far as rebalance and you have to pay to win at mid-game level.  Definitely worth a play but don't expect to love it as much as you want to love it.
6783	0	a	This game was a HUGE waste of my time. I couldn't even play because the servers kept kicking me out. Any time I DID get into a game, I was disconnected in 30 seconds.
9160	1	a	Its an okay game once you figure out what you're doing.
3602	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
5543	0	a	My hairline cutter made me play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was legit, but one flaw. I try to noscope someone and it doesn't work. Wtf? This is the worst game i've played since call of duty ghosts. I feel like i just cut both of my wrists while making a remake of GTA. ok? Stop trying to make a GTA and get a life. if i cant make yawspeed, what is life? i cant 360 just by pressing Q? WTF! This is the worst. @FaZeRain @FaZeAdapt @FaZeApex @FaZe Banks @Faze Blaziken. I hope that this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ on in 2 hours. I am not ever going back to my Hairline Cutter AGAIN, because he told me about this â¥â¥â¥â¥. before you get this game please look at this..... @EverySteamMemberThatViewsThisStorePage
5032	0	a	Great game, looks attractive, nice gameplay and such.. But ehh.. Doesn't really want to run.. So...ehhh.. Yeah..
756	1	a	I like it.....its a more mission revolved GTA. And it's free... thumbs up!
5524	0	a	This game is fun, I'll give them that. It's like an F2P GTA with no real way to go. I played this game a lot, even though I only have 5.9 hours, reason being, I left the game for awhile. I didn't play for a real long time and I just played other games, which is okay, but when I tried to come back, BOOM, no server ever responded. I tried everything I could to try to play this game again, but the servers wouldn't budge. I made a new character, I made a new account, I tried to talk to the devs, they wouldn't respond, nothing would happen. So I eventually had to give up this fun game. So if you plan on getting this game, if it works, don't plan on playing for more than, hmm, about a year? I dunno, I just wish they could fix this game.
182	1	a	APB:R is a mechanically solid game with amazing customization options -including an option to upload your own music and play it with an in-game radio, but it's seriously marred by punishing hardware demands and one of the worst communities not actually directly affiliated with an organized Hate Group.  APB:R's got a mean learning curve, too, and not just in terms of gun fighting. High skill players also know the city and it's many alleys, highways, ramps, and neighborhoods quite well, and being travel time efficient is one of the greatest advantages for completing missions. You'll need to know the weapons as well and that's also not a trivial task.  The setting's quite detailed as well and fairly intriguing. There's a lot going on in this tale of a city committing suicide to save it's life and it's told from many different perspectives by a few dozen well composed NPC's. Shame it's also not an ongoing story.  A word on microtransactions: there are quite a few of them, and more coming all the time. Much of it is exclusive, but usually cosmetically. If you don't care what your OCA or NTEC looks like, you can unlock -permanently- weapons that'll perform just about as well as anything that costs real money. In terms of what's 'necessary' Premium time nearly doubles your income and contact progression rate, and that'll really start to tell once you get deep into the game and start seeing max level 15 contacts.  And much as APB:R's servers look like a dumping ground for unwanted (and tragically unaborted) children get this straight: it's a business, not a public park. Servers cost money, money means selling stuff. Get over it, or uninstall.  APB:R has a real and an active hacker problem. The worst offenders are the Americans, so keep off the game during American holidays and afternoon hours. Fair Fight helps, but it's bad to the point of hacker cadres bragging about how they stay in APB:R just to â¥â¥â¥â¥ with the devs, and who can point you at all their favorite forums and programs.   In Global Chat -just ask.  (Here's a good unofficial metric: read through the comments for this game that accompany any dev announcement or piece of news. Assume half the people denying hacking are doing it themselves. Say that's about %10, 1 in 5x2.  Now go play, and remember that number when you realize that these folks are the most active players when you see a newly minted rank 80 burn through your entire team with an unmodded Joker rifle. Sure his K/A/D is 17-3-0, but he's 'just that good.' Especially with one of the worst weapons in the game*. So _pro_. That he's also driving a completely stock version of the basic free car also means nothing -he just decided to reroll.  So what's suspicious about an unbelievably expert player with a Gold skill ranking in a game built on long-term progression and customization who likes to use a completely basic gun and restart at random? And who apparently can track you through walls? Can make jumping max-range hits on targets behind 90% cover with a sniper rifle?  I sound salty; I am.  I've seen this scenario play itself out _dozens_ of times.  If APB:R finally succumbs I'll miss it because truly there isn't much like it anywhere.  But I won't wonder why.  I'm recommending APB:R because there is a lot to love, but it's drowning in a sewage sump of the worst people you can find online. And no mistake, 'drowning' is no exaggeration. The devs keep patching and updating slowly and regularly, but the handicap of it's unbelievably vile community must cripple the growth it needs to stay online. F2P is a great model that only works if new people show up to buy, and given few actual new players stick around and that there's an upcoming global server merge doesn't say to me that it'll survive if it doesn't find some effective solution to it's many gloating and vocal cancers.   There's a play engine upgrade coming (eventually) and that'll probably be the make-or-break point when the stresses of the (realistically) many implementation bugs makes players who didn't log in to â¥â¥â¥â¥ with someone else wonder if they've got the patience to deal with everything they don't like about APB:R showing up while everything they play it for is in a limbo of bugs and disconnections.  Bottom line: bring your A game and your thickest skin, and stay off the servers during weekends unless you bought better aimbots than the other guys.  *The Joker SR-15 is inferior to just about every other rifle in every way except these: RoF and magazine size. Critically rifles, not SMG's or AR's, don't have iron sights.  They're meant to be light marksman's weapons with above average per-round damage that do poorly at close range. Our friend being described above will be running and leaping as he hip-fires his weapon. That has no crosshairs and a deviation box the size of a baseball diamond. At max RoF. ... GG.
9754	0	a	I see other beta testers here, sorrys all around.  I had bad expieriences with their GM team, basically playing pocket sausage with their alt- characters and clans. I have heard from others that they have the same problem.   Link is picture of what I am talking about  http://i.imgur.com/z3Wc69A.png    Basically, the game is run like a spoiled kids plaything, because GMs ingame have little oversight and do not really care about keeping up the playerbase. It is rotting in its prime. And a shame, because it had really great mechanics when it first was introduced years ago.
4512	0	a	A poor man's GTAV, but in GTA you only need to spend $60 once and you're good to go! In APB you don't pay for the game but to enjoy the game you have to shell out about $200 give or take. Everything cost real money or just spent a very long amout of time to get it. There is very few different objectives and you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The game really isn't that good and is very boring. Just do yourself a favor and not play this or you might go brain dead...   So basically the game is poop
5603	0	a	  Open world tps game. This game features two factions, cops and criminals. One can enter world as any of the two. Characters are highly customisable. It has almost 6 maps, but matchmaking on in only 3 maps or districts (as called in game). Game play is average not so smooth. Matchmaking is worst. Beginners are mostly matched against gold and silver badges (bronze&lt;silver&lt;gold). The main problem is that old players who are gold and silver badge, have many accessories like body armour, fast cars, grenade launchers, etc etc which make it very difficult for new players to get kills against them. Eventually they feed on you, kill u a thousand times as new players get some basic guns and a trash car.   Final verdict : This is a pay to win game. If u can buy items with real money then u stand a chance. And is basically poorly developed GTA .   Sorry for long post. Heres ur kawaii potato
3000	1	a	Kind of hard to get into the game, but when your in you can have some fun.   Not the best, but not the worst.

7535	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
6137	0	a	It's very pay to win in some aspects,but let me get the pros and cons sorted out here...  Pros: -It's fun at first when you're just goofin' around... -Kinda funny to look at glitchy vehicle system -Funnily bad in a lot of aspects such as Driving,Shooting,Threatening Civilians,Doing anything that leads to an 'animation' etc. -It's free (For the most part) Now onto what everyone wants to actually hear about...  Cons: -VERY pay to win -Lots of things in this 'open world' look very bland,lifeless,and boring. -Looks like a game from 2006-2007 -Has kinda bad optimization (even on a $1000 rig) -Bad hit boxes/hit detection -Pathetic AI -And much more i'm not willing to type :)

6337	0	a	look only at the negative comments on this game dont listen to the positive one's.
2177	1	a	This game is really good in my opinion I havent played the game properly you know but its still a realy good game and very fun. very customizable.
2817	1	a	the best f2p i ever played,its a gta style based mmo,wich will grant endless hours of fun for the lovers of the style. the costumization is awesome,wich gice u the power to make very cool distinct chars or vehicles,etc... have its flaws,and requires a powerfull pc to play even in lowest settings,but the size of the worlds and the concept manage to keep the game interesting and fun.  i have 4 chars 2 accounts,and more then 2000 hours combined,it says alot about the game. im a gta lover,and this is the ultimate multiplayer for playas like me. at least till something can compete with it.  many will say its a pay to win game,but i have several premium weapons,and none of them is so overpowered like some people try to pass the image. btw if u wanna try premium search for the real retail pack in the web,will give u a premium primary weapon account lifetime,premium side arm,premium car,500g1 and 30 day premium account (wich allows to win money faster,and wider costumization) if u buy the rt1 (retail pack) check utube videos t see wich weapon is best for u. the normal player preference is (scout,csg,whisper,ntec) by the order i putted.  its very hard game to enter,with a long learning curve,but after u manage to pass that part,will become a game that u will return over and over again. a must have,and one of the best f2p in present time in my humble opinion. peace.

8382	0	a	Oh APB, the years I've spent playing. LAGGGGG. This game is the definition of bittersweet. Customization is the best thing this game has going for it. Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...
4598	0	a	Gameplay is pretty linear and there is more fun to be held in customising than actual combat, which is mostly dominated by hackers which dont seem to get banned.
7114	0	a	This was good when I played it in the closed beta under RealtimeWorlds, but since it got taken up by Gamersfirst all it has turned into is a F2P with micro-transactions where paying gets you the best weapons and unlocks. I recommend to STAY AWAY from this game at ALL COSTS. The new dev/publisher has completely unbalanced the game's core gameplay by giving the premium players the best weapons instead of allowing everyone to gain and maintain the use of the weapons, not to meantion the overpowered premium vehicles compared to the free ones. This game was designed by RealtimeWorlds to be a Single-payment game - you by the disk/game key and that would be all you pay. This new system, as I've said already, has BROKEN the the game's CORE GAMEPLAY.  Score out of ten when under RealtimeWorlds: 8.5 Out Of 10 Score out of ten while under Gamersfirst: 2 Out Of 10  AVOID

3795	0	a	My old review got taken down by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs, so here it is. Got a new PC a few months ago, wanted to try out the game that I once adored with my good friend Bassdrop. I can't say that I am surprised, but once again the game is a dissapointment. If theres anything interesting, it's how much real money you can spend at the armas marketplace before going homeless. This game is a cash grab, plain and simple. You will not enjoy this game without spending atleast $100 and a $800+ PC because this game runs on an old â¥â¥â¥ Unreal engine that is outdated to â¥â¥â¥â¥ and you will never get above 40fps constant. In addition to that, you get amazing stuttering which is always fun especially when P2W users can buy the tommy gun(high rate of fire, big mag) and you get sprayed down and you can't do anything about it because it rapes your cpu. Engine upgrade should be something to get excited about, as the developpers have been promising for the last 2-3 years. No. Don't get your hopes up. This game is trash, the developpers are trash and the game is simply a cash grab. So far, it is working well for the developpers, everyone is buying their pay to win weapons â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and there hasn't been a single proper content update since 1 year. I wasted so much time on this game, I regret it. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't get into this game it will not turn out well for you.  Gamersfirst, Reloaded Productions, suck big fat â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of here.
4279	0	a	APB Reloaded is like GTA and Infestation had a baby. Its a robber vs. cops type of game. You team up with people on the same side of yours (cops or robbers) to do missions. The customization on this game is big! You can customize your car, character, and your guns skins. But there is a plus side to this game. It a pay to win game. Most the guns you buy expire in 10 days, when you customize your clothing or car you can't add too many things unless you pay.

Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.
6227	0	a	its not good about driving a car.please fix it

9578	1	a	worst game ever 10/10 would unistall again
1868	1	a	This is the greatest pvp mmo ever.  Best customization of all time, you can be anything or anyone. Community is quite horrible but also hilarious, think barrens chat in vanilla wow. Great for casual players who want to shoot up other players and blow up cars. You need a lot of practice to get good at all the different weapons and you need to put in a â¥â¥â¥â¥ tonne of hours to level up and unlock weapons like osmaw (rocket launcher). When you finally get a grasp of what to do it offers the best pvp experience ever, but be warned players who are grouped up in clans are very difficult to beat which offers a lot of challenge. Ive been playing for over 1 year now and it still offers challenges and difficulties because your always playing against other players who are very experienced. For new players they have a tutorial which is very easy to understand but also lets you join in the game immediately and play with others.
9878	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
3238	1	a	Wish there was a neutral recommendation button. This game is a lot better when played with friend, that's for sure. They can help you play the game and it makes the overall experience of that game much more enjoyable. Not exactly new-comer friendly, so be prepared to have your â¥â¥â¥â¥ handed to you. A lot. But, the missions are quite enjoyable, and I found myself enjoying this game quite a bit. I'd recommend playing it if you're curious, but be prepared to get killed when first starting out. Go ahead and give the game a shot!

516	1	a	APB:R Is a dynamic play style game. Some elements of the game include dynamic events (Like Witnessing Crimes for enforcers and mugging and ram raiding for criminals). The customization aspect of the game is incredible, you can make your own symbols using the editor or choose from a library of preset decals to place on your clothes or vehicles however you see fit. The gameplay is a mix of open combat and close quaters combat across foru different maps. Events are included like easter egg hunts around holidays like easter. If you like causing or stopping chaos or police roleplay you will like this game.
8041	0	a	This game might have been better, I like the idea, I think it has potential, but the studio simply cannot deliver it in a suitable form to players. This might have been better if the weapons were more 'balanced' (in the form of not having shotguns that don't work after 12m), and the 'premium' shop is filled with reskins (of free weapons) and overpriced cosmetics.
6638	0	a	Cannot even play the game. My brother uses a PC with MUCH lower specs than mine and he can play with no issues minus slight lag but anytime I try and join the game it freezes right away. I can't even review any of the actual content because IT DOESN'T LET ME PLAY! Two thumbs down (-10)/10

4655	0	a	APB Reloaded.  played it before. loved it nowdays its not a game i really like. it forces you to put money into it to be a more successful player in it. the optimization is crappy too. 
1189	1	a	The game is pretty addictive by itself, once you get used to the intermittent lag that once in a while makes you rage. But it isn't game breaking as some other people in the reviews portray it to be. Its a fun, highly customizable game that is receiving an engine upgrade and console port somewhere in 2015. Buying stuff for real money off their marketplace is HIGHLY optional and I've never found the need for the guns, which by far are just better looking and sounding reskins of the existing in-game guns. There are also a significant number of community-wide contests held by Reloaded Productions giving away small items that almost convince you to go back every time. There are always OMFG moments though, as sometimes you could be facing highly co-ordinated teams that everyone accuses of hacking and are really not but you learn to roll with it. I have additional 1200 hours on this game besides the Steam count and have completed the progression thrice with different characters. The GMs have, in the past, promised a lot of things to be given a long time ago (read: a year). They have not delivered yet. This includes more content that isn't just a simple reskin, an engine upgrade and a new anti-hacking system. The last was implemented in Q4 2014. Simply put, this game can be very enjoyable and very annoying as well. As a new player in this game, it works to your advantage if you haven't played MMOs before allowing you to keep the tolerence to learn the game instead of rage quitting. You will die a lot and you will be abused a little by other players, but if you learn, you'll love this game...

1519	1	a	its ok
4199	0	a	First of all imma just let people know if you love customizing and making cool stuff in a video game then this may be the right game for you. If your competitive play then this game is not for you. APB has to be the most fustrating online third person shooter i have ever encountered. I literally sit here and rage day and night. The game comes with horrible lag right now hackers and any other and most of these hackers return for round 9 yep round 9 they are that determined.   APB's gun play is the most horrible i can say comparing it to csgo, csgo has to be the bomb atleast their gun play makes sense and there is some pattern and strategy to be used but for apb i would just say majority of the guns act very unrealistic and are very difficult to master and for some of them even though you master them they still â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up in alotta ways.  The armas maket place is where you spend real money for guns,cars,clothes,etc. As many have said gamers first should just call themselves money first and even i agree that the cash shop prices are super unreasonable making this game look like its for the rich and famous.   The community is extremely toxic thanks to hackers who aimbot silently and you average 4 year jerk off who will just make you feel like crap cause your not at their level. Their are alotta cheap ways players can win a game in apb for instance you will find urself getting to a final mission where you have to capture an item and the opposing team or your team will take the item and run away with it and you now have to chase them and depending on the type of vehicle/ mods/ level of the play you wont even stand a nose hair of a chance at reclaiming the item making this game obiously onesided, trust me you can litterally see when you should just stop trying sometimes.  This game is still gun but like i said its fustrating. I can see myself leaving this game pretty soon.
7346	0	a	A bit laggy even with my newly built gaming computer, not a lot to do in this game either, honestly.
3783	0	a	The game itself is fine, however the community is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. And seeing as this game is online only you are forced to play with them so i think it's ok to downvote this game based on this alone. This games community is the worst i have come across so far. Download the game if you can put up with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s constantly or are in fact an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself and want to connect with other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!   Worst community 2015.
8453	0	a	Couldn't even get the game to start on Steam. Downloaded it off the official website and it took, like, 15 minutes after clicking start to actual boot up the game. Once I got it going it was nothing but laggy, even when I dropped the quality to the lowest it would go it. Not worth the effort.
914	1	a	Even if it's not the action that keeps you playing, just messing around in the social district and designing logos, tattoos and whatnot can be reason enough to dl this title. LOVE IT

THUMBS DOWN - why?  #1 - Punkbuster - I just got an email saying a My PUNKBUSTER BAN has been lifted and i am being given a second chance to return to APB. WTF??? What Punkbuster ban?  #2 - Pay to win.  #3 - Empty world. MAYBE 30-40 people in a district when it used to be 200.  #4 - Did i say Punkbuster and Pay to Win?  #5 - Too much P.

MA the game not wearth it. its gest not. [ps sorry for my bad english im not from america]
6420	0	a	The gameplay is pretty fun, and the store robbing mechanic is good too.  Sadly, to get better weapons, get cool cars, get different clothes, or anything really, requires you to pay money on the game. I am constantly in fear to get shot down by a guy who did actually pay money, because they have way better gear than me. Playing actual missions in online is also near to impossible, since most of the time one or two people who paid for the game have OP guns in which they carry their team or your team.  If you are looking for a REAL F2P game without others having an advantage for paying, then keep looking..
7748	0	a	A decent game to play, gets boring fast, so you will only play in short burts of up to 2 hours; then go back the next week. Don't expect to make friends on this game, everyone is a dik and if you want to have any fun, you will have to be one too. So just bring your steam friends, for a quick session of driving in vans and shooting random people out of the passenger door(s).
5470	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, have fun your â¥â¥â¥â¥ game folks.  Reasons it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game = â¥â¥â¥â¥ company who owns it, â¥â¥â¥â¥ community, â¥â¥â¥â¥ guns, â¥â¥â¥â¥ mechanics, â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, and greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2142	1	a	This is a great game if you want to have some competitive gameplay... it is Recommended that sometimes you play with friends because you may run across the usual Elite Gamer (Hackers Many people call them &gt;.&gt;) but the game offers a very in depth character customization and creation from what you wear to the car you drive! there are alot of diffrent guns that you can use and try and maybe even down the line if you find something you love you can put alittle money forward and get that gun, go out... shoot everyone up and RULE THE WORLD!!!!!  10/10 Will go on a rampage again
6609	0	a	its not as fun as they make it out to be
5778	0	a	Ya, how about no.
3450	1	a	great game not p2w guns for cash are jsut reskins...Legendary weapons are the only thing that is very Overpowered!
2396	1	a	It's good dumb fun. The matchmaking tries its hardest to put you against people your skill level, so don't fret if you're terrible, you'll be put against those who are as well. :)  It's a decent game, I'd suggest it to those who want to goof around and customize their character to all hell.  Wish it had a decent roleplay community, sadly.. no.
1882	1	a	THIS...IS...AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST FPS/ Free to play EVER!!

5351	0	a	This, my friend, is the worst game in the planet. I installed this â¥â¥â¥â¥, got fps drops af with a gtx 1070 and i5 6600, after that killed a team mate, because i was noob af. Then got some weird internet problem (im pretty sure it wasn't a kick, at least it wasn't saying anything like 'You got kicked blablabla')  Meanwhile i was talking with ma bois without any lag.  So i decided to uninstall!  Hope you had a good time reading this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, but serious just buy GTA!

1676	1	a	I don't remember buying or playing this game. I don't know how it ended up on my Steam Account â it doesn't ring a bell at all! I have purchased far too many games on Steam and this is what happens when you do! Despite having no memory of it, I'll surmise it's a really great game. It might possibly be, the best fun I cannot remember having! Could it even be possible, that I've also played it more than Killing Floor?
8093	0	a	This game used to be great, but now it feels like it's falling apart. Just today, I was d/c twice while I was on the winning team. I don't d/c when I'm losing tho &gt;_&lt; The hitbox is simple, and lots of people whine at me just cause I play sniper. I hope the servers stop crashing.  If you want to be successful, gotta spend money to earn money. I don't spend real money, but I do throw in ingame money on timed weapons cause it's worth it. I love the customization in game. The matchmaking isn't so great in that sometimes you get new players against a team with rockets and fast cars
3700	1	a	This review is a little bit long but here we go, Actually its more a getting-it-off-the-chest review than a real review  Once upon a time, there was a company called 'Hoplon' they decided to bring the game to Brazil, so they made a deal with gamefirst, you guys block every Brazilian IP from your servers, and we will force all Brazilians to play in ours(if they want to play). So we had to do so, We played on their servers(However, I really wanted to play on gamefirst's servers, 'cause hoplon wouldn't put new weapons and stuff in the game, they just would use same models and then give them new names and say 'new guns, give us money, I mean 'buy them'') we spent a lot of money on the game. We used to have awesome accounts, with a lot of gears and guns and whatnot. Then they decided to end the contract. And the great bomb was dropped, all Brazilians are allowed to play on gamefirst's severs, forced actually. But they haven't immigrated our accounts to gamefirsts yet So we are totally obligated to start from the zero, while there are already a myriad of gamers in their servers with top accounts. Which means our money and time on our real accounts were completely wasted up until now.  If they ever ever immigrate our accounts, I'll edit this review  They've immigrated the accounts,then it's working perfectly
1299	1	a	hi can you fix the APB reloaded it go all the way to the video and thin is go black

2433	1	a	awesome game but as too many lag
10758	1	a	It's free, fun and rewarding to play. Ski at speeds of 300 and 400Kph. Kill people with a hand-held mortar, Snipe players while they go insanely fast, Chase a flag capper at amazing speeds, do what you want when you want. My most played game, the only thing you need to do is hit the install button.
9438	0	a	Its pretty awful
10439	1	a	A very amazing game been playing the heck out of it past few days.Feels like fallout but with a way bigger customization for character gear and you get awsome vehicles and mounts just so amazing so many options. 8/10
7720	0	a	Confusing objectives and unfriendly community that doesn't take the time to think 'Oh, maybe this person is new?' Instead, they just scream at you and insult you. Gameplay isn't really anything that special, and it has a P2W feel about it.
7636	0	a	As soon as it was done installing, it would just show a small box and not the actual game so thats why I'm going to uninstall then reinstall to see if it works. If it does I'll send a Yes on recommending it, if it doesn't then I'm going to try to send a No on recommending it and go talk to someone about it.
4068	0	a	Unbalanced peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that provides a poor tutorial that is really buggy to new players and pits NEW PLAYERS AGAINST PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME SINCE IT CAE OUT! It also has weapons that are weak at the start, a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ interface, and you should just ignore this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play some tf2.
5096	0	a	It's like TF2: New players are noobs. If you're not P2P you're a noob - you are a F2P 'scrub'. Weapons are too OP, and fanbase is a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. GG

2409	1	a	This game i really cool but always the same thing happening everyday i play it's the same missions and not much to do but walk around and wait for a mission to come (would probs be the same mission you just did) but if ur really into art and love to create and costomsize the game has alot to offer with that i go through dissusions and see very cool emblems and character's or if u love killing idc c:.... i like it doe
7788	0	a	just another P2W, being a criminal in real life it's cheaper than this laggy game full of aimboter players, so go on and use those $10000 that you're paying for this game and use them for a real gun.
3055	1	a	Graphics 5/10 Average Story and tasks 2/10 Boring... Gun Play 4/10 I seen way better. Like BF and GTA and COD. Controls 8/10 Way easy to learn. Fun 4/10 Lots of grinding.   So average!! 5/10
8792	0	a	the leaning system is crap beacuse you have to aim in order to lean and it goes into a over the shoulder POV witch is crap i feel like what would make this game better is if it was both 1st and 3rd POV

6962	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.

1595	1	a	best game there is for free to play 
4387	0	a	This game is kinda like GTA, just not as polished, big or open-ended. Or....well okay it's not really like GTA at all, apart from you roam around shooting people and stealing cars. Battles are fought in a series of urban maps between two sides, Enforcers and Criminals.  The game has a really, really good character creation and customization system. You really can do so much, height and weight, facial structure, skin tone, moles and scars and all sorts. Clothes are the same, able eventually to be worn in a multitude of colors, with lots of different styles.  The bad points, IMHO, outweigh the good however. The community on this game is absolutely atrocious. Exploititive, foul-mouthed keyboard gangsters constantly filling the district chat with all manner of nasty comments and what is essentially verbal griefing. I can't really stress how awful this community is.  The second worst feature is the driving and combat. Cars are horribly unwieldy and slip and slide like you're driving on an ice rink. The combat is very annoying, as you -will- be destroyed by bouncing, aimbotting 'veterans' with P2W guns that you simply cannot match unless you want to fork out quite a large amount of money. The gunfights are not fun. They really on having suprise and killing within three seconds, any longer and the hyper accurate, ultra-damage gun wielding other players will kill you with suspicious accuracy.  I don't recommend this game at all. The community is a festering, weeping sore that is hopelessly entrenched, and the gameplay is either clunky or skewed horribly in the favour of pay-to-win veterans who scream gangster hood references over the chat at eachother while aimbotting and hacking the game. Avoid.  Not worth even being free.
9125	0	a	Um.. Where to even begin....    Pros;   -Free -Easy to learn -Good for teaching / good first game to get into if youre trying to learn how to games -Doesnt take up much space -Runs really well / Isnt CPU nor GPU sensitive      Cons;  -Poor/Uninteresting/Generic Story -Looks like... Well, Pixel games are better. -Extremely repetitive/boring gameplay. -Enemies have the skill and threat of a one legged kangaroo. -Theres only like... One of each type of gun.

3932	0	a	 Be aware i did not 'only' play 900 hours, i just used the regular G1 launcher the whole last year. 1500 hours would be more exact.   I also paid something like 350 â¬ over the past 3 years and i abandonned everything because this game isn't worth it anymore.  I deleted my previous review which has been written the 11th of december 2011 stating that the game was great.      'APB: reloaded' or the 'Ultimate money making machine'  
9191	0	a	tryed to load the game, dident work, deleted it, recently desided to give it another try, but only the review option was avalible.
4568	0	a	Here is what I think. APB Reloaded is a good Game, but I feel that I should both critisize and nit pick a lotta things about this game  One is the SMG charging and the repeditiveness to lose to another player because of the overpower of the SMG's in the game. It is so god awful and OP, It made me stop playing this all together. People would just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sprint at you, boomboom â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. They do it with shotguns even. It's stupid as all â¥â¥â¥â¥, also, the new Argotech ACES R&amp;D III is the most OP weapon in the game, and the most unfair, it directly hits, no need for anything else, no range no nothing. People running around with OSMAW Bazookas and silly Argotech ACES SMGs are cowards and are idiots for buying something for a cheap kill every five seconds.   Two is the Customization, specifically for males. I generally have a Randy Savage-Esque Character, but I want more than a Randy Savage look. I want to see hair that will SURPASS my shoulder/neck. I want to see long where is surpasses the shoulders to even the top half of the Pectoral. I really do not care what the general style of man is, give us that choice please. I have a problem with games that never seem to give a choice about Hair style for men, and just give the more mainstream stylings and as I repeat, absolutely sick of it. I want to see a helluvalot more.  Three is the Car handling, which is GOD AWFUL. Simple, It's so unecessarily hard. Go around a corner, you hit a brick â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall in 12 seconds and then your dead.   Four... The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unbalancing of the 'threat levels'. Bronzies all in one, but goldies and silvers mixed together... this game is way under balanced and stupid. it just is horrifingly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I kept on getting my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me because of the Goldies 'better skills' and there silly pay 2 win cheapo weaponry. This game HEAVILY relies on you having to buy weapons all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time and having them rented out instead of kept which is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb. You basically are vulnerable as a cop or a criminal. Oh but the Enforcers (cops) have all the advantages of quickly getitng everything. Yeah. The Goods It's Free, so if you are looking for a filler game, go ahead, get this It has the Best customization, despite what I say about Male customization. Sometimes, you can win by using simple weaponry and stuff. SOme of the Pay 2 Win items are pretty good if you think about it. Most importantly, it is a co-opish game, so you can play with friends  Overall, If I were to rate tis on a simpler basis, it would be atleast a 5/10 Because of the new crap that G1 and Reloaded added.   Thanks Reloaded, you guys do not know anything about fairness.  Edit: I am putting on the thumbs down, but it's your choice. at this point I am in the middle. ANd the reason there is so much bad is BECAUSE this game has too many rage inducing moments and the
3482	1	a	So, the most beatiful thing about this game are loading screens, character creation, ads and pure concept. Whatever else is just roughly mediocre. Yep, it may entertain you for some time, but... just try it.  (PS: I played this game long before it was merged with steam)
3958	0	a	  Feels like this game is really hungry for money
2132	1	a	People say this game is Pay To Win... But it's not, when i started to play this game i killed people that had Payed items which wasn't that difficult, However if you save money like me you can get really cool and good stuff from the shops in the game. For example if you spend real money on to the game its just giving stuff that looks better and its upgraded little bit too. I played this game for few hours and i am so close to get a really good car without spending no real life money. Hope this changed your mind about this game. :)
4855	0	a	This game is not free...
1427	1	a	I really like this game, the events are the fun part of it all....sure there are people who are like pay-to-win but that's not the case....better guns dosn't mean better player. The costomization is amazing....this is like GTA with more costomization
7029	0	a	SOOOOO much wasted potential. This game could have been what GTA online should have been, but too many flaws are holding it back.  The gameplay is very, very fun. Missions have you either breaking into buildings, hijacking cars, or hacking satellites if you are a criminal, or preventing criminals from doing so and arresting people if you are a dirty copper. While most of the time the missions are actually balanced and require strategic plays and superior aiming from both teams, there are plenty of times where mission objectives can be exploited by parking a car on top of the objective and shooting it til it explodes, rendering the mission impossible to complete. Not fair or fun. It is also very likely as a bronze rank you will get stuck against gold ranks with pay2win 1shotkill guns.  Also hackers. So. Many. Hackers. If you somehow manage to make it to gold rank, you will never be in another mission without an aimbotter. You won't. Ever.  Customization is amazing. Everything is customizeable from your character to the car they drive to the song the enemy hears when they kill you. But hackers. Always hackers everywhere aimbots hacks hacking hackers hacked bot botter aimot botting aimbotting hacks

7677	0	a	the game honestly sucks. Its pay to win and unbalanced in the Crimminals favor. they make money faster and when you add pay to win ontop of ythat making them earn more money and more experience it makes the game just no fun. Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying as hell. the hacker base is endorsed by G1 because they buy the mod and the money goes to G1 so theyre happy as long as the â¥â¥â¥â¥ers make money.
6301	0	a	i only played it because my friend hacks in it, still pretty bad tho
8891	1	a	how can a planet fall
6641	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
2079	1	a	This game is dardy. i have played it for 3 years now and i still cringe every time i get back on it &lt;3
4291	0	a	Pay2Win system of weapons
1715	1	a	My favorite game of all time. been playing for 4 years now.
4025	0	a	3 years ago probably one of the best games out there. NOW probably the worse one you can play if you play it for the shooting aspect. THE BAD #1 Get good with carbin or lose #2 Premium or die of old age #3 VERY toxic community (salty,tears,getgud,â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) typical vocabulary amongst #4 Porn #5 Animation canclation a thing #6 Seeing through certain walls (not fixed over years) #7 Unjust bans #8 cheat scripters not being banned? #9 very very lacking on updates #10 The more money you got (real cash) the more youl succeed -spent alot - notices difference   THE GOOD #1 Amazing customization #2 Good game to hang out with people #3 Car customization/Driving is awesome Thats it i give this game a big thumbs down - about 8K hours of game play over the past 5 6 years WORTH IT back then NOT WORTH it now .
9145	1	a	Excelent game if you have a group, not so much without one. yet i can still say it was enjoyable to play, at least for me. i was looking for a post apocaliptic mmo that is what i found so i was satisfied, did i mention it was free? (well free-ish, there are still microtransactions) recommend playing in a group of at least 2-3 people
5260	0	a	LIST OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME WITHIN TWO DAYS OF PLAYING: 1.) Ignored when i ask a question (that i see now as a very simple question to answer... like five words.) 2.) Openly expressed my feelings about only being to customize your car with a max of three shapes and got crucified. 3.) Met a group of four elite players with the same over powered weapon and wearing stockings and big ole baps! 4.) Made the mistake of trying to speak in chat like a normal human being. 5.) Look in chat and always see people yelling 'Hacker!' or 'Wow, nice wall hack!' 6.) AND SO MUCH MORE!  CONS: - The missions are ALL the same. - If you kick butt in the first two parts of a mission you need to win an all or nothing TDM skirmish or you don't get squat! - Friendly fire is ALWAYS on and the criminals and police both look the same (MEGA PENALTY IF TEAM KILL!). - Spawn kills - Poison community - Gave me more anger than joy. - Couldn't ask a friend to play this out of pure respect. - It IS pay to win! For real though! - Your only motivation is more petty trash to customize your character with!  - The game is built around customization yet restricts you to how much you can customize! WTF! - Made me want to kill myself and improved my life 100% when i stopped playing!  PROS: - Customization... rendered useless due to the poopynes of the game!
2321	1	a	very good and nice to play.
8134	0	a	i hate this game
6998	0	a	It was once a good game, now broken by bad devolopers, bad matchmaking, and greedy developers.
1639	1	a	lol this game still gets updated?
10528	1	a	this game is interesting because of its physics but if you pay alone it sucks
755	1	a	If you're not Trucking, you're doing it wrong. If you don't know what Trucking is, you haven't even played the game.
6735	0	a	APB is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1789	1	a	great game to do with a bunch of friends, love the customization abilities :)
8478	0	a	I may have clocked at least 195 hrs but heres my experience. I did get really far up only to rank 95 but I stopped playing as the rankings are unbalanced. You got gold threats trying getting into Slivers district to throw off the matchmaking and you got Slivers in Bronzes. The community is cancerous as players would call you 'noob', 'hacker', something around those lines. The lag is horrible, devs just pump more updates to take our money and don't actually do good contribution into the game. It's best you avoid this game unless you can actually handle it.
4559	0	a	i see this game looks like popular and cool BUT, , sad news, i can't play this game . I had downloaded it,updated it,and. . AFTER THE UPDATE , i CAN'T start the game. . the LOADING takes long time . i wait every hours . WHY THE HELL I CAN'T LAUNCH THE GAME ?
6585	0	a	its a really fun game, the world is expansive and you can customize the music, cars, clothes and many other things which is a pretty big plus.. but no matter how hard you work, its very oriented toward people who buy stuff in game, no matter how hard you worked for that machine gun by doing missions, you only get it for maybe a few days or a week, but if you buy it, its yours for good.  but ig your ok with that then this is your game, but I myself hate when someone a lower level blows me to bits with a machine gun and leaves me in the dust using a muscle car that goes double my speed, making it a quickly ending speed chase.  and even though it says I only played for an hour or so, I've had days of playing this game before I had it on steam, sad the say that it hasnt changed.
10045	0	a	It's an ok game but it gets boring and repetitive quite quickly :/
10056	1	a	  good game easy to level up and overall no big problems.
1074	1	a	dis a good â¥â¥â¥ game add me  gold threat jericho crim - SociallyUnstable - r217 enf - n0fl0ck - r70~ something
4341	0	a	A bad copy of an old game, rather than a good copy of a new one. How many times DO I need to shoot someone in the head with a rifle before they die? Guess I didn't insert enough money. New account creation from inside the game is awful. Keep trying
2161	1	a	APB reloaded is Very Closely related to GTA however it is far from it. The game can be fun with a team or group of friends. The team Is Highly Pay to win though. People whom Pay for Prem get Everything just about and Is/are able to have better weapons and when 2xs more money in game to get things. The biggest Issue with the game is team Balance. There is none. You get matched up with people that are WAY higher ranked then you're self and they Expect you to deal with the fact that that have Armor on and BEtter weapons that wipe you out in a heartbeat. Would I recommend the game yes but For more of a casual play on occasion sorta thing
3549	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again
9132	0	a	Hmm, Hmm , yeah well this game looks cool at first but uhh yeah you have to create a account on another website, which costs  money/and,or/wasting  time watching adds to get so-called 'credits' . complete waste of time considering its free on steam, but you cant even play it unless you go through this second rate gaming site and give them money so you can play this game and get bored after 4 hours TOTAL of gameplay . Honeslty im not poor , i have money, i just wish it wouldn't be under free-to-play cause ITS NOT FREE-TO-PLAY!!!! 0 freakin' stars out of five .
6156	0	a	Arcade-style twitch fighting with random explosions similar to the beginning of any Call of Duty match. Repetitive, boring, and infuriating.  It does have awesome customization for both vehicles and characters, but overall the gameplay is terrible and antiquated.  3/10
8260	0	a	How to play this game: -install -check if there are still only timed weapons for f2p -if yes, uninstall and try again next year  cya in 2017
3987	0	a	Not worth your time at this moment.
8955	1	a	i really liked after you get past the first two hours it alot more open worldly and more fun so ya
10589	1	a	Tribes was great until its developer saw the grand money filled world of mobas and dropped this for Smite. They didnt even make all the weapons free or anything to send the game off.   Rest in peace. 
6397	0	a	One of the worst games ever made.
4143	0	a	APB Reloaded has the worst community I have ever seen in a game. The game must have an assclown magnet coded in to it. Decent game, ****ty people, not worth the hassle.
3753	0	a	I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!
9023	1	a	This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some 'new' things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.  Now to the problems The enemy AI tends to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.   Over all this game has +Great gameplay mechanics +Interesting storys and characters +Great immersion +Addictive micro managing +Great trade and communication system  The middle ground Game lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem and is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.  Now the bad  -Terrible AI -Unhelpful NPC's -Strange level system -Fast enemy respawns  Overall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 
6856	0	a	used to be my favorite games before... but later in 2013 they ruined everthing, starting from the weapons they make the normal weapons do less range and damage from the weapon u buy from the market using real money, the lags, the random kicking in the middle of mission by punkbuster, and the worst part is the hacker that didnt get banned because they friends of the GM or they spent money on premium. now im gone for good. (colby player)
6945	0	a	This game flat out dosent work.
5008	0	a	A complete waste of time with faulty matchups, unexplained gameplay and aspects of the game specifically designed to taunt you.

7364	0	a	ive found someone who's played nearly 3000 hours of this game  i would have killed myself
505	1	a	Majority of their consumer base (the ones that actually pay for stupid crap in this game) were cheaters.  They were all banned. Ha ha. Take that, Reloaded.
10666	1	a	After a 2 year hiatus, Hi-rez has hired a dedicated team for this game. They have already released a new patch and are currently implementing PTR as well. The patch notes are insane for the PTR. I have hope that they will continue to update the game and provide a FPS experience that I grew up loving.
2458	1	a	seems really interesting so anyone wanna try it with me? 
5471	0	a	Change the name to APB: Hackloaded and you're all set.  Expect to loose a lot. Expect to get bsed out of kills. Expect to get aim botted. Expect to never win a mission. Expect a toxic community prob worse than COD players.  Expect to Uninstall this hack infested game. Give you computer a condem before you let it experiance this infested monstrosity.
9552	0	a	I like what it was trying to be, but the UI and combat is just so klunky it fails sadly.
1655	1	a	This game is really fun! Most people dislike this because of the graphics! If you go into the settings you can change it. Remember this game is free! I recommend this game
10591	1	a	I've spent over 500 hours on this game, having had no experience with the previous games in the franchise, and I can say one thing about it that I'm completely sure of: It's very, very good.  Hirez made a fantastic shooter, that, in spite of its high critical acclaim and praise, never managed to secure an audience large enough to merit its continued development, and caused it to only exist as a 'live' game for a year after coming out of open beta. The studio got a lot of flak for moving its focus over to another risky endeavour, which is the MOBA Smite, which paid off after Smite saw a lot of commercial success and propelled the studio from a small 20-man staff to employing over 80 people.   I recommend playing Tribes: Ascend without hesitation, as it is the best online shooter I've ever played, and in spite of some balancing issues, and lack of studio support, I will continue playing for as long as the servers don't burst into flames and die, at which point the game will probably die too.   Go in, have fun, shoot people, and try not to rage too much when hyper-skilled players gun you down with automatic weapons 4 times over. It's a lot of fun if you play it for fun.
1062	1	a	really great game try it out
8948	1	a	Such an underrated game. If you like to craft then this game is for you. Crafting in most MMO's is generally pointless and uninteresting. In Fallen earth you craft everything. All your clothes, all your armour, all your weapons and even your mounts. Want to travel the wasteland in a dune buggy well collect your materials, craft your components and put them together to drive your own set of wheels. This game is all about gathering, quests and crafting.  it has a very friendly community which will answer any question in the chat window instantly. Exploring and fighting is challenging at times but always good fun. the game can be complicated as it is so in depth. Easily the most in depth game i have ever played. The great thing about this game is that it is absolutely free, yes you can subscribe for extra benefits but you can play the whole game for free in its entirity. The graphics are a bit dated now but the gameplay more than makes up for it. its free, give it a go.
5174	0	a	full of cheaters
723	1	a	Whats to say about this game. Be ready to die alot. I mean ALOT. you get destroyed by people who buy guns on a free to play game who can kill yopu incredibly fast. But the customization and driving are amazing. You can customize everything, and it feels amazing to have your own logo on clothes and your car. Gunfights require alot of skill, so if you arent that good at video games, be ready yet again to die. But the parkour is so good, you can jump along rooftops, but you cant climb up buildings as in Assassins Creed. Map design is kinda bad, two maps with very bland environments, needs another map. And you need to grind and farm XP forever to get the clothes you want, and it takes forever unless youre premium. Good thing there are plenty of codes for free premium lasting from one day to maybe five days.
3775	0	a	Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game. For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..   Bad things after the change: -Good palyers have become â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...) -The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..) -The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...) -The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year.. -Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..  Good thing i can still say: -One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart. -Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.  There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be.
6826	0	a	Horrible game didn't even install correctly. It wanted me to install physx which i did then it told me to restart my computer which i also did and it still didn't work. I uninstalled it and will never even touch this game with a 10 foot pole.

Realised that there was too many decals, because I had a 'free account', didn't let me save it. Mediocre gameplay, shiÑÑy guidelines and rules. Do me a favor and never play this shiÑ, don't even eyeball it, what ever you're looking for, in the Steam Store, this isn't it.

7045	0	a	This is an ANTI-recommend. A game that keeps crashing on the character creator is a game that's hardly worth it. Considering its troubled history back from when it was a pay game, it's not worth it as free, either.

In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
5443	0	a	The driving is sad....got me just confused when i entered it bc i had no clue on what to due and i keep getting spawned killed
1101	1	a	The game just stoped working for some reason .. Something about an error but ive done the updates and everthing?....But other than that its a good game 
6923	0	a	APB Reloaded, a game where you join bronze districts to mainly end up fighting silver and golds, join silver districts to mainly fight golds and gold districts to end up fighting no one. Also the matchmaking, its broken, I ended up fighting two golds who had r255 (rounds I assume) and I had r33, my team consisted of me and two other bronze players who were also on r33, so it was us three bronze players who were using the starter weps vs two golds who were using high level guns with three modifications on them and they were also using player modifications, I'd tell you who won but you should be able to guess.....At the core this is a good game, the mechanics are fun and enjoyable but with this matchmaking the game is just unplayable. For your own benefit don't play this game unless you play with friends or until they have fixed the matchmaking.
6061	0	a	- Game is exploitable and allows you to win simply because you utilized the dirtiest tricks. The rage when doing this is gold, though. - Matchmaking sucks. Time to take out the stun guns. - Weapon balance sucks. Just use OP weapons all day, every day. Bam. Win streaks. - The servers are so bad, combat looks like a DB:Z fight. - The game will lag no matter how good your PC is. - There's like 100,000 players that play around 2 - 3 days a week, and 15,000 that play over 3 days a week. 1,200 of those are cheating. - You would be better off selling your soul to Satan.
772	1	a	It is very fun, and Free to Play!
1895	1	a	Absolutely addicting! A must have game or at least a must try! If you are into the Grand Theft Auto series or the cops and robbers genre? Then, APB Reloaded will keep you busy for hours on end! Lots to do and complete character customization. Leveling up your gun role progression is what makes this game one of a kind!!!! Very unique and original MMO 3rd person shooting game!   aka Badnuz (Colby)
2770	1	a	A lot of fun, steep steep learning curve as it is mainly focused on non-programmed cover based combat and can lag to an extreme extent.  Pros; -Best customisation I've ever seen in a videogame -A lot of fun once you pass the initial learning curve -Enforcer and Criminal factions are fairly balanced, with Less than Lethal weapons being the only real difference -Ram Raiding/Witnessing crimes and bounties have very fair pay offs -Teamwork really does shine -Premium benefits are well worth the price   Cons; -The learning curve is easily 16 hours of just pure experimentation -The difference between f2p players and Premium players is apparent as the f2p players will be at the disadvantage in both weapons and funds -Expect to pay at least $50 -Terrible AI -Vehicles differ in stickyness and handling -Repetitive missions -Lag will destroy you  Solid 75/100 game. 
3706	1	a	Basically the entirety of this game:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  nwa â¥â¥â¥â¥ the police hq&nbsp;
2283	1	a	good but needs to have some drug smugling like the way GTA chinatown wars did it the game would be superb!! other than that keep it up game DEV.s
7334	0	a	Sure, this game is kinda cool in it's customization aspect but it falls behind in gameplay. This game is 'technically' not pay-to-win, as some would say, but to earn the benefits that paying players get would require countless hours of frustrating attempts to cope with this game.  The gameplay is pretty limited (eg. barely any building are actually accessible) and there are the little things that lower the games value, in my opinion (eg. ladders can only be climbed from the very bottom or the very top; if you are on top of a car next to a ladder, you can't climb the ladder, you must move the car and climb from the bottom.)
9165	1	a	this game is cool and free:)))
3040	1	a	Playing this game til GTA comes almost as good as GTA!
5948	0	a	6 gb of loading screen,bugs and pay2win i coundnt even play the game, i tried 4 times nothing so if you like loading screens this game is for you
7247	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.

6145	0	a	Noob game, so many hackers and they aren't banned, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game -.- Unistalling now
4852	0	a	gets boring, same routine and items. pay to get new items.
6465	0	a	Interesting idea with a nice enough looking world with action packed missions. Actual gameplay is just garbage. Horrible. Cheaters everywhere, unbearable. Not fun at all, die all of time be a hacker *yay!*
6079	0	a	Apb is a good game and fun I put more that 70$ on the game But today apb gave me account block or in other words, banned I never done cheats on the game  I never scam or anything els This week i got 4 permanent guns from joker boxes and now every thing that i put on the game is in the creators money and more that 600 hours  Was nice to play apb alot but im rly  Disappointed from the game...
5486	0	a	this game is the definition of BROKEN, BUGGY AND THE SERVERS... IF ANYONE I MEAN ANYONE calls this game remotely a GTA Clone your are out of your mind this game is a disgrace to F2P games. How can anyone take this game seriously.. The gameplay is beyond terrible, the concept is terrible I mean giving an anarchistic concept on GTA themed clone are you SERIOUS? THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE 0/10
4037	0	a	Game is so unbalanced, you have gold level players playing on bronze servers, hackers everywhere,toxic community who will try and defend this game to the death, whiny people who whisper about reporting you and how they're going to 'hack you' and then block you, enforcers using less than lethal guns that are magical and can stun you in 2 seconds, the market place for this game is also terrible, if you want to pay2win it's expensive, with special guns that cost ~40$ to buy just buy forever on a single charcter, and chances are if you play this game enough you will get banned. Such a terrible game 0/10.
2411	1	a	i havent played alot of this but it seems good but the matchmaking snt fair
834	1	a	I like the game, but not sure about the anti-cheat system.
6955	0	a	APB Reloaded, what can I say. The game is pretty fun and there are alot of options with cars, guns and clothing but it becomes a little bit pay to win. I have 220+ hours on this game and that tells that I have played this game long enough to give my opinion. It is fun with a group of friends, but if you ar going to play it solo it will get boring (if you play it with friends it will also get boring) So sadly I dont reccomend this game even though this game KICKED â¥â¥â¥ back in 2011 when it became free to play (it wasnt free to play before 2011 you had to buy it as a disk and install the game with that) When u bought that u would get some G1C and a free gun for lifetime and some more things.  Theres nothing wrong with the game itself though but it became pay2win which is dissapointing.  Conclusion:  If you have some money to spend and some friends that can also spend some money (about 100$ for the tommygun) thats not the best weapon though but just and example then I would recommend this game, if not search for something else.

9626	0	a	this game sucks
3621	1	a	you will enjoy the game as long as u dont spend real money on it like an idiot so yah spend money on it it sucks but if you dont you will enjoy it
5926	0	a	For a free to play its worth a shot but I did not love it too much.
9805	0	a	A poorly made, terribly designed and boring game is here! DO NOT GET THIS GAME! It's boring is so laggy! Has so many bugs minor problems , terrible voice acting and the worst story! HOW DID THIS EVEN GET ON STEAM! Please do not waste your computer space , time and even money on The package!
10588	1	a	A wide variety of weapons and playstyles/roles to master with a good mix of projectile bullet weapons(assault rifles, smgs, chainguns), clientside hitscan(six shooter high damage pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles), projectile disks, projectile bolts, stickies, mortars and more. Clientside hitscan allows you to play across regions with ease if you wish to play with friends across the globe.
1510	1	a	Much lag much fps drops..... If fps were good it would be 10 but with that its 7
9575	0	a	This has a whole lot of nothing. So much empty space. its just so boring.
2693	1	a	this game is the best but i wonderd what if i riched the last lvl in the whole game  would it be fun?
4333	0	a	this game sucks â¥â¥â¥, get Stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ XIV or Grab That A$$ 50 instead you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fajit
3744	1	a	Pro:  I wouldnt say this is the best game righ now, but this game is amazing. It has a great potential to be the best open mmo open world game ever and rise to the top. It has a crazy customization feature and a smart world system where you can socialize, play with friends, a different server to play against each other or talk in virtual world. Literally nice concepts........   Contra: But yeah, This game needs an anti cheat, fix some issue &amp; glitch, a more fair gameplay and to do a lot of fun stunts, expand the world with more vehicle and AI
7154	0	a	This game is fun and everything but if you win or if you lose is basted on luck. If your team sucks then you suck and your gonna lose but if the other team sucks more then your team sucks then your gonna win so if your team sucks its better to just leave. This game is fun but is a broken peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥ shooter that you can play if you want to but if this game was not free I would not recommend it at all. And btw to start this game is a nightmare the first time. 2/10
9520	0	a	This game is way to complicated to set up. - make a Gamersfirst account - give email and make a password - start game  When I started the game, it took me to a log in screen. It asked for a username (which it didn't have me make) so I thought, 'Maybe I just need to type my steam log in.' and I did that. It didn't work. I went onto the Gamersfirst website to see if they (for some reason) made the username for me. i would then change it to my liking. i get into the fallen Earth profile page and the username is a combo of numbers and letters and dashes. The number of tacks for the password was WAY off to the one I had created.   So unless you know what you are doing, save the headache and don't waste your time trying to download this.  (If I was only making it hard, tellme what I did wrong. Until then, I don't recommend this game)
1131	1	a	This game is not for filthy casuals. It needs a good amont of time to 'git rly gud' at it.
10235	1	a	*SQUAWK*
8617	0	a	This game is a really good game but at the same times... its suck.... , Theres many hacker in this game....,I got ban for no reason... , 4 of my friend get ban for no reason.....and i spent over 400 usd on it and yet i got ban for no reason....i send ticket to gamefirst and they close my case...... :l
4074	0	a	Gotta love it when the game's first mission is to go up against people who have RPG's, sniper rifles, and LMGs.........just don't waste your time.
7048	0	a	After playing this game for 1 year, I can honestly say that I am sick of it. In the beginning, I really enjoyed the game, simply for the fact that it was basically an online version of GTA (open world, stealing pedestrian cars, shooting, third person, etc). The customization in the game was what also kept me drawn to it (also because it is a third person shooter). The amount of detail you can put on your character was like no other F2P game that I have played. Plus you have the ability to create unique custom symbols, themes, songs and car designs. The gameplay is also pretty good. The missions are standard (pick up items, guard items, capture and hold the base/item). It's kinda cool how even though you are in a mission, you are still in the open world and still able to interact with others outside the game (like you don't have to go in a game room and have private matches). But it also gets annoying to deal with grievers and having players run into each other.   Of course with any PVP game, you will have players who are more skilled in the game than others. That's the reason for the player threat level (Bronze, Silver and Gold). There are districts for each of these levels, but of course players choose to play in the lowest district threat as they could (Gold players in Silver district and Silver players in Bronze district). I'm not complaining though because I am just as guilty of this (we all like to feel pro ^^). The weapons in the game however can be unbalanced. Those who choose to purchase G1C have the fortune of obtaining the latest (and most garbage looking reskins remade with some percs) weapons. But that's nothing new. Every game has it's share of P2W.  What I hated most about this game was the community. I haven't played much online games in general, but with the few that I have, it does not compare to the level of displeasure as APB.Of course with any online game, you get your share of trolls, douches and jerks; but this game somewhat gives the advantage to these people (for example: following you around with a car to grieve you, ghost your missions, or sit on top of mission items to purposely make you lose a mission). Not to mention if you are having some luck on a day and do exceptionally well in your matches, you are then insulted and accused of hacking. In opposition to that, if you do poorly you are also ridiculed for playing as an amateur and labelled as a 'noob' or 'scrub'. So no matter how good or bad you are at this game, you will face some form of harassment.  So like I said, I have developed an extreme dislike for this game. Or maybe I've been playing it for too long and finally become sick of it. It's still a fun game, even if it has it's MAJOR flaws.
9977	0	a	I started to download the game when I went to bed and it made my HD make alot of noise and kept waking me up. Then DocTarr said it was crap. So I erased it.
2157	1	a	Great game, and its free to play. I recommend this game for everyone who enjoys playing action games.
10440	1	a	honestly I liked this game more than anything in the form of textures and gameplay so I recommend this game to everyone who wants online and open world games
504	1	a	its a game 
2316	1	a	Nice game. This is in my top 3 list :D
6300	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.
1943	1	a	VERY good customization, anything from clothes to cars to your own EYES can be customized almost infinitely! Gameplay is solid, has very good shooting mechanics and the misson system is just to die for, however the car driving seems to lag for me, (probably my crappy internet), but it is still a very engrossing game, i played 8 hours last night, all in all 9/10, i reduced the score by one since latency issues are a bit to severe even for people with good internet.
3554	1	a	.WiN. I agreed your message......... This was my very favorite A.P.B. - Saints Row game, from then to now. Now, I stopped playing this game. Why, because of hack-cheaters &amp; traiting your team-mates, and extra is they not fixing this game system, just crap they put out. Ignoring us from them G.M. developers not caring about our feelings for a community we were in. -- Sighs -- This game will end to it's very own soul, and gone for goodness sakes when this go in a shut-down in the future, I hope..........
3166	1	a	Its ok but... IT WONT EVER LOAD FOR ME!!!!!! Im still going to give it a thumbs up becuase i only played 1 min of it and i got scared so i accidently shut it down but what i did do in that first minute was fun.
186	1	a	Ballerest game I was a monkey and capped any honkey that stepped and everyone knew they would be capped
9927	1	a	A good Post-apocalyptic game.  Sorta confusing and not knowing what to do at first but you get there.  Haven't spent much time on it but it's a good game.
4830	0	a	It took me 1000 hours to come to my senses....  Don't be like me.... Don't download this...
9906	1	a	Pretty fun, takes a bit longer to level up with spending money, but all in all still a pretty fun game!!!!
9565	0	a	Absolute trash. The mechanics are just... so... wrong. Aiming feels like i'm using a freaking etch-a-sketch. Then looting seems like it freezes the game? I couldn't even finish the tutorial before i felt nauseous. What else can you expect from the creators of APB... Blech.
9316	1	a	I Didnt figure out the system to play, but i think its decent for a f2p!
9964	0	a	i would have to pay someone to play this game 0/21 not worth it being free i tried to play this game but it was confusing and the graphics were terrible like terrible
6557	0	a	This is the worst first person shooter i've ever played. The maps suck, it's way too big and open for only 1 person(me). The servers are never up, and the gameplay is choppy and there isn't even any guns in the game. The weapon choice is absolutely terrible and graphics are bad. Infinity ward and Apple really messed up on this game.
2611	1	a	Very awesome, 1st place in my games list
4735	0	a	I wish I had read the reviews before I actually went into the game a few years back. For the most part, you need a high end desktop to run this. I had found the concept interesting, but now it just runs rampant. The customization is really nice. However, this is NOT new user friendly (I'm an average player). I had no clue what I was doing. Everything seem expensive and confusing.
5547	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.
3454	1	a	This game, although heavy with pay-to-win content, is extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it.
4061	0	a	The only way you could have fun is by paying the micro transactions. All in all, this is pay 2 win.
1739	1	a	I don't know about any of you but I enjoy the game. I haven't found it repetative like others say, but whatever. I would give it 7/10. Just like almost all games, I want to get that one thing and when I finally get it I don't want to play it anymore. So you wait a while and then the game gets fun again.  Describe this game in one word: Co-op
10629	1	a	If your computer can handle it, this game is a joy to behold.
3439	1	a	it is a fun third person but one problem it crash A LOT i can barly play it but it is the first week on steam so....
6853	0	a	Pay to play garbage. I hope you like renting weapons, because that's all you're going to get to do unless you drop real cash. The combat is third person awkward and boreing.
8799	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥
9080	1	a	i reley dont wan to say this, but i have to now. this game is so esey. i mean, all you do is hit the spacebar. thats it! how is this an RPG anyway? you cant contrail anything but what it says on the screen! what if i didnt want to buy the potion? what apout quests? all you can upgrade is stranth? there is no way you can lose to the boss at the end! this game is crap! its not even an RPG at all! i mean look at it! in what way is this supposed to be an RPG if you can do quests and stuff? all you do is press one butten the entier time! explain to me! the athore coments al totol lies! is it supposed to be stick dudes? i dont even know how this damn game got the daily 3rd prize, or a rating of 4.26! pepole think this review is worthles. go ahead! say it! i dont care! im just trying to make a point here! blam this piece of crap!!!!  P.S the only reson im giving this a 1 is beacuase the voices where pretty good. but thats it!
393	1	a	
531	1	a	this game is really good, Very fun to play with friends. 'It's awesome'
8671	0	a	This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential. The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers. I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 300 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.  Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.
707	1	a	Welcome to the world of bumpercar, exploding vehicles, fashion shows, missions and random weirdness. Place yourself in a law-destroyed town as a police or criminal, witness or steal, arrest or escape. It's a jolly mayhem that is, ofcourse filled with smurfs so be careful. weapons are all time-limited so when purchasing remember to commit. cars are forever though. You can make personal tattoos, personal graffitti, personal car decorations and thus this game can consume your spare time to the fullest. much fun, do try it.
1292	1	a	I havent played this game but they lett me write a review for it.
2075	1	a	Rated A for A-holes.
10181	0	a	Didn't care for the early game mechanics.  I feel other games can offer better packages of this theme.
6855	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
8429	0	a	This was a fun game, but the devs don't really care about the players. If you play legitly and get banned, oh well. They won't help you. This game had a lot going for it, but due to the devs and the community, this game is not worth getting, even though it is free to play, which really means free to grind for hours on end for something you can just buy for a few dollars. The trailers also falsely lead you to believe that you can shoot anyone and take on any player at any given moment, which is not true. You have to be in a mission of some sort to have any pvp of any sort, and there is no pve at all.  Verdict: Not worth your time. If you want to play a game like this, Grand Theft Auto V has a better community, a better development team, and overall is just more fun thatn this.
6209	0	a	I have put many hours into this game, and it is extremely fun. However just like Blacklight: Retribution, very pay to win and lots of hackers. I still love this game, however you will probably not.
4638	0	a	It's probably one of the worst games I've ever had the misguided pleasure to play.Terrible community, bad game mechanics, that sort of stuff. But it's strangely addicting the first time around, so you keep playing and playing, even though you know its absolute garbage. I can't explain it really. It's like bad drugs or cigarettes, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ for you but you keep coming back.   Overall: Best game I ever had the pleasure of uninstalling.
2191	1	a	A good free to play game, with one of the best customization options in any game, with an interesting setting, if u wish a gta mp style game, this is it.
2199	1	a	Love the game! Just wish there was less cheaters.
10213	1	a	This game was ok, its a pretty decent MMO, the only downside, is the Enemies, they respawn rather quickly, and if your on a quest to get an object thats surrounded by idk 20 enemy NPC's if your not mega-high level to take them down quick (or if you dont have someone with you like that) youll get through half before they start showing up again, and then youll have to deal with all the new NPC's as well.
5417	0	a	BAD game  bad graphice  i hope any one can see any thing true in this game
297	1	a	Gives cancer faster than smoking
586	1	a	Combat is kinda wonky, but the rest of the game is good.
5994	0	a	I cant open it
5063	0	a	This game sucks first of all i hate games where you have to log in its the gayest thing ever and it sucks. lots of problems when i finshed makeing my character it wounldnet let me join a game so this game sucks hate this waste of space do not download not worth it .
10799	1	a	Great game, have had a lot of awesome times going a bazillion sanecs and capping flags, or just fooling around with shrikes. It's a real shame HiRez gave up on it, but it's still a fun game
9295	1	a	ITS OK 50/50 depends on what your looking for
9529	1	a	Reminds me of Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome
26	1	a	GamersFirst has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up a lot, Punkbuster and Firefight suck, and the game has a knack for being 'Pay 2 win' (It isn't really... really. It isn't.)  But, the game is fun and the customization options are actually amazing. So yes, I recommend playing it.
232	1	a	Get this game
8978	0	a	Typical Free2Play game
5309	0	a	It is a pile of wank........ Stop buying in-game guns if you have already and use the money to buy a p*rnhub subscription, Becuase if you have wasted money on in-game guns those are probably the only t*ts you will see for a long while
2595	1	a	So much P2W, not much fun.
5533	0	a	This game is aids and you shouldn't spend money on it
7067	0	a	This game is incredebly glitchy and has issues around every corner. The game gives you misions to complete and once you have done so it just continues telling you to do it. When I first started it was ok but for the past 3 days I have been getting major game glitches and have not been able to succeed in doing anything the game wants me to because of it. The game also has severe network issues and is continuesly losing connection to servers even though my internet is just fine, quite annoying.
4827	0	a	I played this game for a little bit and was having a blast at first, but i found a lot more things that were very frustrating!!! We will start with the cons because there is alot of them!  Cons-  1. The game has a steep learning curb for new players. That's all I have to say about this because it speaks for itself.  2. The match making system is terrible!!! I went into my first match expecting a fun game but was destroyed by higher ranked players!!  3. Money- MONEY IS HARD TO GET!!!! as an enforcer you are at disadvantage when you try to make money because missions are your primary source of money the only good money you get is if you win a match. Criminals have it easier when trying to make money because they can raid stores, take stuff and sell it for small amounts of cash but its not much and if you want to buy good stuff you have to do this for hours which can be boring after a while. Money is essential in this game to get new stuff as it is in every game, but this game requires you to have a lot of money to buy stuff and you get money at a really slow rate.  4. Pay to win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my least favorite thing in any game because it causes balancing issues and deter's new players from wanting to play. I got so frustrated when I would put a full mag into a enemy player and he doesn't die then he turns around and fire 2 shots and I am dead!! This would be the thing the got to me the most and is what made me quit playing.  5. The community- Not all the players on this game are bad some were very helpful in situations when I didn't know what to do. A lot of people were very negative and said racist thing they would also threaten each other in the district chat. My team would get mad and start to cuss each other out alot which distracted me from the game and lowered my i.q.   Pros-  1. The clothing market! I was always excited to go to the social district and see how everybody designed their clothes because no one looked the same and the thing people could do with their designs baffled me! I was able to buy a few clothes and look completely different than anyone else and that made my character feel unique.  2. And finally the character creation- I loved this feature becuase they put alot of time to making sure that you look different than any other player in the game. There were tons of small features to choose from the nose bridge and the eye brow width just to name a few examples. Though there could have been more hair styles to choose from I was fine with the few I had available.  I would not recommend this game becuase there are a lot of issues with the game and it doesn't feel like they finnished the game. If i had to score the game i would give it a 3.5/10.  Thanks for reading my review! :)
1020	1	a	Jumped off a building and went through the ground and got banned for 'Exploiting'. 9000/9001
5937	0	a	P2W with players with COD-like shotgunmachinegunsnipers running around fragging people that just installed the game.  Review: -13/10 burgah boy cheese burp snacks
7545	0	a	a nice game, really indepth char customization. sadly it gets boring really quick. as it is just -&gt;get money-&gt;launder-&gt;buy some of the limited items of ingame currency -&gt; do again  you also get spammed in the face every 10 minutes with BUY PREMIUM GET THIS AND THAT  Physics are also just complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. also is car steering  but with some friends on skype you can defenitely have some fun in here.
2973	1	a	Amazing game, defenately worth a try. However, preapare to grind a little for good items.
9218	1	a	After wandering the wasteland of Fallen Earth for more than 200 hours, thought it was time to give my opinon. There is a staggering amount of quests, mutant creatures, and crafting. Being this is such an awsome free mmo, I would rate this a 9/10. This game has been around for years now, and still has alot of people coming back for more. The graphic are smooth and realistic. A variety of sound, grapic, and other setting options. The help chat is one of the best I have ever seen! Hard not to get a help queston answered by more than one player. The ability to ride horses, atv's, and sweet cars across a very large map makes me want to get 3D headset. If there were air and water craft, I would probably never want to stop gaming!?.
8967	0	a	this game is VERY incomplete. the game needs more sound theres hardly any and this makes for an underwhelming game, i also think that the controls are a bit much and also very odd (i.e Y being the action/interact button). However for the most part the character design was pretty awesome and the only thing i think they should do to it is add a few more clothing options.
2902	1	a	Fun game but when it comes to specs this things just loves to hog your computers power. It really needs to be optimized more and always have lag issues. That being said, it is a fun game espically if your a robber.
5312	0	a	1/10 would never play again
5885	0	a	It crashes every time i press start. This game need fix.
594	1	a	its fun if you pay like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of money! 
6463	0	a	This game isn't really new-user friendly. It handles much like GTA, but guns are unlocked based on your level, and you have to kill people do gain levels. They basically start you out with a stick and everyone else has rocket launchers. It's more fun to play with a friend, especially if you're just starting. Friends are more likely to put up with your learning curve than the community would.
6943	0	a	For me, I was really excited about this game when I first saw it. It looked like a fun cops and robbers kind of game. When I got in, I realized that there was a good amount of customization available, which is always nice. I even set up some playlists to blast in my car. However, that's about as good as it will get. The gameplay is somewhat odd because everything feels kind of bland. There isn't too much to do in the world unless you are playing with friends. There are some missions that just feel really weird too. I didn't enjoy the controls much either. The community is alright, I guess. It's just not much that is offered in this game, but I guess that's kind of a regular thing for free-to-play games.
2898	1	a	Awesome, high quality &amp; freedom. Those 3 titles speak for themselves.
8689	0	a	Was a great game and all, but some of even the most top players recently and FINALLY got caught in a major banwave for hacking.  No longer worth playing when respected members of the community are caught aimbotting after years of doing it.
10299	0	a	Boring, alot of walking, cool ideas but it's not what I'm looking for in a game.
2766	1	a	uuuuh I played dis game, I think it was about the old childhood classic 'Cops and Robbers'
3531	1	a	Okay this is a reliably good game that will keep you going for lots of time AND ITS FREE get now 11/10
9248	0	a	I had more fun installing the game than playing it.
10176	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
1108	1	a	APB is a very fun to play game, you don't need to pay for anything to have loads of fun. Some features of the game include Cops and Robbers, Ram Raiding (by far the best), and freeroam. There is DLC to buy but i don't use it mainly because i don't want to buy it. This is my opinion of the game, and i hope you like it. Enjoy those RamRaids!!!
2652	1	a	Thisis Osam
7419	0	a	No.i refuse to waste my time talking about this game.now go away and pirate a copy of another open-world game
1875	1	a	Really love the game. :)) 10/10 :))
10680	1	a	Excellent CTF game with increcible speed :).
4148	0	a	Do i recommend this game to other players? no. why?  1.Match Making system is bad (Example: a player played the game for 50 hours can matched with a player who played 800 hours.  Another example if this game is like League of Legends, they are making bornze fight platinum or gold fights diamond)  2.hackers (Some top rank players can be hacker)  *3.They want money ( what i mean is that fix the game is not their primary, they made more things to buy and try to attract more players)  4.Bad performance(Server like waterfount is not stable, ping jumps from 50 to 500)  But if you want to know the good side of this game, here is what i found.  1.customize ( custom your clothes , your car , your music , or the troll music that the player gonna hear it after you kill them.)  2.you are playing with 100 people ( The idea of have a free world and your battles can be any where in the map is great and the missions can get effect by other players that have nothing to do with you is interesting, it makes you feel you are playing a lots of people not just a server with 10 people in it)  3.Freedom( There is more other then just doing missions,  you can play fight club if you don't feel like to finish a whole match, that you can quit any time you want and you will still get rewarded.  Or you just don't feel like you want to fight, you can just drive in the free world or you can go to social district talk to other people, looks at other people custom maybe get some new idea and use on your own, trade, make your self look more badass or cute, make some music etc)  4.Is a mixed game , it can cover a lot( Is a shooter game but is also a driving game, it can even be strategy game or a rpg, it have skills on character , guns , and cars . It have a lot to explore)  And that is the good side and the bad side of this the game. I would say if you do not have the patience then this game is not for you, the good stuff doesn't come if you can't pass it's dark side first . However if you have patience and are interest what it have to offer to you, you can try but no guaranteed you will get what you want.
7939	0	a	very laggy, TONS OF INPUT LAGG, and crashes a ton -1/10
1950	1	a	Love the limitless customization. But the community is not really good due idling the newbie. No pay to win, In-game weapon still can killng the enemy. But the only problem is when the higher rank player get a better gear and shooting you all time.
3186	1	a	This game is legit! i've had so much fun playing it! and its addicting to play 
10770	1	a	Tribes: Ascend is probably the only online FPS I've actually enjoyed playing, no other game has you capping the flag at 260km/h screaming WOOHOO WOOHOO as enemies try to shoot you out of the sky with lasers and â¥â¥â¥â¥. The skiing mechanic is so much fun and jeypacks are just icing on the cake. Every class offers a completely different style of play. It's so much fun and I'd recommend it to anyone. Not to mention that it's also free and it's not ppay to win since anything you can get with real money can also be obtained through play.   hey, psst, use this  https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥=960306&amp;utm_campaign=email 
5021	0	a	Lags too much and you get faced with unfair opponents who out rank you by a mile.
8090	0	a	?
1278	1	a	Even tho on steam it says i have a little over 100 hours, i have around 700 hours total downloaded through GamersFirst. I love this game for its uniqueness but it isnt for everyone. If you enjoy getting matched with opponents that are either way better than you or way worse than you then you will like it. I recommend it because its worth a try and its free to play so why not? Just give it a chance!
702	1	a	If you want a free GTA Online then this is as close as you're gonna get! It is a really fun game and you may aswell try it because it is free! 9/10
9500	1	a	Never played this game steam says i have so....  Roasted pumpkin soup recipe  â¢ 1.5kg edible pumpkin â¢ Olive oil â¢ 1 teaspoon dried chilli â¢ 1 tablespoon coriander seeds â¢ 1 large onion â¢ 3 cloves garlic â¢ 1 carrot â¢ 1 stick of celery â¢ 1 litre hot vegetable stock  Preheat the oven to 170Â°C/340Â°F. Half the pumpkin and remove the seeds (you can keep these for roasting), then chop into wedges. Place the pumpkin on two large baking trays and drizzle over a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar, grind the chilli and coriander seeds with a pinch of salt until finely ground. Sprinkle the spices over the pumpkin with some black pepper. Roast the pumpkin for 1 hour, or until soft and slightly caramalised at the edges.  Meanwhile, roughly chop the onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Heat a lug of olive oil over a medium heat in a large saucepan then add the vegetables and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet but not coloured.  When the squash is ready, add to the pan with the hot stock. Blend with a stick blender, adding a little more water if you like a thinner consistency. 
6849	0	a	Pay to win. Imbalanced. Full of hackers and bad attitudes.  Could be fun with private matchmaking where you can choose who you play, but it isn't fun at all.
10631	1	a	Prepare for halo type fighting while skiing
4939	0	a	APB Reloaded. This game. I can't really think of a place to begin. This game is awful. Flat out pay-to-win noob destroying, mindlessly violent game. I was pretty enticed by the opening art. That is literally it. When I was put out into the world I was put up against unbalanced pros that absolutley destroyed the learning curve. This game is 100% pvp. No middle ground to get a feel for the game. And no legit training area. The training area is pvp. And of course can be invaded by pay-to-wins. This destroys the game. The story behind this game just seems more like an excuse for this game to exist than an actual game. The graphics are sub-par. Not bad but not great. The only thing that this game has going for it, is the over the top customization. I've always been a sucker for customization so that is how I discovered this little crapper. It also doesn't help that a good portion of customizations can either be aquired through hundreds of hours of devotion, or money. I know this is a F2P and thats to be expected but I cannot stand pay-to-win games. Especially if your game is nothing but pvp! What kind of horsecrap is that!? What were they thinking?? They did nothing to balance this garbage at all. They just give you a junk rifle and put you up against the pros during the tutuorial and wish you the best of luck. And the gunplay itself is dominated by snipers. As a game I give it 22/100
3205	1	a	Very well made game and also can be extremely addictive,there will be a little lag now and then but its acceptable and not to bad
2100	1	a	THE GOOD GAME
10458	0	a	Encouraged by friend to try it out I installed Fallen Earth and I was prepared for some fun. Sure, this game is kind of fun - there is so much to do, plenty of quest, etc. but for some reason it didn't made me stay for longer than few hours. Maybe it's because I prefer MMO games in fantasy setting than post apocalyptic. Maybe one day I will be back and give it another chance but for now I say nope. It's free to play game so go ahead and try it yourself, maybe you spend more time playing Fallen Earth than I did.
3463	1	a	Been playing this for a few weeks now, enjoying the GTA like game in a mmo style, try it :)
3878	0	a	APB Reloaded is fun for the first few days. After a while it gets repetitive with only 3 maps or called ' Districts ' in the game, Financial, Waterfront and Social. The driving mechanics is rather delayed and takes time to get use to. Customization is very diverse where you can make your own symbols that you can either put on your body as a tattoo, cars, and clothing. Gameplay is unbalanced and seems Pay2win. AI citizens are repasted around the districts and are dumb at sometimes. The two factions are the Enforcers and the Criminals, each faction have their own cars and contacts. Contacts don't have much peronality as they're just mindless AI characters with repetitive dialouge. Gun markets seem cheap, you can only buy them for a limited time for ingame currency. I give this game a 6/10.
9767	0	a	Best game ever. Its like Sims character editor with less features, wont even load the world after you made your character and all...

7310	0	a	Update fails 100% of the time with a 'Disk write error' Can someone please help me with this?
10645	1	a	Fast paced action, great game!
8046	0	a	I dont know what to say... Its not a good game
8672	0	a	Well, the game is an good Game. BUT. There are many hackers in the game and seriously, this game is pay2win.  I payed more than 50â¬ and much work in it to trade my legendaries in this game. And i got banned from GamersFirst.  GamersFirst Support is just poor. They answer very quick, but never give you the best solution.  There are many overpowered weapons that never get patched. Thats the only thing that destroys the Game.  Im still playing the game, i enjoy it. Tho if it is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.  I dont know why, but i just like it.  But this game, is Pay2Win and upâ¥â¥â¥â¥.  Dont play this Game if you dont like: Pay2Win, Hackers, Scammers, a poor Support, and reasonless Bans.
6267	0	a	too boring
11	1	a	Best way to teach yourself humility.  10/10
9084	0	a	Since this game is available on steam, you'd think you wouldn't have to set up another account with some other game site to play this.
193	1	a	It's pretty fun to play with friends for a little bit and then it often gets really boring. 7/10
3915	0	a	I left this morning to work only to be involved in a car accident ' not at fault' , I was rushed to the hospital and after exhausting day they found nothing wrong with me , except bruises and sores. I took a cab home,, unfortunately the taxi was rear ended, they took me back to the same hospital , the staff wasnt helpful, they laughed their â¥â¥â¥ off at my misery and that's not all, I now have a wrist fracture thanks to the medical staff for slamming the gurney into the wall,, and to all that. I still would rather experience this day then to play APB Reloaded again, this game is just awful.
7178	0	a	This game is not even loading i said BULLSH*T and start smashing my keybored
719	1	a	+  Open world sandbox (Medium areas); Drivable vehicles; Custom clothes and cars Various weapons to use;   -  Poor optimization; A few modes to play, it feels repetitive. (Youget bored quickly.); The world doesn't feel alive, the people are souless; Only 2 main maps to play and 1 to custumize your character.  Score: 6/10.
7294	0	a	Infuriating game. It can actually be great fun, especially with friends. But not only is APB severely crippled by stupid game design, the engine is atrocious. Expect ridiculous lag making the game unplayable, crashes to desktop or even crashes that lock up your entire system. Support for this game seems nonexistent too - these problems have been going on for years now.
2149	1	a	If you like game such as gta well this is the game for you , you can be cops or the criminals insanely fun however its a bit of pay to win but if your looking for a bit of fun this is for you.
10653	1	a	rip 0nyxheart
3781	0	a	Wow, I cannot begin to fathom how a game with such a great concept can get it so wrong in every way. Who doesn't want to be on either side of the law, battling the other side in a fast paced action game? No matter how hard you try to like this game, it will push you back with poor performance, game breaking bugs, repetitive and uninteresting missions and extremely unbalanced matches. If you are not planning to put money into this game, do not bother wasting your Hard Drive space and time with this game. This is the most pay2win game I have seen in a long time. And, speaking of money, the prices of the items are insane, with $5 getting you 400GC. If you want to buy a vehicle to keep, while on special, it is 3000GC. Think about that.  This game is probably one of the worst executed games I have ever seen. If you are prepared to fork out a fair sum of money, and put up with laggy servers and a plentiful amount of hackers, your crazy. If you still proceed to download and play this game, you must enjoy self-harm.  Avoid this game AT ALL COSTS
8786	0	a	Would have recco'd but takes for ever to update Engine scene is dead. VVGT
8002	0	a	doesnt even launch just takes you to a facebook page   EDIT: managed to get past the facebook page issue it launched closed itself out after about a minute then locked up my steam and i cant get rid of it i have no options but to restart my computer to be able to play any real games and delete this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ so in end if you want to break steam download this game and have fun breaking steam i sure as hell didnt
4794	0	a	What a crock of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1667	1	a	If you consider paying for a cosmetic change that you could do anyway without paying P2W, then this would be P2W. That is not, however, what P2W actually is, and if you consider games that need money to survive as being P2W then you are a truly sad individual and will likely end up poor and alone.
591	1	a	An Awesome Game!! XD This game is just like GTA 5 basically, but just less features thats all. No lag in all servers that i have played. Really fun game when u play with friends
8095	0	a	It not good because if you like starting out you and when you in a fight the team is overpower if you want to get better it like $50 to buy to get what you want the other game Fallen earth is a lot better than this game and you buit and pvp as long as you want
7513	0	a	I wish it was good, but it isn't. Cash shop driven, not enough content, cheaters EVERYWHERE. The theory is good, execution bad, and this will never change as developer is underpowered to fix it.
9027	1	a	This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some 'new' things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.  Now to the problems The enemy AI tends to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.   Over all this game has +Great gameplay mechanics +Interesting storys and characters +Great immersion +Addictive micro managing +Great trade and communication system  The middle ground Game lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem and is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.  Now the bad  -Terrible AI -Unhelpful NPC's -Strange level system -Fast enemy respawns  Overall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 
7968	0	a	Game given to us from the heavens includes: The game not working correctly Bugs Runs in background AND MANY MORE Game Of The Year 2015 11/10 Would Uninstall Again!
5028	0	a	It's like TF2: New players are noobs. If you're not P2P you're a noob - you are a F2P 'scrub'. Weapons are too OP, and fanbase is a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. GG
8391	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
2445	1	a	Wasn't expecting this game to be so enjoyable
4857	0	a	Good for the money (nothing) but it gets rather boring very quickly.  The game doesn't hold much for people not playing with friends, since it's either hard to communicate or you get stuck with a pack of people who don't know what they're doing.  Aside from that, premiums get very big advantages, including one shot weapons, which sort of removes the 'free to play' element.  If you've played everything else, and you want something for you and your friends, get it -- if there's something else, don't.
2499	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
4137	0	a	The balancing in this game is non-existent. If you buy an armas weapon (Armas martketplace is the microtransations thing from gamersfirst (Gamersfirst is completeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, more like moneysfirst)) then you will reak havoc. Whisper, joker cr5, and any other armas weapon against you will make you want to kill yourself. Good luck.
8802	0	a	TL:DR - You must be a masochist to take this game seriously.  Still a terrible shooter. Somewhat fun for the veterans, just the new pay2win guns make it hard to be enjoyable. Not to mention the hackers. There's an average of one or two per team on Fight Club, at weekends. Don't know about the action districts as I hardly play them, but it's safe to assume they are there as well. It's a game adored by hackers for some reason. G1 should legalize wallhack and everything to level the field.  Grind is less terrible than most F2P games, kinda of goes fast if you are dedicated. But it's hard to raise credits to buy anything, since the payouts for missions or the fight club are next to abysmal. Obviously there to help selling premium subscriptions/premium stuff.  To summarize, you must be a masochist to install this game and keep it, to take it seriously. Believe me, I was one of those maschists that wanted to have everything the game could offer back in 2011.   You may have one or two fun matches, then it's a neverending streak of awful matches that'll probably end up with a broken mouse or worse in a fit of rage. There isn't a friend I met in the game who doesn't have one of those nerd rage stories.
7396	0	a	I absolutely hated this game. I was put up against players that were way ahead of me right when i started. How am i supposed to progress through the game if i can't even get a kill? Fix that issue and maybe i'll decide to play it again, but in the meantime, don't expect me to play this game at all.
8357	0	a	do not go near this game, hackers the likes of which makes WoW looks safe. Pay to win doesnt even cut it, its literally pay to play. if you dont spend large amounts of $$ you will not be able to do anything as every aspect of this game is tailored to making non paying players (even those who originally paid for the game) heavily inferior to those whom are willing to pay.
5881	0	a	This game honestly seems unplayable to me. I'm sure its a good game, but I can't see for myself because when I go to register theres a little sign/symbol thing in front of what I think is the next step button. I can't even get past the first step because of this. Theres no guides or oher people having this problem. I can't scroll, I can't move the box, just completely stuck. 0/10.
1431	1	a	It's not perfect.
8043	0	a	if you like tutorials that take 3 hours you will love this game
6087	0	a	APB Realoaded...okay here have a look at this first: The Pros -Character customazation i guess? Well its pretty good. -You Get to choose what faction you want to be. Well that's a pretty good add since most games are like 'OH HEY UR A GUD GUY WIT SUCKISH CLOTHS!' -Cars. Yeah that's awesome. Annddd...That's it. The Cons -Pay To Win. Yeah we all died from a person with an OP gun in this game, because wasting money on a free game is a good idea. -No new game modes. -The Fact you have to have a monster PC to run this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Hey i managed to run Far Cry 3 and Payday 2 before why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ does this lag so much?  -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community. Wow everywhere i go someone is like 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you im better then you' i tried asking help to get started and the awnser is 'Learn that yourself you dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥'.   4/10 Dont waste your time and Computer Space on this â¥â¥â¥â¥.

9756	1	a	Top notch old school MMO. Very detailed, and somewhat complicated. Definately not dumbed down like some of the newer games. This one has been around awhile, but is still well worth playing. The fighting is done in more of a FPS type. Heavy crafting, almost everything in the game can be crafted. It's set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, and you have mounts like motorcycles and cars. It can be time consuming, but is an excellent game and I recommend it to everyone. It can be truly played for free and has a good payment model.
2874	1	a	It's kinda like a free GTA. But with teamwork and a MMORPG style.
1222	1	a	I like the game its mostly like GTA so i think you sould get it.
1192	1	a	GTA/ Saints Row type of game. Animations should be a bit more stable, but good for i free game!
6486	0	a	no start why??
5838	0	a	I have played a long while without steam since close Beta, all G1 gamers are friendly and F2P.   Till 2013, P2W became hot topic in this game and i totally AGREE those people who invest a lot of MONEY in this game can have HIGH CHANCE TO WIN,  That trigged gamers (most of them are UNMATURE KIDS) tried to use with HACK PROGRAMMES for tricking G1 points and gaming that happened on 3 servers(EU, NA, HK). [Check youtube please, Gamerfirst]  The threat system became a joke for me. FAKE GOLD, HACKER CLAN.  I believe people will change, and game as well,  but it have become worst than what gamers should EXPERIENCE( ENJOYMENT, EXCITMENT and TEAMWORK).  Im sick of the communty with hackers and team killers.  Please someone help this game.
10497	1	a	Tribes, the definition of what I want to see in a game. The unique mechanics in this game are so original and flawless that it makes me weep for everyone who think each new call of duty is revolutionizing the FPS genre, or nearly any shooter for that matter. With tribes you need true skill to do almost anything in this beautiful game unlike some other shooters I know where spray and pray is just the norm. While that could mean a bit of a steep learning curve I guarantee you that your time will not be wasted learning this game, and you will surely understand from this from the brilliant 'cha-ching' of your very first blueplate. This game is also very pretty if you can run it on the higher settings (unlike me) and the sense of speed as you fly through the terrain is unreal. Sadly though as I wright this review the developer, Hi-Rez, have completely dropped this game from their radar. It is no longer being looked after and the community is very small which is a shame with how magnificent this game is. Even though there is no campaign, no developer oversight, and hardly any people playing it this still remains to this day my #1 favorite game simply because of how perfect the core gameplay experience is and how unique this game is among the vast array of shooter that, to be honest, all feel exactly the same. Hopefully in the future there will be another addition to the tribes series and I sincerely hope that Hi-Rez will do it great justice and now that the company is out of its infancy will understand how to keep a game thriving. This game deserves so much more credit then it recieves, even if it recieved some form of GOTY award, it deserves even more attention. It saddens me that good games like this get shoved to the side and forgotten while every 'new' COD gets so much attention even when it is doing the same thing over and over. What makes me most sad though is to anyone who would pick up this game today would not understand the impact this game had to some people in its prime, all they would see is hundreds of empty servers with what seems like 50 people online at any one time. Even though this game has admittedly gone downhill it will still remain as my favorite game of all time.
10160	0	a	Not my cup of tea.
4041	0	a	If you like rocketlauncher battle world, you will like it. If you don't, then don't download this game. It's just a pay 2 win with brainless kids.
5140	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks â¥â¥â¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.
5666	0	a	Fun game, but it gets boring after a while and it is pay to win.
119	1	a	!!!!!
10168	1	a	Really Interesting Game, If You And Your Friends Like Kinda Sorta End Of The World Stuff Then You Will Like This Game. Although It Cannot Fully Capture The, 'End Of The World' Feel, Being An MMO And All.
6764	0	a	Game becomes a trollfest regardless of which side you pick. Can be fun. Everything just devolves into trolling. That's if the game works. If it does, try not to go over 60mph considering the massive lags spikes which hilarisouly throw everyone on server into walls every five to ten minutes.  Like I said though, game can be fun.  Be warned: there are many, many people playing together as cops and robbers 'boosting'.
660	1	a	This game is sooo like gta 5 and the graphics are good and theres all different guns 2 choose :) 
2666	1	a	this game is really fun to play plus its free!
652	1	a	Large skill gap, a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ players, but so worth it once you're used to it.
1034	1	a	The game was fun and addicting for a bit. Games were pretty competitive except matchmaking wasn't too fair.
2803	1	a	a lot of lag, but a great game~
3530	1	a	If you combined the way preschooler's view cops and robbers with the worst cops and robbers action movie in the world, this is basically what you'd get. Somehow, the game is still enjoyable...mostly.  10/10 would be the best bikini cop again
5546	0	a	Words cnat even describe how pay to win this is, but I can try.  First off it is important to note that the 'tutorial' the game gives you is little mpore than some stuff that you need to do, but it doesnt really say how and while you do it, your not in a seperate part of the game like most mmo's, no you are in the game, with no clue what to do.   Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.  Honestly, when i got this game, i saw the bad reviews and thought 'Whatver, this game looks awesoeme!', and even though i started with no expectations, somehow, this bundle of steaming horse crap has gone below my lowest expectations. Do not play this game, please, just trust me.  Overall -10/10
933	1	a	GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game. Just jump in and play.  Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Replayability 14/15 Gameplay 12/15  Overall - 9/10

3020	1	a	SO MUCH FUN :D  This game may be a pay-to-win but just avoid the few players that pay to win and you will have a great time with mates. The more people you have working together the more entertaing it is ^_^
7793	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
8465	0	a	Had fun for many hours, until I realized that I kept on getting beaten by lvl 1's because they decided to be P2W and buy rocket launchers and all kinds of crazy â¥â¥â¥â¥.  This game is 80% P2W, and 20% actual fairness.
2948	1	a	wow, i have not played anything so bad in my life.. soooooo not coool. terrible physics
1428	1	a	I've played this game for a long time, it has been great watching it grow, weather good or bad, The dev's of this game are very hardworking and in general sweg dudes. They have particularly worked on fixing the pay to win system, they don't care about money. Overall i would rate this a 7/10, its good when you start but after 500 hours it gets repetitive
23	1	a	I did not spend that much time.   (Update) I have now realized this game has been causing me a great amount of stress. This game is exactly why my wooden chair i would sit in won't stand on its legs anymore.
4010	0	a	 If you enjoy grinding consistently for months/years and forking out Hundreds to Thousands of dollars a year for a premium membership and/or Pay2Win weapons, then this game was made specifically for YOU.
2219	1	a	Good game guys. Play tutorial, finish your task and get ready for action.  Note: If Punkbuster kick your â¥â¥â¥, go here and download:  http://www.punkbuster.com/index.php?page=pbsetup.php   Then find APB Reloaded and update it (with Punkbuster).
2419	1	a	Very fun game with cars of your own! I recromend it to all my friends who like to customize their cars and add parts to it!
5319	0	a	the game sucks. it says i played for 1.4 hours. the 1.3 hours was spent creating profiles and installing. i thought the whole idea of steam was to centralize online games for computer gamers?  anyway, i played for 5 minuted and then deleted it.
9968	0	a	Everyone who has played this game and said it was good obviously doesn't know what Fallout is...
5006	0	a	Lagging Servers / crashing lobbys / payed weapons are much better then regular ones / ridiculous pricing! (one weapon lifetime 60 bucks lol) alsmost forgot something.. i wrote them ones.. they never replied. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you GamerFist
861	1	a	Great..
10103	1	a	yess i like it a little bit but how do u go into 3rd person? 
9929	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...

246	1	a	This is still one of my favorit games on my Steam library and it is full of fun things to do (aside from the lag). you can customize allmost anything in the game and there is a large amount of guns and cars to use in game. Also there is a back story to the game (no one really reads anyways :/) but I have and it is not that bad, I say this game is a must get for the roll playing shooter type of people that like to customize alot.
6968	0	a	&gt;downloaded the game &gt;sat through ten minutes of cutscenes &gt;creaded a character &gt;tried to join a server &gt;game crashed &gt;restarted &gt;it said 'graphics card not good enough' &gt; Looked at my graphics card &gt;realized it was 4 times as powerful as the recommended &gt;tried to uninstall &gt;failed to unistall &gt;steam thinks that im still in game    you know a game is bad when you cant unistall it.
27	1	a	If you wan't:  - Cheaters; Blatant &amp; Closet Alike -  GM's 24/7 Around The World!  No GM's monitoring the playerbase... - Inconsistent game mechanics due to the game's direction... - Lag - Ponies - Unstable Servers  APB:R is the game for you!  -9/7 *
1144	1	a	Extremely underrated game!  Pros: Extreme customisation system Gameplay simmilar to that of Grand Theft Auto V Good enough graphics  Cons: MICROTRANSACTIONS.
6662	0	a	Was like throwing pickels into a pool urine!
9554	0	a	I played this a while back and at first the game seemed pretty interesting, but then I tryed to get an ATV. (I understand this may not have been the best goal ever right at the start of the game.) Anyway, I didn't appreciate the abnoxiously large expanses of nothing. My friends and I were roaming along for a few hours, trying to get to the very distant places to finish the quests to get ATVs. The questline to get the ATVs was rediculously long and it also felt like you had to pay for stuff in order to get anything good. I don't know how it is now, but I don't particularly recommend this game due to the miles of annoyingly empty expanse that I had to traverse.  P.S. I'm sure this is a great game for those who enjoy MMORPs, please make sure to read other reviews. (I'm not a huge MMORPg player, therefore I did not get very far in the game. I also had a bad experience with my friends running off and stuff.)

10358	1	a	Class post apocolyptic game.
8386	0	a	I do not recommend this game unless they remove all but cosmetic items from the cash shop.
3410	1	a	Get ready to get rustled.
1788	1	a	GTA mixed into a mmo, its a fun game to play with alot of other people, there is some down sides, they could use more maps after a while it gets little boring with only 2 maps... but the upside is if you feel like running over people shooting everyting and even blowing up cars, chasing cops or cops chasing chrims this is a great mmo ITs FTP so no money will really need to be spent unless you want to!
7602	0	a	Pretty close to â¥â¥â¥â¥!
5927	0	a	Boring. Sharp learning curve.
5149	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
10304	1	a	fallen earth is an impressive game as the graphics are aesthetically pleasing and the amount of in game items (trinkets weapons armor etc.) is immense. however the game is hindered by having very few non-pvp areas.
433	1	a	I found out about this game through my 'random links' method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled 'A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions'         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions&nbsp;
8359	0	a	The worst tutorial
5962	0	a	APB... a P2W game where losers who don't have any skill in games gather to buy weapons that give them advantage so that they can feel a little bit better about themself when they destroy someone with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pistol/smg in few hits... that about sums it all up i guess, nothing else needs to be said about this game besides it not being worth your time, don't worther downloading it because you will be disappointed very quickly and you will regret ever being born into a world where this game exists, id rather watch my windows update itself rather than play this game.
139	1	a	nice gameplay
3356	1	a	;)
2170	1	a	To be honest, this game is familiar to Saints Row. The game is good, but could use some improvements. Playing with friends is fun though :)  7/10
2001	1	a	This is one of the best games i have been playing. Long nights with a lot of rage. This game is definitivly somthing for yea
1959	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.

689	1	a	best played with friends :D
5521	0	a	If you have 2GB RAM and a graphics card below 9400 GT generation then this game wont start
2070	1	a	So, here you are. You're debating whether or not to press that sweet, sweet play now button. What could be the harm? I mean, you've heard it has a great customization system. It looks a little like GTA, and since you're too poor (or cheap) to pay for the actual game, you've come to the free version of it.  Well, as all free things come with, this game will have its downsides.  'Good' Things: - Awesome customization - Physics=non-existent - Be half naked and you still have the same amount of health as a kickass SWAT team member - Did I mention walking through the social district is essentially the same as watching porn? - Car customization too.  Bad things. Really, really bad things: - Pay to win. People will deny that it's true, but it is. Some guns can take you down in a simple two hits. Some guns can take out a car in one hit. - The presets for their character creation are TERRIBLE. It looks like you just rose from the grave to kill someone if you choose the female model (like me). - So I heard you liked cars? Well, be prepared to grind endlessly through missions to get the money and 'Joker tickets' to buy them. -Matchmaking is terrible. You may be a bronze rank (ranking being from bronze, to silver, to gold with gold being the highest) and be paired up with a full squad of golds.  - You CAN'T LEAVE A MATCH WITHOUT QUITTING THE ENTIRE GAME. - If you randomly get rocketed to gold rank like I did, when you can't kill people for â¥â¥â¥â¥ and are just playing to customize, guess what? No more going onto lower ranking servers, because obviously everyone who gets gold rank is MLG af. - 10 year olds.  10/9 would play for the rest of my days for clothing.

All I really did was die and then got bored.

10031	1	a	Its a really awesome underated game..wish more people enjoyed it :l
2805	1	a	this game is for sure one of the best games ive played i would recommend it to people who like mmorpg games and people who likes action games and free roming without doing missions it has great quality and the sound is perfect the only problem i have is i wish there were more districts.
4619	0	a	Usually I don't downvote on a game concept like this, but the gameplay APB:Reloaded offers is completely awful. Gunplay is terrible, you need to spend real money in order to keep the weapon forever, players equipped with a pistol can kill you in 2 shots, but it takes 20-30 shots to kill them with an assault rifle, (this is close combat), overall for gunplay...it's just...clunky and static. Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower. Completely it's a pay-to-look cool/win, mixed with bad game mechanics.   I like the game concept, but the ways done in the game...are just laggy and boring after a while.
10243	0	a	During my short time with Fallen Earth, I don't think there was a moment where I wasn't bored. One way of putting it is 'the game has a steep learning curve', but in reality that just means it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and convoluted mechanics elsewhere. Bad, even for an MMO.
2674	1	a	yes, this game looks really like gta. but its getting boring after a while! but you should get this game  its really cool
2432	1	a	If you wanna have fun in an open world game this is what you want!
1166	1	a	Hands down, my favorite MMO. Tons of action, great customization abilities, awesome gameplay. And yes, it may be rampant with hackers, but it's still tons of fun to play

1167	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
7705	0	a	A typical G1 owned game, full of hackers. Just like Warrock they get a game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ it over just getting the quick cash. They dont care about the players and made it a pay to win game. Having played the old APB this just sucks. Don't waste your time on this game.

3473	1	a	Good sides: 1) Customization! You can make own death-themes (5 seconds) in a cool midi-editor, you can draw almost any symbol (and put it on any part of clothes, cars). 2) Community. Someone may say that it's all about cheaters, de-threaters or just morons (which always try to ruin your game), but you just should know that quite nice people still exist and you can make new friends just by playing good or making cool stuff (do you remember? - customization!!). 3) Not the worst physics.  Now why I wouldn't recommend this game: 1) Lags. Game really lags even on the newest top PC. Also servers have big tickrate (server-side fps). Sometimes it crashes. 2) Cheaters. Even when FairFight was introduced, cheaters are still a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. But you always can change the district or simply 'do not care'. Or play with friends and make a cheater ragequit! 3) Engine upgrade will never happen (sadly, the game should had been updated 5 or 6 times before I wrote this review, but it has never happened...).
8410	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worst game i ever seen i donwlod it and then go in and uninstal this â¥â¥â¥â¥king â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t ! nobody wants this game because they are make free to play bucause this is â¥â¥â¥â¥! dont dowload it! plz remove from steam this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
10298	0	a	The game 'Fallen Earth' is but a sorry excuse for a free-to-play game. This game- not being worth the memory needed to download it - would be better off unplayed and unexplored. It does manage to show a slight glimmer of a good idea/story. However it is poorly executed and continuously provides a relentless assault on both the visual and mental parts of peoples minds. With its terrible graphics and horiffic story, it made it impossible to play. Aside from the 'fantastic' amount of frames per second when I walked near an elevator, I was able to do nothing but fail to complete a mission as my game would not run past a low 12 fps. My computer plays 'Arma 3' on high at 38 fps and 'Battlefield 3' on high at 43 fps. Yet a game with graphics at par to a nintendo 64, I can not play it at past 12 fps on low graphics. Do not get this game because of the fasad of a good story. All it provides is bordem and poor execution.
9790	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥, I CAN WRITE A RIVEW , WELL â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ ASS GAME 0/10
5916	0	a	It was unplayable because it would not load.
9644	1	a	  I really enjoyed this RPG game and I enjoyed the first 10 seconds of the charecter creation. The problem I got is when I got to the part were you get your first rifle and you have to go to the Medical bay where the woman said they do operations I have 4 gbs and my frame rates dropped to 2 so I had to fight on 2 fps and I managed to win, I got outside THE VIEW WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!
4998	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game. DO NOT PLAY IT Do not even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing look at it. I would rather â¥â¥â¥â¥ing strangle babies, kick kittens and rapepeople than play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game again. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1398	1	a	Downloaded game, entered the city, got into a mission, I rekt a guy, guy accused me of hacker.   10/10 would Rekt him again.
10576	1	a	even the installer is broken
7017	0	a	Not going to get into the problems, but this is a very flawed gem if you like these types of games. MY GRIPE Is it doesn't seem to be workig since I upgraded and got a new rig with a GTX 960. It appears others have issues with this and there maybe compatability issues with this GPU and APB that should be fixed
3769	0	a	To summarise before I begin: No.  The game cannot stand from the bloody, mangled mess it is in now.   A small player base which consists primarily of people with similar gametime to mine steal all the fun and prevent new players from being properly introduced to the game. The reason being that new players have almost no chance of beating a good, long-term player and are forced to fight against them because of the small amount of new players and poor matchmaking.   Many people complain about an 'abundance' of hackers, I believe it is simply players that are too fast and familiar with the game for newbies. Doesn't mean it will be a good, fun or balanced experience though.  The gunplay is very fast and unbalanced and requires an itchy trigger finger, high situational awareness and map familiarity to win, so be warned, shooter conservationists.  The new weapons that are being released are typically only able to be purchased with real money. (You're talking $30 to $50 for a permanent, account-wide weapon.) These weapons are considered Pay-2-Win, although I find that every weapon is bad, until it is placed into the right hands. Especially shotguns.  I believe the game only shines through it's beautiful customisation, allowing players to create amazing, intricate articles of clothing, cars and player models. People's creations in the game could even be seen as a form of art.   However, despite this feature's potential, it simply asks too much from the real-life financial standpoint. Free-To-Play players are restricted to very small amounts of customisation and even people that spend stacks of cash on the game are forced to simplify their creations for inevitable reasons like hardware constraints and server storage limits.  I do not recommend this game at all, unless you have LOTS of cash to splash and/or are feeling compelled to play it for whatever reason... You have been warned.
7828	0	a	Classic game. But you don't want to put any money on it.
10317	1	a	This game isn't half bad; honestly I thought it was going to have the same or similar graphics as LOTRO but it surpassed my expecation of such. The keys and buttons are kinda hard to learn when you are so used to a certain system of keys, but once you get the hang of it the fights can go smoothly.
9384	0	a	Uninstall works perfect.
8995	1	a	Oh... This game.  This game is worth playing just to see how legendarly bad it is.  In my adventures during this game I made a topless dude in a G string with a pink mohawk with the utmost classy name 'Bondageslave' and trolled so hard that the butthurt admins banned me despite not breaking a single rule. There's not many games that has the potential lulz factor of how bad this game is and even less with butthurt admin, but I assure you the admins here are a breed of their own.  Never have I seen a more raging group of admins on anything. Not even TF2 servers. So yes, I do recommend it. For the wrong reasons? That depends how you look at it. But personally I have never laughed so hard in the 0.9 hrs i've had on this game, untill I got banned.  If you ever get the desire to troll for 0.9 hrs and don't mind installing game that takes roughly 50 minutes to a hour, I assure you that you'll never run across more vulnerable victims.  The game is bad but the lulz is good.
7786	0	a	Played this game within the first week it came out but quit less than an hour into it because it was simply too laggy to play. Tried playing it again earlier today and it's still too laggy to play. I have a decent spec computer and 100mbit internet.  My suggestion is to avoid the extreme load times and stuttering frames and laggy glitches by not installing this piece of garbage.
73	1	a	very good game. its like gta but without the strippers. i think the only problem with this game is is that there arent any tutorials or how tos when you first start so your kinda on your own in terms of how to customize things. friend me: thatguy622
390	1	a	It is very good game, but I don't like the method called 'PAY TO WIN' in it. The game is similar to the game series 'Grand Theft Auto' however apb is multiplayer and Free to Play Game. I really want you to try this game out. This game is taking a lot of time from you, because'When you get into the city there will be not way back!'
7890	0	a	This game is absolute disaster, it had multiple years to fix it. But it did squat but make p2w weaponry. This game is not worth it, PRERIOD.
4446	0	a	Absolutely the worst game I have ever played in my whole entire existence.
10537	1	a	This game is absolutely a wonderful F2P game, if you like shooters, high speed action, science fiction, etc... Especially now that the Dev's have come back to life!
4701	0	a	I love APB, but the game managers doesn't even care about their customers.
1509	1	a	Super game. been hacking since day one.   Fun to hear kids cry.  Helios hack FTW !!!
6969	0	a	I do not reccomend anyone to waste his time by playing this game. It's poorly made and very inbalanced. The match-making system is terribly broken. You'll often find yourself, a low lvl 5 guy against lvl 200 players. It's very frustrating, progress is very slow and unrewarding. The game is very poorly made and optimized, the physics engine is terrible, steering lags a whole 3-4 seconds making car driving close to imposible. The game is full of trolls and rammers and the overall atmosphere of this game is of hate. The most commonly typed sentence in this game is 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ y0u N00B di3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!' Many players were banned for no reason because of an upsurge of cheaters and with every patch the game just keeps getting worse, the only additions being new stuff to rob money from you with. I DO NOT Reccomend this garbage to anyone.
9512	1	a	this game is bert 
2466	1	a	F2P. Awesome game.
10266	1	a	fun looking game can not wait to lvl up
2464	1	a	addicted to this game probs my best game around at the moment cant keep off it
9220	0	a	spanning multi accounts, starting a civil war long ago against a clan in my own faction. death to RFDC lived on and the endless fun and hours of destruction will always have a place in my heart. but the devs have now become hackers and have abused their ways, the game is dying. faction wars and game polulation is down. i am sad to say it but fallen earth has fallen. and will not recover.
1257	1	a	this is one awesome game
5786	0	a	If you download this game you will find 3 important things: LAG,CHEATERS, and, the most important of all, UNINSTALL BUTTON.  Just...nope, it doesn't deserve to be played
4630	0	a	i not cant play..... Why? the launcher of â¥â¥â¥â¥ download to 32KBPS!!! 256 MB In 32KBPS = 160 minutes To wait!! NOPE unistall.. my internet download to 350KBps.... and... is a pay2win.... only good game P2W is World of tanks... other nope.
2676	1	a	This game is fun...
5668	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ cant even join servers
8569	0	a	The admins are clueless, the mods who are not employed with the company are ignorant, the cheaters have taken over the game, Deep Silver is ruining their game, the admins are nowhere to be seen, the only employee who appears to have any form of discussion with players is CM Tiggs, i never met her, even though when i was a GM/CM over at T3Entertainment, i heard she use to be a CM with HanbitSoft, even though I'm not sure if that was true or not. I have nothing against her personally, but she needs to do something with the forum mods and get rid of them.   Depsite the BS. I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.
217	1	a	about the game: The good, the bad and the ugly  The good:  -there is no other game like it -its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free -awezome costumization of character, symbols and cars  The bad:  -HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review) -every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed. -a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)  The ugly:  -toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game) -its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.  Notes:  -it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.  -in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.  -the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.  -because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)  -you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it
449	1	a	I freaking love it! lol. Great game but somtimes its hella laggy. But over all I recomend this game for people who like Saints Row and GTA. Its pretty much kinda like it but more like GTA and less like Saints Row.
2710	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this with The Respectable Gentlemen Crew on Guardian Server. Lots of great times and laughs. 10/10 would play again.
9070	1	a	nice game fun stuff and the good stuffssssss
7772	0	a	I couldn't even play the freaken game because the stupid sky and screen of the game kept giltching and i couldn't even see. whatever you do save your memory and save your money. i would give it a 1 out of 10 if they could fix it. which might not even happen. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2851	1	a	Great game if your a fan of GTA series.
5950	0	a	At first I didn't read the below comments to make sure I was unbiased when trying out this game. But then I realized how fun and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is at the same time. Furthermore I hated the sheer verticalality of some weapon tiers in combat scenarios. In the end, after getting stomped by gold threat players with weapons that were far superior than the no-mod , non-arma - defualt weapon, I just gave up.   Fun game. But overall a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The guns that aren't immediately available to new players take a alot of time and effort to grind. The same guns also would've made the experience for a new player more tolerable if they had the same firepower than many cash-cows were throwing into the game. This stratification of gear implied by contractor levels and real-money spent make a new player's experience hell. The fact that you can easily bypass the contract level purchase requirements though the ARMA store to access even better versions of the same weapon you grind for is only a hint of pay to win, in the fact that you can just straight up buy the best weapons for every combat scenario.  Missions are Repetitive, and more often than not an Defensive team will be almost impenetrable. Even though an offending team can split up and flank, the defending team has less area to cover and thus has multiple lines of sight to each other and to the invading team as well.  Cash Shop is very expensive. $5+ dollars for a 30 day rental, 25 dollars for a permanent weapon. Don't even begin on the cars. The quaity of your car lends itself to how troll you can be when you decide to take a package holdout mission and you drive around with said package.  Even BLR has a permanent weapon purchase mechanic, and that game has it's own share of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ problems.  In hindsight, don't play this game unless you have tons of cash to throw around for OP guns and fast cars. One of the most expensive f2p games I've ever seen.
9445	0	a	If this game had players, and an ACTUAL endgame BESIDES PVP... it would be pretty damn good.. but the flaws in the game are just so ridiculous it's beyond the scope of f2p to even tolerate. They STILL havent done anything significant with the game despite having years of live time.   Skip it, and just let it die gracefully.
8242	0	a	bad drive big bogs :D and were is cover :D
5138	0	a	I am going to compare this to GTA Online or Saints Row as it is that style of gameplay  1. Acess to fun:  GTA Online, I have to boot up the game, click on online, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  Saints Row, I have to boot up the game, join a friend, start the game, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  In APB Reloaded, I have to boot up the start menu, update the game, start up the game itself (Which sometimes opens up a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Facebook 'like this' page and you have to click Start again), Then select the character, then join the correct district then select the spawn and then have no idea where to go because you selected the wrong district and have no idea where to go.  Character Customisation:  In GTA Online it is the worst character creation ever, you choose the grandparents and parents and that's how your characer looks like, no wonder my character looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t  In Saints Row 3 and 4 the customisation is great. It leaves enough options to be extremely customizable but few enough to be simple  In APB Reloaded it is like Saints Row but the camera angles are confusing, the advanced mode gives too many options while the quick mode gives too little options. It is the worst of both worlds.  And that's as much of the game I know of. As it took too long to get any-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-where with the game as it was complicated and boring to figure out where to go.
4896	0	a	This is the worst game of my life cant even open and i think also not connected to steam need wad â¥â¥â¥â¥ email adress agn so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot games. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IS JUZ WASTING UR TIME!!!! NOT RECOMMENDED
5048	0	a	This is the welfare version of GTA.. but worse, waaayyy worse
9898	1	a	itÂ´s a good game, a bit difficult the further into the game you get. However, some obstacles have not stopped anyone from trying until you passed it. Any good gamer can agree.
5854	0	a	No. Not right now
3392	1	a	this game is really fun and just a great game 
3533	1	a	a good cops vs crime game but it is very odd also it is confusing for new players includeing me but i like the open world also it reminds me of saints row 2      scoring------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note This game is ran on a lower end pc        look 8/10 this aint no gta 5 Gameplay 9/10 it is very fun and silly Restricteveness 10 for most restrictive 1 for least 4/10 restricting at the begining  overall 8.999999999999/10  i recommend this game and it is even better with frends  if you have any   also i probaly have typos heck even in this sentince
10736	1	a	An update?  RISE MY BEAUTY, BESTOW MY LIBRARY WITH YOUR GRACE ONCE AGAIN.
1696	1	a	Nothing's more fun than cruising down the street with three guys hanging out the windows gunz blazing. The customization is really impressive, you can create characters and vehicles fresh from imagination and even compose a little tune that plays when you kill someone =) Oh, and it's free!
5609	0	a	If you have 2GB RAM and a graphics card below 9400 GT generation then this game wont start
8011	0	a	The video is nothing like the gameplay witch I hate games like that and I think the basic idead of this game was to copy gta and if thats it F u cause gta is way better than this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥!
9506	1	a	its god game but i hate when i kill someone he spawns after 20 seconds
8554	0	a	looks like a great game to play with your mates, but it would not open/run for me and it was laggin my PC so i got rid of it pertty quick
3288	1	a	I greatly engoy this game. heck, its my favorite game. the animations are a bit rough but if i had to choose i would pick apb reloaded. good job creators.
597	1	a	I know I put recommended, but it's only really because the game is free. It is extremely pay to play/win, but there is decent gear you can get for free. I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good â¥â¥â¥â¥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
4098	0	a	gta 5's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ younger brother
10493	1	a	Ive played this years ago when it first came out. I was kind of unimpressed with the beginning area where you have to fight your way outside, but once in the outer region, it was very neat.. Lots of quests to do, crafting is good, the economy in game was good.. ie putting things on the broker, and I did the questline where you can craft a atv i think it was and then motorbikes and cars. This game is definatly worth playing, altho like I said the first 10 minutes of it will make you wonder. Just hang in there ! I'm going to do a reinstall, myself.
8586	0	a	Its like Mexican Candy (No offence to Mexicans just a Joke) It Looks good but really Its â¥â¥â¥â¥. Worth your Time? Dont! you know the awncer, its like Going to the mexican store and getting the candy you are clearly gonna throw away is more worth your time.
7238	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
223	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
1327	1	a	Okay I only have a few hours on this game BUT I can honstely say for being 'FREE' it's not to bad. There is a P2W (Pay to Win for those who don't know) feel to it but not a lot of P2Wer's in the game the real problem are the hackers and oh so fearful 2 mp/h cars (You will die if struck by a car going 2 mph). AGAIN! It's free and not to bad of a game you will get mad here and there but that's life! Also so many hackers and A1 does nothing about them -_-
3097	1	a	Loved this before and after f2p great game with friends
5991	0	a	.
4371	0	a	After 1,700 hours of the same repetitive actions, no cover system or evasion system, Hackers galore, I'm giving up on APB. The game feels like it does when it was in Beta. Hardly any changes at all (there are changes but nothing that makes the game 'better' just more weapons added on to Armas to milk the Cash Cow that this game has become). Utterly dissappointed I spent so many hours of my life playing this game when I could have been doing something more cnstructive with my life. I highly recommend all to stay clear of the Trap that is APB: Reloaded and invest your time and money into something worth wild, and better, Like DayZ, or stocks from NASDAQ.
5729	0	a	Could be a great game, too bad its actual â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Its like GTA except covered in actual hackers and scumbags, even if you manage to try and fight as befitting a gangman (drive-by) you end up deader than a blood in crip territory alone. (Vehicle explodes in half an enemy mag).  I mean if you like stealing furniture like its the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Rodney King riots then I guess it's okay.
8427	0	a	The game looks cool just that I can't play the game it just crashes 
2469	1	a	No, I actually canÂ´t recommend this game to anyone. In the beginning youÂ´ll get kill-farmed by the veterans, the mission design is repetitive and the community is the worst IÂ´ve ever seen. Still, IÂ´ve played almost 450 hours with my two chars, so there has to be something with this game... Enjoy!^^
8929	1	a	I've only put a little over an hour... but man I am HOOKED. It takes a little getting used to, but the whole idea behind it brings a new perception to MMO's. The multiple item equips is awesome (especially how it shows on your body), the skills, the mounts (You get one for free at the begininning!). It is a little glitchy here and there, and the constant changing views can get a little annoying.. but past that it is a good game to get, especially if you want to play with friends (there's a reason why it's an MMO). Get it now! It's free and definitely worth the time!
553	1	a	This game is awesome
8078	0	a	i played this game about a few months ago, and lets just say it was awful  1, the game looked awful  2, the most people you are going to see are very high levels that will pretty much kill you in one shot  3, you are most likely going to not even make it past the first mission  this game was a horrible experince to me and i personnaly never want to go back, the game was probably good 4 years ago but now its just a waste of time
5194	0	a	It won't run!
4753	0	a	Boring and clunky. Games looks average.
3081	1	a	Its pretty good but can be improved 
6674	0	a	Terribly wasted potential. I was in the Beta for this game many years ago, and I even pre-ordered it when it came out. However, after Real Time World went under, and it was picked up again by Reloaded, everything went down the toilet. As said countless times before, the customization is amazing, and I really wish it could see it's full potential. However as we've seen, that's never going to happen.
9466	1	a	After having a little experience on this I can say that this is possibly the greatest Free to Play i've ever came across, the world is relatively big and the whole gameplay is intense!
7015	0	a	I Play this for may Hours. Many Many hours through there opener not steam and well it got worse as i played i loved this game Sunk hours of my life in to it but in the end Quit from disappointment the game population has dissappered as well.  I could go well in to depth about why im dissapointed but it would be very very long
2708	1	a	If you have a good graphics card, but to catch the realism of the graphics in GTA'll see.  Also, any items that unlock the fun of feeling can make you a basket case.  In addition, the items are free to unlock the fun you can feel that you can customize.  However, as mentioned above, this game is really high, or if you will need a computer with good specifications.
8439	0	a	I played this a while ago and I can't really remember it so it was probably not that good
10694	1	a	Ah yes i remember this
51	1	a	Nice game ;D I thinkin this game need lithuania language ^^
3926	0	a	Spent about 10 minutes trying to get this game to work on my computer. Won't launch at all, unless you count an irritating Facebook popup. Complete failure to launch for a game that by all reports has serious connectivity issues and a questionable business model. Coupled with a game that wants me to essentially disable the functionality in windows that allows my security software to function, and I could not reccomend this to anyone.
10468	1	a	this game is fun for a while however after you start to get far // the second map you need to pay to have a bigger poket for money and i lost lots of money due to this fact and now you need to pay to get more money making this game allmost no fun in the end.
1686	1	a	APB is a very nice game but too bad I mean get stuck in the game I play 2-3 minutes and locks. Pretty please help me. Thanks
3821	0	a	APB is a very...complicated game. Do you want to become a criminal, and just go to town on a city full of innocent people with riches worth taking, and start massive riots against the police and government? Do you want to be a peacekeeper, and maintain order in a broken city by breaking criminal operations and protecting the innocent? Then what the F*** are you doing playing APB Reloaded? This game is NONE of what it looks like on the surface. After putting more hours than I'm ever thought I would, I can say I can make a worthwhile review.  Let's weigh the Pro's and the Con's  Pro's:  *The game, for a free-to-play, is very good looking. The graphics as far as shadowing and detail goes are top-notch.  *The Character Customization is outstanding. You can literally make whatever you want, within reason. But this can also lead to some bad stuff. See Con's for more info.  *The game has regular seasonal events for Easter, Halloween and Christmas. These game modes, sans Easter, are mainly in the Arena 'Fight Club' mode where certain things have been changed to fit the season. The Christmas one is especially good.  *The game has a very large variety of guns, but more can be said about this in the Con's.  *The game does offer variety to activities depending on the faction that you choose. Criminals can do different things than Enforcers and vice-versa  *There are several instances to play in, so you never really feel left out.   Con's:  *The game is a powerhouse to run. Most PC's won't even be able to handle it, and the 'low' settings don't really help. Most people have to use community made mods to lower the settings down even further than the game allows just to play it. That isn't entirely something that's in GamersFirst's control, but the idea that an outside party mod has to be active for some people to even play is a bit offputting.  *The game has seriously unstable connection problems. Countlessly, you will be lagged out of districts, and while you're in the server, you will be bouncing all over the place trying to get a grip on where you're going, only to shoot back several rooms because the server couldn't keep up. This is a glaring issue, and only exacerbates other problems.  *One such problem includes actually landing shots on enemies. This game has some of the most inconsistant damage I've ever seen in a game, and the shot registration is abysmal. You will find yourself losing gunfight after gunfight simply because the other person is better connected to the server than you, or his gun suddenly does more damage than before. Sometimes, your gun will kill someone in 4 shots, and the next person you shoot takes 9-10 shots to put down. This whole game can be summed up as 'Inconsistant.' That's the bottomline.  *Just because there's a lot of guns, doesn't mean they're all different. There are a lot of guns that function exactly like other guns. The Joker Carbine acts just like the STAC-10. The NTEC acts just like the AR-15. This doesn't even touch on the Snipers. Quite literally, the guns are recycled and released to the public for actual money, where they act just like the last gun they sold. This one just looks different.  *There is a large pay-to-win gap in this game. Most guns can be earned in-game, and some guns can even be made permanent. However, most of the time, you'll be renting leased weapons, and these will only last up to 7 days. Some guns you have to actually pay to make them permanent. This is also an issue in the 'Premium' system, where if you pay for a set amount of time, you gain more money and experience toward your standing. While this isn't too bad and is nowhere near as bad as some other games doing this, it's still a bit unfair to the people just getting into the game.  *The game is very confusing at first, and there is no good tutorial. The way it works is, when you start, you have to gain up reputation with certain people to gain rewards, raise your standing with them to get more rewards, and to increase your threat. The higher your win/loss ratio in missions is, the better your threat is. The three primary tiers are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. There are also ranks within that. Nowhere in the game is this explained to you, or at least explained well. You will have no idea what you're doing for a long while.  *The game has horribly unbalanced matchmaking. More often than not, you will be pitted against people who are far better armed, skilled and familiar with the map than you are, and you will be shut down again and again, because the game will refuse to give you people around your level. Your reputation, Threat, or overall level does not affect who you will get matched up against. I have seen Bronze players go up against Gold players and get utterly annihilated. This kind of thing is far from fair.  *The game has one of the absolute worst communities I have ever seen on a MMO, no, a GAME before. The people on this game range from little kids screaming about how bad you are in the chatbox, to grown men whining and complaining about weapons and tactics you're using. And GOD HELP YOU if you're a Bronze or a Silver on this game. To be a Gold, is to be the scum of the earth in most cases. Golds constantly and consistantly berate Silvers and Bronzes for the most mundane of reasons, and will go out of their way to make your time on this game as unpleasant as possible. Very few people will actually answer any questions you have about the game while playing, and are more likely to make fun of you for not knowing than just telling you. This Con is the most deciding of why this game just isn't worth the time.  *Because of the community being as disgusting as it is, this brings up a very big issue in the Character Customization. With the massive scale in which you have control over your character, comes every negative you can think of to compromise it. You will constantly see fat black men with giant, often neon colored, afros in limited to almost no clothing at all running around, or you may even see Adolf Hitler running around. This is also a problem with the fact that the naming system for your characters is unrestricted, so racial and offensive names are abundant. For every good costumed character running around, there's a 'TyroneFriedChicken' to muck it all up.  *While the game likes to parade the idea of 'FairFight' around like it's some form of trophy, the game is still overrun with hackers. With constant new hacking tools emerging every time another is addressed, you'll constantly see this as an issue. And while the response time to have them removed permanently from the game is rather quick(Most of the time), it's still the fact that they're there in the first place that makes this a problem.   In closing, APB Reloaded is an ex-pay to play MMO shooter with subpar action and goofy as hell ragdoll physics. But it's a dying game, and with the community punching more and more holes in the sinking boat that is this game, and further alienating and shunning new players, it will eventually sink completely. I can not recommend this game to anyone with the condition that it's in. All the FairFight updates in the world can't save this game if the community won't help to keep it afloat.

10042	0	a	There's a bug that I don't know how to fix: Every time I start the game, all I see is gray, a few textures here and there but pretty much nothing. the textures show up for about a second right when I start the game. Can anybody help?
637	1	a	Awsome game with many unique class sets and an AMAZING collection of clothes,vehicles etc.!!!!!!Game isnt easy but after a bit youll get a hang of it but never give up if you die or lose your valuables.HAVE FUN PLAYING APB Reloaded! -smackr757
3587	1	a	Wont open, crashes whenever I try to play. rip.  Though what i've heard from my close friends, it's basically GTA for free, which is nice.

5320	0	a	Piece of trash pay to win and matches you up with high level â¥â¥â¥â¥ faces. 0/10 uninstalled this waste of space, time and effort
9607	0	a	Freemium trash game. You're not allowed to use the chat unless you pay. Can't do half the content unless you pay. Have a money cap unless you pay...  Unplayable unless you pay. 1/10, crappy freemium games that are money greedy. You will regret every minute invested, when a moderator bans you for chatting, or when you find out about the money cap / other p2w aspects, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7508	0	a	This game is one of the worst pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've ever played in my life. I had a LOT of hours into it without the steam version, so I believe I know what i'm talking about. Worst Cop vs Criminal game Of ALL TIME. You start out with the Star 556 and some piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ pistol.Well,i'll inform you now that the gun mechanics are SUPER unrealistic,you can have someone take a BUTT ton on bullets to only turn around and shoot you with thier premium gun Oh?You said premium Yep,Premium. G1 wants you to pay for guns and bundles at RIDICULOUSLY high prices so you can have a advantage over other players. The game loves to do that to people. Match making is pure â¥â¥â¥â¥, running rampant with hackers who have NICE â¥â¥â¥ guns who dominant everyone who moves. It also seems as if Criminals have a advantage over Cops, like they just DO BETTER.  This game is awful. I spent 40$ on it. Never agian. Stay away from it. This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.

1333	1	a	Most definitely one of the best games I've played. Fantastic graphics, fun gameplay, and with all you can customize with your player and such is awesome. One downside is it seems to be poorly optimized. I can run medium graphics on most, if not all of my other games but this one has a horrible lag issue. Other than that, fantastic game.
1455	1	a	Fun game with my friends .
2733	1	a	Nice game, i've been playing as a criminal
7985	0	a	The customisation is immense, and it was enjoyable buying a new car and pimping it up. Being able to play while listening to my own music and hearing that music muffled blasting out of the car when I left it really made me feel like this was me doing the crime. I found driving around committing small smash and grabs did get a bit tedious but I did have some fun playing with real world mates in this game. The weapon and firing part of the engine is a bit wack and playing with the default guns against people who have rented or paid real money for better guns felt totally pointless.   I did really enjoy playing this game but the higher the level I got the worse the attitude of my team mates became. I counted one night I was booted from 9 out of 10 attempts to play a team mission. I frequently got private message abuse after being kicked.  I have played MMOs and FPSs online for 15 years and these are the worst players I have seen for welcoming people with less skill than them. This is the sole reason I stopped playing.   I would however not recommend it as the game modes and ways to make money are not as immersive as other games out there even though this is FTP.

10764	1	a	One of the few true good games in recent years. Skill based, as all great games are, and a lot of fun.
9998	1	a	So far It's quite very nice. Had fun playing it
10819	1	a	'Tribes is about freedom. Skiing gives speed, jetpacks give height, spinfusors give a sense of power and skill, automatic weapons a sense of determination.'
6277	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.
7743	0	a	It may be free but not worth downloading its just not worth it in my opinion but look at some gameplay and see if its your sort of thing but from me 5/10
245	1	a	play this game its amazing with friends
10610	1	a	One of the best games that ever touched me.
1877	1	a	Gimme that punk! &lt;3
9781	0	a	I'd recomend it, but the Devs are lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that only care about money, and not the players. They won't get up off their lazy asses and update the game, as the graphics are outdated, and it's full of bugs and glitches, leveling up it painfully slow (at least for me, anyways) it lags like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and there's loads of spammings in the help chat when you are trying to ask a question if you're at the time when Cylen isn't on.   However there's the good side. You can get helpful players that get bored of the game, and go around helping people. The missions aren't too hard wth a friend, and it's really helpfull to join clans, ecxept some can have control freak â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s as leaders, so it's best to join a small clan, as this way it's all closer and easier to communicate with clan members.  Pro's:   Helpful players  Nice missions  Addicting  Con's:  Lazy Devs will never update this game again  Graphics outdated  Full of Bugs  Leveling up is painfully slow  Lags like a baws  Spammers and adbots in chat   My rating: 4/10 
3368	1	a	Love It
518	1	a	Very good game, but owners are bad. It can be the most played game ever but G1( R.I.P.) Prepare yourself on server lags and fps drops. :)
8457	0	a	I played this a while ago and I can't really remember it so it was probably not that good
70	1	a	this game is awsome i love it so much,everyone should play it and please don't make it to cost money
3516	1	a	This is a good multiplayer game to play with and meet new friends. Although the majority of the community is somewhat backward when it comes to social skills.   There are some problems with server performance and hits registering which still need to be fixed. The developers keep releasing P2W weapons that are basically re-skins of stock weapons. Joker boxes are, well, a joke: you just get trails for guns you already have... unless you spend hundreds of $ (which is exactly what they want).   Snipers ruin the game.   Cheaters are still a problem, although they have a new anti-cheat (PunkBuster was a joke).  Character customization is good; however, the designer isn't very well optimized or user friendly.   People make a fuss that this game is Pay to Win but I actually don't think it is. An experienced player can do just as much damage with the stock weapons (some of them broken).   I do, however, think that charging people to unlock car parts is pretty low (you have to buy car parts with real money).  Also, you have to be certain ranks to use mods like car surfer etc. which I think is silly since it gives high ranks an even bigger advantage.   Matchmaking is shocking - you have r22 vs. r255 - r255 silvers in a bronze district etc. Matchmaking should go on rank, not threat. This also creates a problem with idiots who decide to 'dethreding xD' [dethreating] in your mission by completely messing it up, so they can decrease their threat level.   Premium isn't implemented very well - it counts down even though you're not playing. I'd like to see premium depleat per playing time. As it stands, premium is a gimmick.   G1 credits are overpriced, and most of the content isn't worth it.   Overall, it's a good game if you're not playing with nubs - otherwise it can get annoying. Gameplay is also somewhat repetative (and they keep fixing bugs that make the game funny).
10248	1	a	its REALLY. i mean REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY laggy close to the start of the game. im not going to give any spoilers but close to where u meet the first people that tha help u. im talk extremly laggy. but mabey it can be fixed in the otions, how knows, but i sorda like the idea of the game
2181	1	a	You know, ever since I got my new gaming computer and a lot of money to spend on Steam, I thought I would return to this game and give it a look. Now I read all of the more popular reviews, and I do not deny their complaints. Unbalance and camping is an issue, I am sad to say I take part in this. But heres what people don't understand... this game requires some actual f***king teamwork to do the missions effectively and to plow right through the camping team. The game does not look the best, but it is one of the most flawed masterpieces that are free I have seen. It is the GTA: Online we want. You could run it on a potato with a screen attached to it and it would still run. 3 almost 4 years later, they are still updating and fixing the game! I played GTA: Online on console, it got boring rather quick because there is no real challenge or anything really, it is all created by the players themselves in the bad sense. Here, they have systems to keep the system balanced while also having the difficulty up high.  Where it shines...  Where this game shines is in the customization department. It has been rated one of the best customization system in gaming because of how diverse you can make your character from everyone else. Both sides have their pros and cons and their balance is equal due to the nature of getting the same weapons. Veterans are rewarded better guns but they are not too much of an improvement. Criminals have easier opprotunities to earn money outside of missions but they don't make as much as Enforcers. Enforcers don't have as many opprotunities to earn money outside of missions but they get 2x the amount of money for winning missions. It is all about skill.  Where it falls...  Where this game falls flat is in some of the open world aspects. Emotes are locked off for some reason and the higher your rank, the more you unlock. NPC's all have repeating player models but at least have different languages. Grenades are delayed in killing a player if it is right at their feet, vehicles driven by enemies can run you over and kill you at anything higher than 5 miles an hour. Free to play players are given limitations on how complex their character can look, and complexity is added with decals, customization, etc of clothing, though the preset clothes offer insanely high complexity if they are worn which could conflict your outfit, which you get 2 slots for outfits and an additional one for completing the tutorial objectives. Vehicles handle decently but good luck trying to go in a fast car and not get lag from the high amount of pop in on max settings. Lag is caused by pop in and that one prick from a 3rd world country who wants to play on an english server and has bad internet. And finally weapons tend to get very unbalanced if your up close and personal, there is no melee attacking so you have to spray more bullets into the bad guy's face than they do to you.  It may sound like I am ripping on this game, but it is still a more playable GTA than any other gta games on steam.
4085	0	a	Do not get fooled by my gameplay, the game is now P2W after G1 bought it P2W= Pay to win. if you like P2W games then this game is for you.
6892	0	a	i made an account, went to validate my account , it said 'page not found ' i repeated it couple of times... didn't work, i went for help to the website but to get help i need to be logged in... 10/10 amazing gameplay (sarcasm)
373	1	a	 APB Reloaded Review
8029	0	a	Some good things about the game :  - Best character creator I've ever seen  - Nice take on cops and robbers  - Great ways to customize clothing and vehicles  - You can create your own music  - Wide range of weapons and clothes  - Gameplay is fun for a while  - 2 reasonably big maps to play on  - Great leveling system  *Instead of actual levels, you level up contracts, that will reward you with new vehicles, clothing, weapons, customization options, and new contacts to level up.    Some bad things about the game :  -The game has a P2W (Pay-to-Win) feel to it  *Great weapons cost real money and are very overpowered compared to the in-game weapons  - F2P weapons are very similar  *Several of the same weapon, with different buffs  - FPS isn't very smooth unless you have a good PC  - Driving is a bit slow, reactions are off  *Turning has a very slight delay after pressing the key  - Absolutely terrible ranking system  *The game's 'Threat Level' is basically a ranking to show off your skill in matches.  *The game has districts dedicated for each rank (Gold, silver bronze) but players of that rank aren't forced to join one of those servers, resulting in a high amount of golds in silver districts (Very little, if any, silvers), and many golds/silvers in bronze districts (Few bronzes). This makes it hard for bronzes and silvers to level up.   The game is fun overall but being P2W ruins it for me. I don't know if many others have had a similar issue, but whenever the game is installed to my pc, it slows down my performance overall, but goes away once uninstalled. The game's worth trying out, but don't expect for it to be the greatest thing ever.
7011	0	a	Im checking how many hours i have because i don't want to reinstall. I don't know who would want to, with a game as P2W as this
5781	0	a	no no no no no no no no no after waiting for 2.5 hours for this joke to download then had to register to play it only to find out i have to download it again while its just finished downloading i will unistall after this full stop.
1073	1	a	Good game, terrible company. By the time you read this the servers will prolly be dead.
2385	1	a	I just mess up all the other people's stuff, like 1. he parked down his car next to the mission building 2. I crash into his car 3. everybody yays   oh me :(
1300	1	a	You'll regret spending money in this game. A little, too much money.
3072	1	a	seriously, wtf are you doing reading this? PLAY THIS GAME!!  APB is an online 3rd person â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t simulator.  Hours of fun can be had and sometimes you just cant help yelling 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!' at your screen as you get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you.  Though nothing beats the feeling of rolling in a car through the city with some good friends who you know got your back.
4872	0	a	After a few years since i played this game, the cars still drive like on ice and there is no balance. hate it
5689	0	a	This game fails on the most basic of level: being entertaining.
171	1	a	Very gud
3044	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Game
9852	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)

5123	0	a	It's meh. Really cool concept, good gameplay (if it works well, which it didn't on my old computer, and its performance still has some problems on my university wifi [not the game's fault, just a note]), but my only complaint is that it's Pay-to-Win,   Really sad that they killed such a cool game with such a horrible practice.  If you don't mind dumping money into a game to make it playable (or you don't mind making yourself so OP that the game is too easy [I know lots of you MMO players out there already do it]), then you'll enjoy this TPS, faction-based-warfare MMO.   Otherwise: avoid.
5537	0	a	Bad game, pay to win.
8781	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.
8475	0	a	Doesn't even work. Says i have to verify my account, after i verify, it still says i have to verify. So i verify again, it says i still have to verify. So i verify... 
8857	1	a	I think this game will appeal to you if you are a certain kind of person. Do you like Firefly or Mad Max? Does the post disaster/apocalyptic setting appeal? Do you like melancholy, moody music? Do you tend to like more serious 'grown up' games that allow true role playing? Are you happy to wander around on your own, sometimes for long stretches of time, without seeing a soul? Are you more of a loner (a strange question for an MMO perhaps)? Are you more of a calm person who takes gaming slowly rather than rushing to experience a game in the shortest possible time? If the answer is mostly yes this game could be for you...  For me, the atmosphere in this game is second to none. Fantastic music, incredible view distance that really hammers home the immense size of the game (around 1000 square kilometres I believe - to put that into perspective Skyrim is around 40 I think) and true freedom to go pretty much wherever you want right from the very start of the game. Note though that I play as a single player - I'm not a clan type of person - so I can't really tell you much about the social side of the game. It is fairly quiet of late - not too many players - but that suits me fine.  It's certainly not a polished experience but then, if you're anything like me, that won't matter in the slightest. There's plenty of minor bugs although hardly any will stop progress (a simple relog usually sorts out most things) and there are plenty of minor gameplay things to moan about but, overall, the game is very unique and well worth the download. A huge thing in its favour is that it's a true free to play game. You can play the entire game without spending any real world money. Real world money will get you cool items to wear, cool vehicles, nice buffs and such but almost all of it can also be purchased with in game earned currency if you are patient and keep an eye on the auction house for bargains. It's also worth noting that a lot of the coolest, unique weapons and clothing items can only be earned through questing.  I'm not going to go too heavily into the mechanics of the game - it's pretty standard MMO levelling and crafting (but a very deep and rewarding crafting system) and such but it is one of the very few MMO's with real time skill based combat - think first person shooter - and the whole experience of the game is very 'manual' - nothing's on auto pilot - it's all on you to use your skill to stay alive basically.  Right, I think I've talked enough now...
1315	1	a	This game is like GTA but a little bit friendlier
7833	0	a	Don't bother, save yourself
2420	1	a	nice game but there is too many hackers...
2037	1	a	Not good as gta but its fun.
10563	1	a	The update has brought the fun back to the game. It's wonderful to have such a unique shooter active again. Pairs well with scotch.
7181	0	a	Can be a very fun game. I was a criminal (obiously who downloads a game like this to be a cop). The game was amasing before they made it a pay to win with alot of hackers everywhere. All the guns bought with ingame currency are crap compaired to the guns bought with real money.  I also noticed from day 1 that for some reason the turning in cars is very delayed, at first i thought it was my computer as i was playing on a acer aspire laptop. Got a $1600 gaming pc that i built myself, turning still as delayed as before.   It can be fun with friends or alone, but the cops dont really do anything. My brother and I saved up together so i could buy a van. Thought we would have alot of fun robbing store fronts and running from the cops. Finaly got the van. Do alot of robberys. Got bored. Do a robbery litteraly infront of a cop. He just sits there watching us fill the van with TVs and safes and does nothing. Finaly got a cop to chase me. He drives straight into a wall when i turn because he for some reason cant turn.  Its a good game but its not worth the time you have to put into it for it to be fun. You have to try it out for your self and see if you like it. If your looking for a Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row feeling game this is not it.
4263	0	a	Used to be fun back at the day but let's have a review shall we? No? Well go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself. This game used to be the best back when it came out. It's like GTA but free version and pay to win version. As you spawn... you look ugly af and ugly â¥â¥â¥ car. Not even a car! Just steal one. But then you see other people with awesome â¥â¥â¥ guns, cars, outfits. Can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ pretty much. Well... dissapointed..
4108	0	a	Everyone uses grenades , it has unfair matchmaking and you know when it has a pack for $100 it's Pay 2 Win  Update : So it's been a year since my review so I thought I'd come back and try the game and it was awful , nothing has changed and the game feels even MORE broken than when I last played it , when I was trying to join a mission I was put against 3 players who were VERY experienced , I've only leveled up twice or something but I was going against guys that were in the Gold levels and had awesome gear while I was their with a crappy AK and 0 teammates , yes , the game wasn't giving me teammates. I just could not continue playing , it was so bad so after a year I can say this , it's worse than it was a year ago.
3412	1	a	Man, what can I say? I'm basically playing my character from San Andreas, busted out of Federal Prison after 10 years!   Different city, sure. But the street feel is familiar. High nostalgia hit for the violent 300lb homie covered in badly spelled jail tattoos. MO Cops and Robbers. Ultraviolent roadrage incidents. Taggin' grafitti spots. Rollin' in a group. Customizing clothes to wear or sell. Kitting out mods to make life bearable against live opponents. 4 levels of Threat: Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold...Open Bounties on Prestige 5 Enforcers and Notorious Criminals. Decent variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock.  Cons:- not real minuses, but worth noting. Playing from Australia on Han server, expect noticable lag if map population is over 40. Still playable with up to 60 on a map, but you better let someone closer to the server drive. Much past that and it's not great. There will be undrawn walls to collide with, stuttered audio and ghosting. But you can always hit the Marina Social District and work on designs, or swap map instances to a less populated map. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics can be difficult to use. Important to pick the closest server. Match making can feel a bit off at times.  Pros: Multiple instanced maps. 3 mission districs with average threat level displayed, and open conflic maps where the matchmaking is turned off, plus Fight Club. But I won't talk about Fight Club. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics are easy to learn. Same as basic movement substituting handbrake for jump. If you're a GTA fan who just wants to play Cops and Robbers with some open-world interactions and a story if you want it, this could well be the game for you. If matchmaking is off, or teams are unbalanced, you can call for backup.  Fairfight Anti Hacking seems to work, not much problem with hackers these days. The ban announcements pop up in the chat window for everyone to see. Doesn't appear to be Pay-to-Win, they claim tactics can win over load-out. I've seen that, too. Gold players will hand you your â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless you're an exceptional lower Threat player, in which case you'll go up in rating faster.   This is an &lt;R&gt; rated game. Not for kids. Thought I should mention that. Bombings, Arson, Carjackings, Muggings, Ram-Raids, money laudering, automatic weapons and bad language. It's rated &lt;R&gt; for a m___________g reason, yeah?   Welcome to San Paro.
10667	1	a	I have like 5 minutes on record.
4280	0	a	I dont write alot of reviews for games like these, but found it necesarry at this point. The game is breathtaking in its world and has a great character customization. The community (atleast for me on the EU servers, im an expat from america) was horrible. The matchmaking paired me up with Gold level players over and over and over and over again. I was getting my a** handed to me 100% of the time i played this game. Even though the game isnt pay to win, you still cant buy a gun forever. You have to renew it every 10 days. Unless you pay real money, you cant really connect to a gun and know you have it forever (which i kinda like when i play shooters, im not adaptable like that with my guns). And the problem with the gold players they match me with 100% of the time on every district is these people have maxed out everything, and put 100 bucks into the game. Besides those points, APB is a great game and I do recommend it if your ready to get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you for 24 hours and on.

9024	1	a	This is the MMO that I keep coming back to. If you want crafting, questing and sandbox, some would say one cannot go with the other, but it works here. There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs. Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps. To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once. Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt. Although its F2P i have played with and without subs and I have not really seen a differance. But for $10 a month you cant go wrong.
1057	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
6110	0	a	its crap
3931	0	a	Worst game I've ever played. Performance issues everywhere.
2960	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs.
9545	0	a	DO NOT.... DOWNLOAD... THIS GAME!!!!!  It is quite a buggy, fustrating mess of a game that is trying to be fallout but with mmo but fails because while fallout was more an experience with a narrative, fallen earth is just quests with little unique background interaction, i ran around the world for 2 hours and the only out of quest experience i had was finding a glitch that made me go though a tree and end up on top of it. if it wasnt abit too big to play for the lols i would say, play it for the lols but dont even try.
6880	0	a	0.01/10  This game is one of the worst 3rd person shooter ever made. The developers don't listen to the community and what the community wants in the game. The over-pricing of guns and clothes in the ARMAS market is rediculous (DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH REAL MONEY). The server lag is insane and sometimes hard to deal with. Also, the amount of hackers you see is stupid and made me want to hack sometimes. The only good thing about this game is the customisation feature, but you have to pay for a premium to add more than like 10 decals to your car. This game is extremely pay to win, if you want anything good you have to pay with real money to get it.  Looking back now, I don't see any reason of how i could have played it for as long as I did.  I will never play it again.  
7634	0	a	no getting while head whielw weew
1283	1	a	very, very, very rage inducing. Hackers and lots of them.....Pay 2 Win.....
1784	1	a	Best game. When you really get down to it and ignore some of the connection problems that happen sometimes because of new updates and really understand the game and what to do. (Winning helps) It's really a great game. Tip: If ur a silver or a bronze unless you like challenges never join silver or gold servers, Bronze is where it's best at.
4076	0	a	Honestly as long as I played this game on my record none of it was me having fun because there is no balancing system which means you`re either on the team with people who Pay2Win or you`re on the losing team against the people who poured money in to there is no middle.  4/10
8487	0	a	Tis game is good if you want to smash your PC against a wall. It is full of pay-to-win players and is not fun unless you pay to win.Matchmaking is trash and the players are bad. DONT GET THIS GAME
5134	0	a	It's like cancer for cancer patients
4467	0	a	Installed the game Make myself on 100 min (with bugs) Started playing A bug don't let me play (flashing screen all the time) Uninstalled the game Reinstalled the game Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ Uninstalled the game 0/10 Gave me epilepsy- IGN
10137	1	a	Like a less fun version of fallout but its free!
3210	1	a	A great game of skill, stragagy and car surfing! I highly recomend this game to anyone.
567	1	a	It's ok
4513	0	a	this game is like crack. I know its â¥â¥â¥â¥ but god damn do i keep coming back to it for some reason. if you have played over 300 hours then yea your good. if your new get out while you can. this game sucks so hard with the servers lagging you out nearly eery 5 minutes. seriously though gave me some great memories and freinds but jesus is it awful. the best part is the customization because it makes gta and saints row customization look like all you can do is simply change if you have a mustache or not.
1456	1	a	crashed on startup.
2168	1	a	It's a really bad game that I happen to like.
641	1	a	i rate this game john cena out of 10. this game is like bilcosby its cute for one night and then next thing you know you get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and loose all the money you own and your viginity
4900	0	a	its crap you cant even play it it glitches out and screws your steam up i close it and it shows that app is still running 
3504	1	a	Great game!
8678	0	a	I dont have that many hours put into APB when I wrote this review. But from the time I've played APB at the lowest graphic settings and with 20 FPS I currently think its a decent game. It IS ONE OF THE FEW games that allow you to customize the absolute hell out of you and your cars. The combat system is OK, although infinite stamina isnt that realistic. 'Headshots' do the same damage on your head and your foot, which disables headshot instakills, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Now about the buying system in APB. You buy a guy in the game, a decent gun. Do you have it? Yes, for 10 days. ARMAS marktplace, you can buy quite a lot of decent and nice stuff. Like nice packs which can include clothes, weapons, attachments, modifications, vehicles and emotes. BUT the best guns in the game you HAVE to buy with REAL money. Which makes this game lean even more to a P2W. Now if they were to put the best guns and every gun in the in-game shop which you buy with your well earned in-game money AND make them last FOREVER and not for only 10 days. I mean, you dont buy a car IRL to drive 10 days with it and then bring it back to the car dealer, do you? You dont go to the mall to buy some bread, eat it, then crap it out and then bring it back to the mall, do you?  I would give this game a rating of 6.5/10. It has amazing customization, an interesting server setup and a free-roam to mission 'map' but the developers are greedy, very very very very greedy. They want you to BUY somewhat EVERYTHING in the game to keep it FOREVER. Thats not how it works. Not at all.
7054	0	a	laggy servers, tons of hackers, shtt devs, 3rd person shooter tactics are aids
8232	0	a	To be honest, I did not feel pulled into the game. The driving mechanics felt lazy and the things to do feel limited. Just my opinion and if you have the time try it, for you may have a completely different taste than me.
6126	0	a	This game is bad optimized and has a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring gameplay with 90% pay2win content.      I SPIT ON THIS CRAP
1890	1	a	Can't even believe I'm installing this again...
5618	0	a	No would help me. I couldnt complete missions and wasnt that good as a game.
8101	0	a	After 250 hours of grinding and acheiving gold rank the without shelling out $250 for a weapon, I was blown away (literaly) with the sheer pay to win game this has become. The players with the magic ability of excess money have access to the most overpowered and broken guns, abilities, vehicles, and gear imaginable. Trying to play this game as a free to play player is a death sentance. You will be massacred by premium weapons and peak level players who have unlocked every weapon and are free to unleash it on lower level characters who just finished the tutorial. It's very ironic, playing a cops and robbers game that espouses the concepts of justice and freedom, only to have financle shackles placed firmly on the wallets of the players.
4276	0	a	It's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ not even worth the money 0/999999999
9694	0	a	Got stuck on how to close the social screen for 15 minutes. When i finished the tutorial i got renamed from 'AnalCombustion' to 'Fiery Cupcake' because of some violation. 0/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
6776	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
10084	0	a	Probably the worst Post Apocalyptic Survival i have played. So much lag, graphics are completely terrible, i noticed a lot of hacking as well along with overpowered enemies and you have to put tons of money into the game to be able to get anything good. As of all the game is not worth it, it is a waste of time and space.  2/10 i would say to be honest, The game has achieved to be on steam and has gotten many players to play it. But everything is off on it completely. And also to add the website is off 80% of the time and so is the main server. (I have played for a whole day\24 hours and it still sucks â¥â¥â¥...)
10776	1	a	It's a great game if you're a dead rat
6575	0	a	Play only if you enjoy playing against cheaters and L.O.V.E unbalanced matches. Huge P2W fest.
4309	0	a	Don't get sucked in. It's garbage.
9962	1	a	This game has very good gameplay mechanics and does a very well job in defining a post-apocalyptic feel :)) definitely recommend this game.
3057	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
7713	0	a	this is â¥â¥â¥â¥. it runs in the background with no way to stop it which lags everything else out. it is classisfied by steam as running so you cannot play or delete it. DO YOURSELF A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FAVOR AND GET A DIFFERENT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME BEFORE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ UP YOUR COMPUTER PERMANENTLY
3832	0	a	First encounter with people in this game...hackers...I got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥...
6437	0	a	Outdated graphics, horrible gameplay and controls, when you connect its total chaos. just cause 2 Multiplayer is better.
3881	0	a	THE worse game i have played so far, you cant kill any other player....except for your teammates and enforcers who actually decide to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you, i played this game and redownloaded twice due to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ PCs and let me tell you It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ REASONS!: 1: your teams can choose and will probably do so: kill you for the sake of killing or to do the mission themselves 2: enforcers cant make easy money like criminals 3: aiming, shooting and killing machinics: SUCK!! 4: way too much like uberstrike with limit time using weaposn you have to buy....and re-buy....and RE-BUY 5: IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥!   worse game ever made 0 outta 10
839	1	a	Ok, this is my first review, but I will try my best.   APB:Reloaded. I dare think that, after several hundreds of gameplay, i still enjoy this game. It has some good and some bad sides, like any other game. First of all, it has a HUGE customization capacity: you can customize nearly everything of your character and car. Unfortunately, its matchmaking system is the biggest flaw. I am a gold threat player, and I am forced to play in Silver threat districts, for the gold ones are almost empty. Some p2w weapons surely exist, but they can be defeated with teamplay (it is a must: a good team is the most important thing) or with some excellent f2p weapons, like Colby PMG. So, if you can find a good team you enjoy playing with, this is one of the best f2p games I enjoyed so far. Anyway you should have a badass computer, and a relly good connection: expect lag if not. A whole lot of it.  Be ready for sad moments, but also for a lot of fun if you want to play apb. I hope my grammar was correct. Now the servers should be back online, so see you in the game!
5235	0	a	To me is the game not working
2503	1	a	get apb because u can mug black people
2742	1	a	Great MMO Grand Theft Auto style game.
2333	1	a	At first, I was a little sceptical about how good and fun this game would be. I've received various feedbacks from my friends about this game and not too many of those feedbacks got me interested in downloading this game.  Nevertheless, I thought to myself, 'I cannot make irrelevant assumptions based on peoples' opinions and perspectives.' And I've got to say I'm glad i downloaded APB Reloaded. I've been playing the game for well over 30 hours now. And i have seen some complains about hackers spoiling all the fun. Well from what i see, there are not many hackers. I rarely face any of them when i'm playing. The gun play might not be the best, but it surely is A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. And not to mention the ability to customize your character and vehicles. It is simply outstanding.  The only thing that bothers me about APBB is the driving. Well, i have always been experiencing 2 second delays when i hit the 'A' and 'D' buttons to turn left and right in my vehicle. That is pretty much the only thing i have to complain about. Besides that, i have no complains whatsoever.   So, if any of you guys are still pondering whether to download APB, pondeer no longer. It is a great Free-To-play game. The only thing you have to get used to is driving. It only takes a metter of time to practice a little and you'll be fine and dandy. DOWNLOAD APB!! IT IS AMAZING
3684	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play it. No really, Play it.
4564	0	a	Awesome concept terrible execution - be prepared for horrendous combat and vehicle mechanics with the only consolation being the in-depth customization of both personal vehicles and player avatars.
2120	1	a	it's good. for a free to play game.
5920	0	a	Don't bother with this game.  There may have been a time when this was a fun title back when it first came out. That ship has sadly set sail unfortunately.  Having played this game both before and after it hit steam, it hasn't made enough changes to the formula to really be worth your time unless you are looking for excuses to break your keyboard/PC in a fit of rage.  The teams for missions/combat are hopelessly unbalanced 4 times out of 5. With rookies/new players often taking up 3 of the 4 players while the other team is full of players with 800+ hours whom know every in and out of the maps. Whom have the best gear and customized vehicles and clothes money can buy (both with in game currency and microtransactions).  The vehicles handle like garbage. If you have even the slightest lag whilst playing this game may god have mercy on your car's steering, the game will not.  The ONLY reason I would suggest even remotely looking at this game is for it's customization. I have never seen a game that lets you get so detailed with everything from each article of clothing, to the decals on your car to even the soundtrack that plays for someone when you kill them.  -pi/10, would rather get in a fist-fight with pack of half-starved hyenas
2133	1	a	I don't know about any of you but I enjoy the game. I haven't found it repetative like others say, but whatever. I would give it 7/10. Just like almost all games, I want to get that one thing and when I finally get it I don't want to play it anymore. So you wait a while and then the game gets fun again.  Describe this game in one word: Co-op
9163	0	a	hi i tried this out and... yeah game isnt that good i tried it out the opening is WTF? story meh.... wait if eleena said i cant regenarate anymore then how the hell when i died i got back to life? and gameplay is OK its just like fallout but with bad story line worse gameplay unrealstic futurstic â¥â¥â¥â¥ game 3/10 seen better
2993	1	a	Its An Awesome Game , A Mix Of GTA And Some Other Random Game
453	1	a	The anti cheat system is garbage, the developers are terrible and cant keep promises, they are money hungy, its taken them years to do the most simple task AND not to mention they dont really have any live support or anything so if you need help asap i have bad news for you. HOWEVER if you can get over this frustraiton and endless waiting for simple things its a great game, you customise pretty much everything yourself to your own ability, making your own clothes is easy peasy if you have the tallent. id say %50 %50 . you have to kinda be patient with this game... for years
10207	0	a	Tried to ride a horse. But was then kicked by the admin for animal abuse... 2/2 best game ever, do get, do pay 200 dollars for premium, do play. REALISM.
1786	1	a	This game is fun but occasionally you get people that rage which is fine couse well... they mad.
10076	1	a	Good game features, great mmo, monsterious customization and crafting system.  Lacks a more fluid combat system.
7930	0	a	The plot is â¥â¥â¥â¥, because there isnt really one, and the servers never â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORK!
7887	0	a	This game is CRAP seriously i wasted 1090 hours on bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ the missons are the same , people are actually hacking , fairfight banning random people for being good and PAY TO FU=KING WIN is bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ its more like pay to lose and get banned
5511	0	a	Yea FAIRFIGHT whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo (Lets instal this antiCHEAT in all games) Redy BEND OVER get fuc c===3 ked HARD U have 2 options: 1) HACKERS ; 2) P2W players
1440	1	a	Hackers, russians and germans infested pay2win game.  Only play if you have nerves of steel or alot of money.
9569	0	a	this game sucks you need an account to that game to play it.
3271	1	a	Everyone has to try this game and experience what F2P GTA is like
2081	1	a	this game Rocks
2423	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
8145	0	a	This game requires that you downgrade your graphics drivers pretty heavily for the game to even launch at all. Sorry APB, but I'm not going back to 2011's geForce drivers just for you.
1446	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very intriguing game. APB Reloaded is like an open-world game to mess around. It is a cheap version of a GTA type game and can be fun when playing with friends and families.
1549	1	a	This game ruined my life. I love it.
6876	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
3052	1	a	Like FTP GTA, Hoping Rockstar will be able to do something like this one day.
3584	1	a	Cool
10244	1	a	Insidiously addictive. The Wild Wild West meets the Apocalypse.
6323	0	a	Let's be honest; it sucked to begin with and somehow has only gone downwards. Play at your own risk.
3714	1	a	its so bad its good
628	1	a	Pretty fun even though you have to deal with alot of lag sometimes. but it's free and fun to play in the creation screens for everything from tattoos to your cars and character
9570	0	a	I farmed vegetables for an hour and a half then used the money to buy a book that taught me how to make the first part of a pistol then farmed for an hour and a half to get the money to buy a book to learn to make the second part of the pistol and I repeated this several times. I then had to farm for several more hours to learn to actually MAKE the pistol, then I had to aquire the parts to MAKE the parts then I FINALLY made the pistol and the pistol sucked.    Also the combat sucks  So clunky  Takes forever to get crappy weapons.  Only way to get anywhere faster than traveling through space nowadays is to put money into buying money to get the book to- Yeah, you get the point. Don't play this game unless you want to spend hours on nothing. Or if you're rich or don't know how to save your money.
3739	1	a	It says the game is already running but the game is not running.How do I fix this issue?
4503	0	a	I would recommend you don't start playing this game in the first place. It has so many issues that never get resolved. They release the same thing over and over. Unfortunately I made the mistake and started playing it 3 years ago, now I am hooked. It's like an abusive relationship, you get tired of it and leave for a little bit, but end up coming back for more.
7072	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
4848	0	a	Game always freeze and also you need to be an admin account to start the launcher. Please fix this. I'll be happy if this will be fixed in the future.
3445	1	a	Ain't much worser than GTA online. 3/5
4514	0	a	Very few legit players left.  APB was one of the best games ever made. Sadly the company that purchased it Gamers First is one of the worst gaming companies out there. The issue with Gamers First is they have never had live anti cheat of any kind for APB. In turn this has allowed hackers to pretty much take over the game. During the past 2 years legit players have been leaving this game in masses due to the lack of working anti cheat. This game has been reduced to downloaded skills  I do not recommend this game for anyone that values legit gaming.
7321	0	a	Tons of character variety. Fun PvP.  Downside? Falls into the Pay to win category, which just isn't for me.
9424	0	a	my PC is decent and manages to run alot of games but this one... nope it doesent even run smoothly on lowest graphics
5629	0	a	As of July 2015 APB Reloaded is dead or very close. Matchmaking is near impossible as there is nobody to play with, at least on the gold servers which is annoying, most everyone only hangs out in the neutral district now :(
4058	0	a	Alright.  So, in a world where GTA V/GTA Online had not yet existed, Realtime Worlds (the creator of, among other things, Crackdown) decided to break the bank on an MMOFPS called All Points Bulletin, or APB.  It was a highly ambitious but deeply flawed experiment in open-world GTA-esque sandbox gamplay in multiplayer. There were a number of serious flaws to the game's design, implementation and operation that gave it pretty lousy reviews, and in the end it was one of the reasons why Realtime Worlds went into bankruptcy.  After this escapade, a holding company bought out the rights to IP ownership and services administration of APB, which would eventually become known as GamersFirst (a highly ironic title for a game company that seemingly throws everything they can get their hands on into a pay-to-win woodchipper as soon as possible).  These guys seemingly haven't done a whole lot else with the game besides random bugfixes that in the end might have made it impossible to play on my computer, either through the retail launcher or via Steam.  But when I WAS able to play it, there was a nugget of intrique buried in a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ issues that prevented me from enjoying the game as a new player. The anti-cheat system was terrible, allowing for way too many impossible snipe-shots from other players in free-roaming or in missions, the community was pretty awful except for those who often hung out in the social servers (thus giving me an opportunity to entertain them by dancing like an idiot a few times, what MMOFPS fun) and player advancement was really meager as a result of how stratified the playerbase's levels of experience were.  To be fair though, there are some positives. The character/vehicle customization engine was mind-blowing at the time and is still pretty impressive today. If you can get together with people you know, you might enjoy causing havoc knowing that police dispatching is wholly reliant on the number of Enforcer players on the server and vice versa -- in other words, the world swings from one extreme to the other, chaos or dystopian order. It's pretty entertaining in that regard, I guess, although it's just a side effect of how unbalanced the game is.   Lastly, the missions I could get into were pretty entertaining in the world provided -- one of my favorite things about Realtime Worlds' open world games was the environment they designed for them. I don't exactly know why I enjoyed them, as they could be rather generic at times, but they always felt alive to me for some reason.   Maybe if a whole lot was changed about the game I'd consider going back to it (once I could ACTUALLY go back to it, as well) but in the meantime I'd not recommend this mediocre excuse for a massively multiplayer GTA. Now that GTA Online's out for PC, I'd suggest you check that out instead, its flaws are much more forgivable. It's weird that I can actually say that and mean it.
5441	0	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥! Always has been. Always will be.

2848	1	a	Love this game. It's a nice twist on cops and robbers. The addition to being able to arrest criminals is awesome IMHO. If you're looking for a good Cops vs Robers kidna game this is it.   The only con I have with this game is that at times it will freeze and force you to restart your computer unless you disable all but one audio device.
4237	0	a	Kicked from server for just driving around and checking out the game. So, I can't realy give a proper review, however my feeling is that the game is somewhat hostile and immature.... lol.
3640	1	a	You're kidding me, only now then they add it on steam.
6472	0	a	One of the worst games you ll ever play. Its a pay2win game. Even though it tries not be it just cant. Its also one of the worst shooting games i ve ever played, because when you are in combat jumping around and running around will help you avoid bullets as well shooting while zig zaging around the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ place kill the oppoment. Snipers are not snipers, meaning that they dont even have a scope. its all 3rd person everybody! FU SNIPERS! Also the fact with cops vs criminals is one of the broken pieces of the game. 80 people max in a server. Every other server is empty. Did i forget to tell you that you rent guns? no? well you rend guns, cars , and lots of things that makes you baddass in this game for the max days of 10(atleast for guns i know of). I would rate the game 20/100 just because at first i had fun killing my other m8s because they killed me while investigating. I would recommend not getting involved with this game. Waste of time. IGN 10/10
2194	1	a	Its really good and Ienjoy it every single time I play it
7645	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior

10023	1	a	well let me start out with saying...  when i first tried to login it didn't work so yeah i used 2 hours to try and fix it.  then i went to the loading screen it took FOREVER. and the graphics looks like it was made in 2007 but the gameplay worked fine so i would say... 5/10 
9199	1	a	its great guys
5218	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the amount of Character/Vehicle customization.
3567	1	a	Absolute garbage.  This game is the tale of pay to win tryhards vs. trolls who do not give a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and with hundreds of customization options under your belt, trolling could never be easier. Nothing quite as satisfying as running over an anime pay2win roleplayer with your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car plastered with the image of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the hood.  It's fun to an extent but don't expect depth unless you've got hundreds to spend.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD
5936	0	a	This game is enjoyable, even with the latency issues and frequent hackuzations running around in district chat. I have played over 1,500 hours over several characters (I played since beta, when it wasn't on steam). I loved this game, I really did, but I can't recommend it.  First, the good, the things that just make it fun!  This game is fun! Open world gameplay PVP-ing against the opposing faction (you choose Enforcer or Criminal when you create your character).  Amazing customization. When I first started, I spent so long in character customization that I timed out. I've created some sweet mechanical-looking sleeve tatoos (I need to look mechanical/cybernetic somehow to keep up with my name). Vehicle customization is pretty decent as well. With parts you can buy for G1C and decals you can paint your ride with, you can create a unique ride that will stand out whenever you drive it around town.  Open world. The missions, though fairly repetetive after playing for a long time, are fun when you can come from many different streets or rooftops to attack the point. When not running missions, it's fun to hunt bounties that pop up (bounties are players who have attained level 5 notoriety/prestiege from completing objectives and killing opposing players).  But the reasons I can't recommend it?  Bad devs. Any game glitches, game breaking or not, are not fixed in a timely manner. At times, it will take weeks to fix even fairly small issues. Weapon balance issues are huge. They tweak the TTK for weapons, and now have a district just for testing out new adjustments, which is a good step forward. Despite this, they still have problems.  Bad mods. There are many, many 'fishy' players here, In my 1,500+ hours I have learned to distinguish legitimately good players from 'too good' players. Many blatant hackers which have stuck around for a long time, and have not yet been banned. Oh, and don't think you're safe from the mods even if you don't hack (or spend a fair amount of G1C-premium currency). I have had legitimate friends (who I can guarantee do not hack) be banned for 'hacking.' The support team does not listen, and will ignore your pleads for review.  The final.  If you do decide to play this game, I'd recommend remaining a completely free player, or buying very small amounts of G1C. Remembering that you can loose everything you've put into the game, even if you do nothing wrong. It's great fun with a group of 3 other friends, but you may get frustrated with running into blatant hackers when you want to just enjoy yourself.
3171	1	a	I didn't do a single mission. I just customize my character all day. 11/10
7990	0	a	I press start in launcher but the game not show up and my status show online again #WTF
9414	0	a	Wasted 30 minutes of my life playing this game. Bad sound effects bad controls bad graphics bad gameplay.
9107	1	a	I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, 'Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you.' That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.
7074	0	a	I downloaded the game and it would even let me play the game so I Uninstalled it and then redownloaded it and still wouldn't let me play it. DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!!!
6921	0	a	This game is an MMO. If that doesn't tell you what you should expect, probably stay away. If you like dying over and over again, this might be the game for you. I don't, which is why I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Frankly, this is not a review of the game so much as it is of the genre and the community. If you're the kind of person who can keep interest in this sort of thing long enough to get good, my review should mean nothing to you.  As for the rest? The people like me who joined too late/couldn't get the hang of it, and were thus deprived of all the fun this game had to offer? Well, if you're like me, you got interested in this based on style, color, and rampant, light-hearted brutality. You can find all that, plus a single-player or co-op environment that wants you to experience it, in the Saint's Row series. Saint's Row the Third and Saint's Row IV in particular are the closest to what I wanted out of APB. And go ahead and get the full package for the games as well, if you can. Having a tank right out of the tutorial sequence was EXTREMELY helpful and fun in 3.
9033	1	a	This game is great! The enemy told me everything I needed to know after forcing him to play this game!
6961	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
3597	1	a	this is a mix of gta. cod. and nfs. its amazing. the bad stuff about it is that it has bad graphics and {sometimes} poor matchmaking. also HAX EVERYWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EM' IS RUNNING ehem...where was i? oh.   yeah.   the market place has some dank player made stuff.  BUT the apb official marketplace [the gc one] is just overpriced. all the REAL DANK stuff is p2w. i did it. [duh] well its not OP but it gives you a slight advantage.
207	1	a	it sometimes does the thing where it's enjoyable.
5657	0	a	The game is not great, and the hackers in the early days ruined the experience for most, but in the end this was still one of the greatest role play experiences I have ever had. The customization options allow for true diversity as well, and if not for the money grab that G1 calls their Free 2 Play / Micro-transactions, this game would be one of the most impressive in history. Instead it falls flat, as was clearly evidenced by the complete lack of reception when RTW introduced it at E3 in 2010.
101	1	a	All Points Hackerchet: The Reckoning
5434	0	a	piece of crap in my opinion
8116	0	a	Fun Game, AWSOME Customization, sadly Pay2Win, and the community is terrible. If you buy items on the shop, for example, the clothing, if you create a new chatacter or the character you bought them on is lost then you would need to buy them again for another character, that goes for weapons and vehicles and everything else on the shop. Your wallet may need therepy, lots of therepy after trying to have fun with this game which means paying $20-$60 for one gun just for the community to call you a Pay2Win Noob. Even then to truely have fun you would need to pay for premium which costs $50 and thats only for half a year, then you gotta pay for clothing, weapons, and vehicles which compared to the F2P players is extremly unbalenced. Great game tho, but Toxic Community and the Company is powered by Greed. I mean, try it if you want, im not gonan stop you. It is 'free' after all. :3

1003	1	a	IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HATE IT ITS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LAGGY AND THERE ARE SO MANY HACKERS AND THEY JUST KEEP KILLING ME EVERYTIME I WALK OUT OF A SAFEHOUSE
9277	0	a	After waiting 26 minutes for the game to load and to create a character I got into the game, it immediatly crashed. So I reloaded. and it Immediatly crashed. So I reloaded again. And it immediatly crashed.  What I piece of garbage! No wonder its free. It doesnt work.
8913	0	a	The microtransactions are unbecoming. The community is mixed, some trolls some helpful, and the gm's, on average, are over zealous. I had some fun while playing, but making a purchase is the only reason it was playable. I have an acquaintence who RP's and they really enjoy the game and has made no purchases, however, they recieved the perks of males being nice to a female. While I know what it is now, and I wouldn't waste the space on my drive knowing what I know, I'd still suggest that if you're curious find out for yourself.  *Update: My characters have been deleted while that could be due to inactivity my g1c purchases are forever gone. Caveat emptor I found out about the missing characters when I logged in on my female acquaintance's PC.
4805	0	a	its honestly trash
9822	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
7304	0	a	Even the login 'feature' doesn't work. That's quite an achievement.  Unplayable, literally.
1528	1	a	This game is amazing!!!
525	1	a	My only qualm with this is the fact that the creators are genius. Their main draw is also their main source of income. Customization. Want to customize your car? Go for it. But you can't have more than X number of decal levels until you have a GOLD ACCOUNT. Want to customize your character? Of course you do, so go absolutely nuts. Right up until you decide to decorate their clothes specifically. GOLD ACCOUNT. How about your spray-tags? Weapons? Anything else? Same restrictions. It's evil genius.
10429	0	a	this game has alot going for it. it has good weapon design, a good character creation system, and a great concept but what this game suffers from the most is its bad controls and terrible combat system and the game really suffers from that, its difficult to get immersed when the controls are constantly working against you, but other than that its not 'too' bad and if you dont mind poor controls and iffy combat then id recommend it
1835	1	a	highley recommended even though my pc sucks at 1.9 GHz and a 256 MB graphics card i can still play with tons of lag and i love the game but please make a patch so it dont lag for me no more it gets annoying!
266	1	a	Best F2P shooter out there. Tons of content, and Micro Transactions aren't needed to survive.
2220	1	a	The bad:  -â¥â¥â¥â¥ Community {10% of the community is Fine {90% of hackers, kids, f*ckers (griefers, insulting you,tryhards etc..) It's at a point to prefer League of legends community than this ... mh ... nothing, just kill it.  -Bad matchmaking -Lag usually (servers are toasters, getting DDoS-ed sometimes and take years to be back) -Need Supercomp to run fine, and supercomp or not: Fps drops like dubstep : stand in front of a burning car = -30fps ~ -Anticheat is crappy, ban randomly: Freeban for everyone, legit or hackers, you spend 400$ in this game? Log in and see error 10008: Permabanned! -Armas marketplace (shop) is very expensive  The good:  -Awesome concept, sadly it's failing. -Freedom of custom (need premium in big part, so you must pay) -Events (50% are events to make you buy something) -Lol  [WARNING]  -Play this game kill your mood -You become aggressive -Be rich if you want something -People prefer pay a hack than buy something on it, or both. -Don't break your keyboard on it, it's useless
4938	0	a	When you think about character customization, you may think of some asian mmo... well wrong. No other mmo will give you that much pleasure form creating your own character.  Everything your character do is what you do and when you are owning the game, it feels good. Endless fight between enforcers and criminals is just briliant.  At the beginning everyone thought cheaters (coz they r no hackers) will destroy the game and you know hat? We were all wrong. Killing cheating noobs was fun, but(t) real stab in the back was delivered by GamersFirst.  From sexy game concept, they made dirty moneygrabing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's completely unbalanced, clunky, and it's PAY TO WIN and what GamersFirst did is unforgivable. It's a shame that they turned APB into pile of filth.  As much as I like this game, I can't recomend it. It should die and maybe after few years someone less greedy than them will remake it just as it should be.  Selling guns is killing this business, leave the game don;t download it let it die or maybe it will force GamersFirst to put gamers first for real.
3771	0	a	Review by a Long term Veteran of this game. From RTW(Retail, which I picked up at around July 2010) to Now and later.  (Excuse typo errors and any strange sentence combinations, fast typing and letters get mixed here and there and I really don't care enough after typing all of it to fix things) Deal with the fact I put a lot of time in the game, it just means my information is more backed then others.(oh man I'm boasting about it, now I'm uncredible)  Here we go.  Freemium! This game is heavily dependant on you paying for Premium to experience anything good, not like there's much to experience good cause really the only good thing about this game is the customization, but you need to unlock symbols (random mission reward that gets fewer and fewer the more you have) and the tutorial is terrible might I add so you'll get a lot of people making the experience that much more unpleasant.  Armas is a mess of Limited Time items(as of this review), far too many that it's laughable of how much content is limited time only and just recycled to fill in voids of no new content. With the new dev people, it seems that content is more frequent at points, but how long that can last till they just sit around and bank it up with limited time offers and resells? Who can say? It's all Pay for crap anyway, including items already in the game when it sank back in Retail like, goggles, desert scarfs and some others. The Uniform Jacket(Javez wears it and he's a criminal so there's no excuse) is still ENFORCER restricted for no good reason.  Server Performance(Not Client Framerate) Holy crap, the amount of problems you'll face is ridiculous, even the newer server hardware they're using isn't good at all for this type of game, you'll experience inconsistent handling with your car (due to handling being server side. Any spike, you will feel it and see cars smash into walls, people unable to control them as they exclaim in District chat 'Jesus take the wheel'. The amount of hitreg issues you'll face(taking into account IT IS hitscan, the ol I aim at this and the shot is instant) the slightest amount of spread on your weapon can really screw you over from how wonky the game takes the your information. You'll face many inconsistencies in fire fights that accuracy is blatantly thrown out the window witbh the issues and you're better off squeezing. **You'll see people using HVR Scouts and jump shotting with it (Pin point accuracy while doing so) to avoid certain problems with how bad detection can be.** They removed jumpshotting apparently from  vanilla  scouts.  Most people you will come to find out, will use full auto weapons(OCA, ACES, PMG, NTEC/CR5, Stock STARs and whatever new dumb gun there is) just to beat the awful hitscan system by firing as much as possible and not having the issues of shot registrations and bad bloom math from the game (ghost shots and magical bullets not hitting) I'll stop it there cause it's the biggest problem in the game(cause you're gonna have to deal with it to progress) and there's far too much to talk about relating to it but you can figure it out.  Framerate It's pretty on and off cause it's a bad version nof the Unreal Engine, your frames can drop for no reason so I'd suggest a FPS config even with decent hardware cause this game spits on it while not looking at all decent. They got rid of the pristine texture quality from RTW and a lot of the bloom to amke the game look more lively, to help 'performance'(I'm just gonna assume server load cause it hasn't done â¥â¥â¥â¥) AND lessen game size (which who the hell cares about 4-8 extra GBs anymore? There's games that are larger then this game and have less content in the grander scheme. More excuses.)  Gun Balance Gun Superiority here is a big thing, expect to see the same weapons over and over dominating. Full autos and high damage weapons rule over others and that's that, there's nothing interesting to the weapons at all, they all feel terrible(bad sounds, generic recoil) and with the server performance it's just not fun playing at all when you feel like you're hitting people with marshmallows, and you're gonna have to do a lot of things in action districts just to enjoy the best side to it which is..  ~Customization~ It's great but not without it's own issues. Certain features aren't there like snaping angles and what not so you're gonna be moving your mouse slightly back and forth to get that perfect position as well as ugly jagged outlines and darkened ones making masking over things difficult if you aren't using black to mask over brighter colors on a black background. (Makes sense when you start doing it, don't worry about how I tried to word it, you'll find out if you get into it) Texture projection is really bad, certain items can just cut off something on your shirt when overlaying it, causing ugly outlines. (Wearing a blazer/bomber jacket over a designed shirt) You HAVE to have Premium to enjoy customization cause there is a lot of restrictions if you want to make your own things. Use to be 5 layers free on clothing, and in CB they changed it to 3. â¥â¥â¥â¥ knows why. Tattoos are buggy, very...very... buggy. Some randomly duplicating, disappearing or just not layering properly. It's a nightmare once you're over 30 tattoos out of 50. You'll remove a tattoo, but it'll really remove something COMPLETELY different when you leave the kiosk, then you'll have to re-add it and it's just a never-ending nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of your tattoo designs in one go to avoid most issues if you start removing tattoos. You're gonna have to do missions to unlock most of the basic clothing you might like, and symbols (if you aren't buying them off armas.)  Armas Some weird â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up child of limited offers and high pricing. DO NOT buy weapons from Armas. NEVER do it, you can perform just as well with a stock weapon if you care enough to brave this game, and just to hopefulyl make them learn that pricing weapons that high(40-60 dollars sometimes) is stupid. Just stick to Premium, Clothes(they like doing stupid bundle â¥â¥â¥â¥, be wary that jacks the price up), and Cars if you are going to put money into this dying game  That's all I really wanna put down, I got a lot to put off my chest about this disappointing game that I thought was gonna be great back in 2010. Summary This game is terrible for a shooter, don't take it serious. Get points and if you lose, so what? You got standing and cash anyway, this isn't a game that has any rewarding skillful gameplay, you get your rewards and you progress to get what you want. Grindfest it up!  They tried to eliminate Idling the missions as much as possible, you'll have to do some work to get rewards, which means if you just get unlucky, and don't perform well, you might not even get anything cause that's how bad the system is.   The Community is a bunch of autism filled 4*channer kids who are all about the memes, that's all I really should put for those guys.  Have fun?... Or don't. I'll be in Social District for most of my APB time if I ever launch the game again.  I'd like to touch,  this is not a competitive shooter game . There are dumbasses actually doing clan scrims in a poorly done game. Team Fortress 2 deserves more of a competitive scene then this game.  TL;DR: Game isn't good and probably won't be further on. There's no direction in where it's going. Gun Play, grinding progression is not fun, and in which it's basically pushing you to buy Premium to even go at a decent pace, which late tier contracts are just insanely inflated and slow.  Example on Customization from a stream of me making someone an outfit -   Twitch is dumb and removes stuff that's months old.
10504	1	a	Fast, furious, lots of wepaons, skying, flying - if your like your FPS non-stop and frantic, this is for you. I personally love it though I suck at it... ;-)
3825	0	a	This game is owned by 'GamersFirst'(HAHAHHAHA, first?), *cough* I mean 'MoneyFirst'. This game is cancer, in it's most advanced form. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game , but I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate it at the same time. Armas Weapons &gt; every other weapon you can buy with in game curency.  Armas Weapons &gt; skill. Skill means nothing in this pile of crap. Get an Arams Weapon for Trial and I guarantee you , that you will wreck everyone that comes into your way. 'Bronze Server' is for Silver and Gold players, and 'Silver Server' is for Gold players. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 'GamersFirst' for the 'numerous' updates , for the award winning matchmacking system, and for balancing the districts for each ranks.
10560	1	a	Here is a revised summary of the below:  +F2P  +Fast game  +Excelent movement system  - somewhat pay to win  - people who pay will cream people who don't, so yeah pay to win  - the aim is the most f***ing slugish I have ever used. (I don't know if others have this problem or how   it can be fixed)  It's an excelent game but EXTREMELY hard to master the cross hair has a good deal of lagg with the mouse, with or without good ping I'd say this game is BETER THAN HALO (ce) IF they fix the aimer-mouse lagg get it while it's still free!  the following is just details of the game:  it's a first person shooter where you 'shoot em up' (in a nutshel) but it also has multipul gamemodes (about 6) and multipul charactars (9) each with multipul unlockable weapons (3-9) this game also an amazing movement system 3 different veihicles, tank, jet, low gravity bike + jetpack and 'ski' Ski is just going frictionless so you can acheive great speed downhill and use your jet pack up hill the tank is strait forward, high power excplosive shot with slow reload the jet has a high speed but can be stationary and fires lower power explosisves and the bike (my favorite) hovers above the ground and is the fastest thing in the entire game even minus the boost you can use! it allows you to go up hill pretty fast and then just glide off the other side covering emense distance in short period of time. there i so much more in the game asside from what I said so jst go for it!  45% (unless I can fix the aim thing, then 95%)
1200	1	a	great game but has its down sides like hackers an being called a hacker XD i dont know the 1st thing into hacking but on the plus side of things its free basicly like gta online but it was out before gta online altho there are gold menbers that kick â¥â¥â¥â¥ but its a good game

8867	0	a	don't do it. its a good game and i've loved it for years however the past 6 months it's died and there's not much point in anyone playing. there are bugs which damage the game greatly and have been known about for years - but never fixed.  The GM's / devs put very little time or effort into the game anymore and it's barely supported by them. The game has a crash or a downtime every day, but still the cash shop sales are pumped out. I feel they are just milking it for as much money as they can, when it's no longer worth anyones time - let alone cash.
5078	0	a	Worst game ever! Horrible gameplay, it's loading like forever and I could go on. Terrible experience.

4976	0	a	This is a bunch of P2W trash.  Pros : The concept. Wide variety of guns, Clothing, And accessories. Able to make your own gopnik, blin. Who doesn't want that?  Cons : Everything else.  All in all, This game is a piece of trash, That I had very high expectations for, From what one of my friends told me. Big mistake, My friend. Big mistake.
2920	1	a	Though the game suffers from some imbalances due to bad matchmaking and the arma marketplace, it's one of the best (if not best) third person shooter mmos out there. Take the time to get used to the weapons and driving and you'll love it.  7/10
8797	0	a	This game is pretty bad..!   Matchmaking almost none existant. Open Mics HUD / UI is bad not player friendly. For 16 years old and under ! The cummunity is horrible everyong just trash talks everyone.. Pay to Win --  The only good thing is rich customization of a charecter/Items.  Industrial/Cyberpunk Style game!
1824	1	a	One of the best, if not THE best free to play MMO out there, i enjoy this game A LOT.  I hear from a lot of people that this game is 'pay to win', you can't do good without paying... this is however wrong! you can do great at this game without paying a single dime, the first gun you start out with for example, is one of the best guns in the game, while not great in close quarters, it is awesome at medium range. All of the guns in the game has some weaknesses, find the weakness and USE IT!  You go out and do missions and after a while you get up to 100k-200k money, you can get a great car form the marketplace, the money takes some time to farm up, but it you don't spend it all on clothes or whatever it goes pretty fast.  this is a truly great game, for what it is.
5623	0	a	it sucks.
8587	0	a	Sadly I have to change my good review into a bad one. Once I defended this game, now I have to agree with every single person who says 'APB is â¥â¥â¥â¥!' it is impossible to defend this anymore.  So to add a little context here, I started APB on christmas of 2011 having just upgraded my PC, and I loved it. I would roll with friends taking down crims and enjoying the great sort of arcade feel to the combat and overall play of the game. I took breaks every now and again but I started to play more and more, sometimes playing nothing but APB all day. Come 2014 and I started to see and feel the problems with this game, the player base was dropping, more glitches were arising, stupid balance changes making some weapons boring or bad to use and no new content was being released.  2 years later here I am, trying to find a similar game to APB (in terms of how it plays) to replace it because APB is just not fun anymore. I still hop on it for a short time occasionally but that is mostly filled with frustration rather than fun. APB is a prime example of what happens to games when there are no other games to compete against. APB is pretty much a one of a kind, so the devs can get away with being idiots and people will still play.  By all means, try APB is you want, but do not expect much out of it.  TL;DR: APB used to be a fantastic game, now the devs have made it not fun.
1480	1	a	i havent played it yet
6438	0	a	This game could have been great if they got rid of the pay to win system. It has a fantastic character customization and average graphics but the god danged pay to win system comes to f*^*k up the game
10058	1	a	Free 2 Play and not a Pay 2 Win! The 'buy now' sticker can be moved off the screen by the way.  But yeah though, I had my fun with this game, it was actually pretty great up untill you start getting into Territory Control (TC) where the map is constantly ruled by the Travelers because nothing beats Dual Pistols simply because every disadvantage a pistol is supposed to have, simply doesn't exsist oh sure they argue 'Duh huh huh ammos expansive tho'  Not when you have 40+ Chip harvesters pumping out a constant line of red chips for you. Play the game but dont get into the PVP unless you want to use dual pistols.
1255	1	a	good a bit buggy but worth the while 9/10
929	1	a	best shooter game ever good quality and great graphics i really recommend getting this game
2614	1	a	A Nice Open world GTA Style game. Just get it play and enjoy!
10431	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. It is ugly, and has horrible gameplay.
3698	1	a	great game :D
253	1	a	I haven't seen any toxic players yet because i have only played 2 hours xD the game is pretty bad optimized and servers are laggy but its still fun
3403	1	a	Great game.... Alot of bugs and it's poorly optimized, we've been promised an engine upgrade for years now... still waiting  But the idea and concept of the game is the best i've ever seen.. (Y)
621	1	a	 I'm playing APB for years now, since the Open Beta. Don't be confused by my steam profile, I've played APB with the G1 client before, that's why Steam doesn't show my full amount of played hours.
3286	1	a	Customization is amazing.  Yes, the game is difficult. (learning curve 3steep)  No, there's no p2w.
6769	0	a	I can't even play it -.-, Can someone help?
1573	1	a	This is a amazing game. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes Gta 5 or wants a experience like Gta if they cant afford it.  Keep up the good work.
5444	0	a	can log on
9534	1	a	i give it a fish out of blurg  fish/blurg
2531	1	a	I recommend this game because of its free roam worlds and the way you can do things in this game, its just amazing. The only thing that i dont like about this game is that the launcher keeps redownloading everything for the game for me. pretty much what im saying is, fix the launcher or dont have a custom launcher at all. why dont you just launch it from steam? Well other than that the game is absolutley fun!
7514	0	a	One of the worst games on steam.
7685	0	a	never loads my people
177	1	a	i love this game
8540	0	a	I used to love this game when I didn't have many games to play, but after going back to it I have noticed how glitchy and also how extremely pay 2 win this game is. Also, it'd be wrong to call this game 'GTA online' but it has a lot of potential and I did enjoy this game a lot playing till midnight with mates on Skype.   But to sum it up, the game simply has reached a dead end, the playerbase is basically dead and the gliches and P2W aspects are just stupid.
8615	0	a	That's a Pay2Win game soo ...
8984	0	a	Bad graphics, terrible interface, wonky AI, weapons do not have the kick... Do not download it even though it is free, it is a waste of time.
8338	0	a	Punkbuster always kicks me. Horrible Security Right There.
3899	0	a	I really like how each person can be either a police or a criminal and complete certain tasks and missions TOGETHER! Unfortunately, not a lot of people play this game. I wouldn't recommend you this game unless you play with your friends. Playing alone with random people is pretty boring after a while.
1994	1	a	Love it, I hate it, but thats why this game is so much fun, you can be losing and the next moment TABLES ARE TURNED, GUN FIRE ALL OVER THE PLACE TEAMMATES BLOWING EACH OTHER UP AND YOUR SUDDENLY WINNING. WATCHOUT ITS A GARBAGE TRUCK READY TO GREIF YOU BADLY...   got carried away there for a moment, but thats how this game makes me feel. its too fun and addicting.  I give thumbs up cause I've been playing for a long while now :) and once you get far in ranking its really enjoyable  Pros: you can meet some pretty interesting people on here and teamwork is vital which is the success to this games team vs team  cons: needs to get rid of the bots and ghosters, and G1 needs to be more truthful and up to date with there releases... still waiting on the engine update.. :( otherwise this is my first longest review, hope you all enjoyed my input...
8926	0	a	outdated look, uninteresting combat, dialog sounds like its from the 90s. you are better off just playing fallout with mods.
10146	1	a	This game is pretty good but it is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. It is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t because you can download the game for mac on websites but not on steam.
8717	0	a	Complaint: On 2015-09-09, my Gamersfirst account was permanently suspended under the accusation of 'Hacking.' I sent in multiple support tickets asking for a legitimate investigation of my account and a chance for me to entirely explain what I was doing and what I was not doing. However, all of my tickets were closed with the generic copy and paste response that their system sends out when they refuse to be a respectable company and engage in a human conversation. Before my account was suspended, I had been an active member of the community for the game APB:Reloaded and had accumulated up to $2,000 spent for services and items for that game. Not only was I denied any legitimate customer support, I was personally lied to and falsely accused of 'Cheating' by the employee ***** ******' ********** who is the current Community Manager of the game. I was told that I would be allowed to 're-roll' by making a new Gamersfirst account and 'not cheating again' after multiple attempts at getting a human response from the company, however the account I made while I was waiting for any further responses was permanently suspended as well, without any justified reason. Afterwards, ****** personally blocked communications with me over the Steam service on which I had attempted to speak to her through, and not once has responded to any of my emails sent to her company email address. I did not cheat on any of my accounts at any point in time, and this employee personally interfered with any attempts at having my suspension being properly investigated. I had invested THOUSANDS of hours into their service, and had spent TWO THOUSAND dollars to make their service more enjoyable for myself and others, and I was disgustingly treated like I wasn't worth the time to communicate with.  Desired Settlement: At this point in time, it has been over seven months since my original account was suspended and I am no longer interested in having my account restored. I would absolutely demand the chance to personally be contacted either by phone or email by anyone who is capable of providing a human, unbiased conversation on the details of my original suspension, and to explain why I was allowed to be treated the way I was by the specific employee mentioned previously. In fact, I'll even accept a formal apology that I was falsely accused of cheating, and that my suspension was because I had been searching for unreleased content via the game's main executable. If either of these outcomes occurs, I will stop wasting the time of their game moderation team by no longer creating new accounts on a daily basis just so they have to search to remove me from their game repeatedly.  Business Response:  Thank you for contacting us. This account has been permanently terminated due to our staff verifying that it was involved in illegal in-game activities. As our Terms of Use  (www.gamersfirst.com/terms)  and EULA state, this is an explicit violation and necessitates account closure. We apologize such action is necessary and understand your frustration on this matter but we do take all levels of cheating quite and had to make the regrettable decision to close an account. Thank you for taking the time to submit communication through the BBB.  Consumer Response:  Better Business Bureau:  I have reviewed the response made by the business in reference to complaint ID ********, and have determined that this proposed action would not resolve my complaint. For your reference, details of the offer I reviewed appear below.  The response I was given was no different than a copy/pasted message provided when a customer contacts their customer support personally, which provided absolutely no functionally acceptable information on which to discuss this issue, though I appreciate the incomplete sentence about 'cheating.' They say that they don't provide information about bans because it can help cheaters avoid future bans, but in reality they do it because they can screw over paying customers and not provide legitimate proof of any illegal in-game activities. I did not cheat, and had not cheated, on any of my active GamersFirst accounts until they showed their true colors and I had nothing further to lose. I appreciate the effort of the BBB in their attempt at getting a reasonable excuse from this pathetic excuse of a company. ** *** **** ***** ** * ***** ******* *** ******** **** ** *** ****** ******  Regards, ******* *******

7856	0	a	IT EATS ANAL â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!! HACKERS!!!!! HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1723	1	a	It's a very amazing game, encourages you to try harder each time you finish a mission, but it's pretty annoying with the lag, the rendering issues, and the unbalanced weapons.
1045	1	a	Haven't even been able to start the garbo thing without screen flickering or facebook adverts. 11/10 best game ever once it's uninstalled.
450	1	a	Well to start. This game has so many cons yet too addicting.The Matchmaking system is broken and its almost unplayed for new players.I can say the community isent the best neither.In Missions your always getting out guned by R255 guys or What ever.The game pretty bad atm but still would give it a try. 9/11 
3716	1	a	For every good there is something bad in this game.  [+] The customization is amazing. This game is not pay to win. Events occur fairly often.  [-] THERE IS A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. The team behind this game almost always fails to deliver on their promises. We haven't seen a big update in over a year. Progression takes a long time. Dying player base.   Somehow, I constantly find myself coming back to play APB.
9007	1	a	This game is so pro i suddenly became a survivalist within 15 minutes
609	1	a	Steve is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥

7376	0	a	Okay, don't get me wrong here - the idea of a modern-city shooter with free-roaming missions and constant PvP is not bad at all. However, there are some serious problems with this game.  The fact that the vehicles have clunky controls I could stand. The way the missions are handled I could stand.  But the system requirements are absolutely RIDICULOUS. You basically need a top-end system to get any usable framerate out of this game. Any less, and you'll have 10-second pauses in any sort of loading - which is inexcusable with this type of gameplay.
10106	1	a	Its awesome, It has a sense of realism, and best of all, Its FREE.
6517	0	a	The game is VERY cool and funny, BUT it have 2 things that totally SUCKS:  -The matchking, u may play against players with LOTS of reputation ( levels ) more than you, i was 59 and i was matched against people with R 149, 229, etc, SUCKS!  -The weapons store, i have just 4 days playing and i have to play against people with more experience AND premium weapons, that means perfect damage, aiming, lots of bullets, etc, and they earn double exp and money than normal people, i understand its common you can buy premium isues BUT the difference between premium and normal is too high, the premium moddified weapons are so stupidly overpowered .   So, if you have money to buy premium stuff, welcome! enjoy it! but if you dont, dont even try this game, because ur only going to lose.
6221	0	a	It has great character customization and some great features but the gameplay itself is extremely repetitive and overun by hackers and P2W Players. This game is the definition of Pay to Win. It sickens me.
9228	0	a	I can't sign in. It just doesn't work. Don't know if this just is my fault or something wrong with the game. Looks like a good game but I can't make a certain justification on any gameplay as I have not yet experienced it.
5708	0	a	Matchmaking is very frustrating. (Two Silvers v. Two golds) Weapons feel unbalanced, and paying members are definitely the winners in this (Pay-to-win) Freemium game.
6934	0	a	Rank 53 without knowledge against Rank 198. Mission Matchmaking System 11/10. Even Tetris is more fun.
9227	1	a	Just gotta love the crafting system they have implemented in this game. Totally love it!
5914	0	a	i bought 20$ worth of premium and then the next day this update happens now when i click start nothing happens!!! i want my game to work or i want my money back!
3873	0	a	Overloaded cash-shop filth. The gameplay can be quite fun, but it's largely overshadowed by insanely bad matchmaking and purchaseable power. Would not recommend this game or anything that GamersFirst puts out.
7095	0	a	This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing suck â¥â¥â¥ it WILL NOT STOP â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RUNNING AND ITS MAKING ME LAG  
6010	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
9148	0	a	I don't write reviews...at all but the hell this game gave me for the first 20 minutes was pure HELL. First, i spawn in the clone room as usual and proceed with the tutorial. The problems started when i attempted to complete the first kill task, I start the fight to only notice there's no sound. No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the 'kill the sniper' objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers. I couldn't advance any further so I said â¥â¥â¥â¥ this (20 minutes or so later) and decided to write a review.
5282	0	a	Never, ever, speak with any GM or CM or you will get banned.  Met GM in game who was speedhacking and aimboting Went on highest roof avaliable, switched to auto-camp sniper, started my macro, put it on 45ms. Sniped â¥â¥â¥â¥er out of the world. Happily logged off, after calling him a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ing looser who cant win even with his cool aimbot'. Next day banned for cheats and insults aimed at other players.
4181	0	a	Played this game a lot, spent a lot of money on it, got banned for no reason and support wont help you get your account back if you do get banned for any reason. So if you are gonna play this game dont be good or youll get accused of hacks and get banned. Do not Recommend this game unless you wanna take the risk of getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ed over for no reason.
8576	0	a	I take â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that are better than this game...
4982	0	a	Best â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Game Prize 2016 Should be Given To This Game &lt;3
10486	1	a	Amazing game just had to uninstall because was unable to get dlc content
2425	1	a	Excellent Graphics, Interesting Concept, Hard to learn Gameplay. The gameplay for me is quite confusing and even after as much as I have played it, I mainly just get killed. I don't know if it just me but definitely give the game a try as it can be quite entertaining if you learn to play.
1930	1	a	
8741	0	a	Dont. Get. This. Game.  The servers are laggy, fps is out of this world, loading times are worse than skyrim, pay 2 win, banning people for cheating even though they wernt cheating. SHALL I GONE ON PUNKBUSTER? FIX YOU GOD DAMN GAME AND UNBAN ME FOR 'CHEATING'   Please just get Grand Theft Auto 5, you will have a much better 3rd person/first person experience that you will never forget.
789	1	a	one hell of a amazing game! it it a bit comfusing at the start but it will get easyer  they should have a ranking system so you cant get in as a noob and meeting a pro that has played over a year    9/10
8156	0	a	A great Game!!! But not really much fun for Free to Play People. There are to much Bonuses for others. Not well balanced. But the Gameplay and Concept is a Plus to look at it closer. Free to play Titel 6/10.
3160	1	a	I love this game and the fairness it provides to all players. Looking for a fun fair game with instant gameplay? This is it. It's like GTA V without limits. Play with me on the 'Colby' Server and be a criminal- my name is Drakonite; pm me!
10001	1	a	My Game is Stuck on Collating Data doesnt want to go past 3% . Anyone help me out with the problem?
7924	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator

465	1	a	Review written on 07/29/14:  I've been playing APB Reloaded since it was in Open Beta, back around late 2011. Since then, I've logged over 2,000 hours on my main character, who is a max rank gold, AgentRick (Enforcer, Joker East).  APB: Reloaded, like many other games, has it's ups and downs, but it's an extremely unique game that allows you to do so much more than any other game out there.  Let's look at customization first, since this is probably the most significant differentiator that APB: Reloaded has to offer. They have a detailed designer that allows you to make practically anything in-game utilizing tools and presets ranging from basic shapes, to gradients, and even masking tools to allow for cropping of symbols. If you're a premium player, you are able to customize your character and vehicle with unbelievable detail. My clan currently utilizes a Sheriff's Office theme and we have extremely detailed vehicles, uniforms, and logos.  Next, let's have a look at gameplay. The matchmaking system in place may not be the greatest at this current moment, but there is a visible effort on GamersFirst's part to tweak the matchmaking engine, and it's especially evident with the release of the Open Conflict districts. In comparison to Open Beta, the matchmaking system and the balance of mission objectives have come a long way. It's also evident that GamersFirst does focus on working out kinks in the system, as I personally worked with several GMs to eliminate the 'No-Witness-Zone' bug from the Waterfront Districts about a year ago.  Many people complain about the Armas Marketplace, but what they don't understand is that the Armas Marketplace, which allows you to purchase weapons, special clothing, special vehicles, and premium, is APB Reloadad's source of income. I have yet to see or hear an advertisement in APB: Reloaded from a real-world company that paid for it's logo to be placed in APB. (I have seen this in a number of other games)  The weapons that you can purchase in the Armas Marketplace, although some being unique and only available through Armas at this time, aren't very overpowered. Many people may not know this, but many of the Armas Weapons are simply permanent versions of existing weapons and reskins of existing weapons. Skill plays a MASSIVE role in APB: Reloaded, which many people fail to understand. Every weapon, Armas or not, has a specific purpose, some being more flexible than others.  If you are a brand new player, and don't purchase Armas Weapons right off the get-go, things may be slightly more difficult for you if you were to be put up against someone who has for instance. If you're willing to stick the hardship out for a short period of time, you'll find that you'll be unlocking weapons that are just as good, and as you develop your skills in the game, you'll learn tactics and gain proficiency with your favorite weapon(s).  I own an account-bound permanent weapon that people seem to complain about as being overpowered on a regular basis- the ACES Rifle. Although the ACES Rifle has a fast firing rate and decent range, it's not impossible to beat, as one of my own clanmates was able to take me down a number of times with his stock OCA. As I had mentioned above, APB is more of a skill-based game than anything, and typically whoever lands their shots, and lands the first shots, has a better chance at killing the other player, regardless of the weapon. Look at those (myself included) who have gone CQB with the PSR 'Harrier', (A reskin of the N-HVR 762) against someone using, say, an OCA. If I land my two shots before they land their 8 shots, they're dead. Thus, entering into the next section of this review, the community.  The community of players in APB: Reloaded are quite unique. You'll find that although there are a number of trolls and a quite a few sub-par players who will frequently smear and accuse good players of cheating, that you will meet some pretty nice people on APB. The troll and raging 12 year old population on APB isn't as significant as it is on games such as those from the Call of Duty series.  Being that I've logged over 2,000 hours on my primary character alone, I've seen quite a number of things happen in APB. I've also been accused of using some pretty ridiculous non-existent cheats in the game. (Such as increased weapon damage cheats, increased health cheats, etc.) Although this can be discouraging for skilled players, especially if/when you become questioned or reviewed by someone more important than a raging 12 year old, it certainly isn't a big enough deterrent not to play the game.  My biggest recommendations to any and all new players to APB are quite simple.  1) There are threat levels, identified by color. (Trainee/Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold) The APB Districts are segregated by threat level, and players can play in servers equal to, or one below their threat level. If you are silver, play in bronze districts. Due to the fact that people don't normally populate gold districts, you'll see a lot of golds in the silver districts.  2) If you have a friend who got you into the game, and they're a gold player, ask them to make a reroll account to help you in the beginning. Trust me, grouping with a gold player when you're brand new is being thrown right into the fire, and it will only frustrate you and make you want to quit the game. This again goes back to number one, play with or below your threat level in the beginning.  3) Understand that there have been people who have been playing this game for a very long time and have a lot of experience playing it. Don't assume that because someone is better than you (especially if you're new for goodness sakes) that they must be hacking. Everyone, myself included, has players that are better than them in APB. It's a fact of life- accept this fact, and you'll enjoy the game a lot more.  4) Join a clan!!! There are plenty of clans out there in APB: Reloaded. If you want to make the best of your game experience, join a clan! Find a group of people who you can play with, have fun with, and who can teach you the ropes. It's much easier to play with an organized group and you're more likely to win your missions if you do so. (Teamwork and Communication are MASSIVE force multipliers in APB: Reloaded, as they are in just about every game. A well-organized team of silvers can easily defeat a non-organized team of golds of equal rank.)  5) Know that you can do things other than playing missions! Although a lot of experienced gold players play in the Fight Clubs, Fight Club is a great way for players to hone their skills. It may not be the best learning option in the beginning, but I promise if you play Fight Club for a day straight once you've got the basics of the game down, you'll learn A LOT!  If you start to get upset with missions or fight club, go to social district and talk to people. There are a number of quite funny people who hang around social. If you're a criminal, why not try your hand at ramraiding? It can be both relaxing and rewarding. If you're new, and you decide to ramraid, go to a LOW population server (I'm talking the lowest possible population with the closest match to your threat level.)  Be creative! Mess around in the designers. Make some symbols or themes. Look on youtube for some tutorials on how to use the editors and hone your skills at designing. That can make you a nice amount of money, and it's always pretty cool to see someone randomly driving down the street in a car you designed and sold!  6) Have fun with the game! If you like it, help support the game by getting premium. Even if you were to only purchase premium once, you'd have the ability to fully customize your clothes and vehicles, and they'll stay that way when your premium runs out.  Although I've had ups and downs in APB over the years, I'd definitely say that APB is a game worth picking up and playing for a while. What do you have to lose?
8000	0	a	terrible game not worth even for free
1718	1	a	If you have money to spend great game. If you want a real free to play game then no.
3397	1	a	Tons of fun for a F2P game, the more friends you play with the better. Only drawbacks are the slightly awkward UI for shops and the time limit on weapons and Vehicles which you purchase but that is a downfall of the sales model.
4345	0	a	Extremely laggy, and is not recommended for weak computers.
3888	0	a	dont have money like me? the game become super hard!!!! play it if you pro most people has pay 2 play guns and stuff realy hard to win good luck.  pretty sad you must pay to customise clothes like a normal person  pretty sad you must pay to customise cars at all pretty sad you must pay to have 'Better' guns  this game pretty sad :/ i liked the idea but the pay to play ruined it :(  have money? go ahead and play it!
5517	0	a	Driving is sh*t, matching ising balanced, you have new players matched with players with full mods that its just a one sided fight
10316	0	a	This game actually sucks. I thought it would be really cool but ended up having a game-freezing bug every time a door opened. 1/10
5376	0	a	it doesnt load and it crashs alot
1525	1	a	A godd gta-i game its a fun TPS the costumazation is endless going from masks to tattos but a lot of cool features need premium acc whitch requires real invested money,there is no single player but the multiplayer ist that much laggy and the grapich are deccent for a free game.The controls are tricky but the options menu takes care of that.I would reccomend this game to any gta fan ,
8412	0	a	laggy servers, tons of hackers, shtt devs, 3rd person shooter tactics are aids
1305	1	a	I like this game. This game is for that people who haven't got money, because this is a f2p GTA, but this is a pay to WIN game. You can't buy premium (p2p) for pernament and without premium this game is bad for example: you can't customize your car and your charachter only 1 or 2 decals etc.
2654	1	a	Rather a lot of fun!
498	1	a	fix the severe lag issues and it would be a lot better n.n
10810	1	a	This game is great, as long as you dont mind a small player base and too be honest if it is that much of a problem, I would just give up and play GTA.
9400	0	a	IDFK what to say. Lets just say like all f2p games. I stop playing after a few days, but this game? Only lasted three hours before I said ' I am bored, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it time for Fallout 3.' Also don't even buy anything from this game, no. Just save that money and buy the entire Fallout series. You won't regret it. This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ online version of Fallout 1,2,3, and NV.
10769	1	a	epic is fast  10/10 ruber chikons

4176	0	a	I really want to like this game. Really, I do. But I can't help but feel that it doesn't want me to.  There is so much right with this game; customization, free-roam game play, thirperson shooter, all of which I like, but at the same time, so much wrong. Little has been added to the game in way of permenant additions, since the game has been acquired from realtime worlds. There have been seasonal events, sure, but other than that, not much else. 4 end game contacts a very long time ago, aside from that, the only regular updates are patches, to attempt to fix balance issues and performance issues and the whole lot, and to the infamous armas store (which is the game's premium shop where you can buy many things for real life monies.) I don't really agree with the way the game's premium shop works, and that's another major flaw to this game, for me. The community is just horrible. There is a clear lack of moderation in the chats and it is apparent as people often hold obscene coversations, or just spurt out vulgar comments to other players for no good reason. I'm not sure weather it's that the game attarcts the worst kind of people or rather it just brings out the worst in people, but there is just so much wrong here. Gameplay wise, the game is somewhat hit or miss. There are times where you can sit down and play and have a great time. Other times, not so much. There are alot of unbalanced aspects to gameplay that people will abuse just to gain a win. Weapons aren't at all balanced, there are clear 'good' and 'bad' weapons, which only further drags the game down.  I can go on and on with all the reasons I feel that this game is not worth playing, but in a way, I somewhat do reccomend the game to people. If you have a group of friends, this game may be for you, but to just anyone looking to play by themselves, I would recommend to stay away. I feel that I have fully experienced all this game has to offer me, and no, I do not recommend this game.
6442	0	a	boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and considering people can just bunny hop with smgs to kill me it's certainly unbalanced as hell.

2278	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
9317	0	a	Great game but unless you pay to play your character runs into xp level issues getting new quests in the 3rd region.  Also the melee based character is completely disadvantaged in many areas as the threat range for other NPC is within melee range, and they all have guns. So mnay quests can not be done ntil much higher levels (reduce threat ranges), thus less rewards (which are already reduced due to not playing to play).  The lack of players means it is hard to find teams to do some quests.

3774	0	a	To help you put things in perspective, I came from a VERY long hiatus. In fact, back then I played it outside of Steam before I did the 'change' over to Steam's installation. But now, in what I call a flurry of foolishness, I decided today to give the game another whack.  This is the point where you insert an audible 'sigh'.  APB: Reloaded, in it's early days, started off well enough. In fact, I'll go as far as to say I bought a shotgun from their Armas store (not even a great one...) which should be indicative of the hopes I had for it.  APB, simply put, pits you as either a Cop or a Crook. Crooks make money by commiting crimes such as crash-robbing store fronts, robbing pedestrians, doing missions... Well, their main source of income is mainly robbing storefronts. Crash a car in and get away with what pops out. Cops, well... All they can do is do missions or try and spot anyone committing a crime and then busting their chops for it. Any loot is returned to the evidence locker, which basically is as imbalanced as it sounds in terms of methods of profit.  In it's base concept, this sounds like a great idea for a game. The execution is fairly okay too, but there are some snags and other things that collectively ruin the game as a whole.  - I'm just going to kick in the door with the biggest sin: GamersFirst has a serious pest problem, in the shape of so-called 'Hackers'. Calling it Aimbotting is probably specific enough and self-explanatory. It was a pest when I left, and it was a pest within the first ten minutes of actual combat when I came back.  There's always going to be that controversial argument of 'maybe they're just really that good'. This might be a viable stance to take. But mind you, I've endured Aimbotting for an extended period in APB before I finally said goodbye to it. These Aimbotters may attempt to 'simulate' some more realistic response times. But let me tell you this: Back in those earlier days, I had someone admit he was using an Aimbot hack, which gave me a solid benchmark that allowed me to compare my previous experiences.  I have gotten a very solid impression of it, as well as an expertise to recognize Aimbotting and there was no doubt in my mind that in the brief period I played again, I was being subjected to it. GamersFirst has always claimed to come down hard on these things. But if they can't solve this problem within the two years that I left, then they seriously need to rethink of using a different anti-hack shield. Because it's the same one, and it really isn't working out for them. At this point, I even wonder if G1 cares anymore.  - The second controversial topic is the well-worn Pay-2-Win one. Funnily enough, if this game sins to this, it might be to a minor but still existing level. The Armas store has a range of special (and expensive) weapons for sale that for the most part have an improvement or exceptional trait over their regular counterpart. At first glance, these improvements seem minor. But when you get to know the 'standard' weapons, you'll understand that the improved version actually greatly counteracts the shortcomings the regular weapon has. For example, the SMG is a pretty great weapon that is only halted by it's short range. The equivalent that you can find in the Armas store has extended range. The changes are subtle and you won't really notice them until you are familiar with the weapon and have bothered to put 'two and two together'.  Not to mention that the Vehicles generally are very souped up in speed (even with a lot of weight in the car) and have either a series of useful mods installed or all mod slots unlocked. Either of which would require you to spend ginormous amounts of in-game currency AND level your character near maximum. If already possible with some vehicles.  - The 'normal' weaponry is a bit of a nuisance itself. More primarily in the way that you 'own' these. Now, APB isn't the first to 'rent' their guns and certainly won't be the last. But so far, this game is the only one that insists on only renting these for a set period of 10 days. No more, no less. You can't rent it for one day, or for one month. The only upside is that, in case of a rented weapon that has mods slotted in, you can simply 're-rent' it. Certainly isn't a redeeming factor, though.  - When it comes to missions, they will seem fine to the naked eye. Every 'mission' has a certain structure of stages to it. But the weakness in these lies in it's exploitations. There are two big examples of this.  Some missions end with a 'tug of war'. Everyone's position will show up in the HUD, and you need to constantly kill the opposing team's members to advance your 'pull'. Sadly, what has become common practise is that one team gets the advantage of even just 1 point, and then flees altogether. Going far enough so there is no way the opposing team can catch up and try and even the score. Allowing the aforementioned team to win by time-out. This is an extremely cheap way to gain victory and sadly has been practised by both Cops and Crooks. Especially since... well, if they'll do it, why shouldn't you?  The VIP ending is a touch worse. One member of one team becomes the 'VIP', which the opposing team has to assassinate. What common practice has become here is that there are set locations on the map where you can perfectly bunker down or 'camp' where the VIP can hide and all the defending team members have perfect defensive locations. Making it an impossible task for the opposing team to win.  These are exploits that have been around for quite some time. And while I skimmed the changelog of APB's update blog, I have no reason to believe this has changed. GamersFirst does not have a reputation of listening to it's playerbase.  - And as a final complaint... the fact that there's a serious lack of new content. The only difference I saw between now and two years ago is that every weapon now has a set of unlockable or purchaseable 'skins'. In fact, one of the other changes is a detriment. The 'Fight Club' serves are now locked to certain requirements, such as achieving rank in this and that. Funnily enough, I actually achieved these ranks long before I left APB, but apparently the game does not consider these as valid any more.   The bottom line is, APB is an IP that was bought over by GamersFirst to be turned into APB: Reloaded. It became Free To Play, but in return became a straight cash in through it's cash shop. Everything ties in with laying down more cash. Why just spend money in the Armas store if you can get a discount for being Premium? Why rent guns with in game currency if you can permanently have them for the price of three Indy Game titles!? (yes, the earlier mentioned shotgun actually set me back 12 Euros. The prices may have changed now, but that doesn't change much)  GamersFirst has one heck of a PR Team to make us believe that they are still actively developing this game and making significant updates. But realistically speaking, all this game updates anymore is the guarantee the Armas store works and you are still encouraged to buy some Premium time.  Please, I ask you: Don't play this game for a serious experience. And if you still play it, be it to have some stupid fun with friends (which is a perfectly viable reason), then don't purchase anything from the Cash Shop. The prices don't add up to what you'll receive, and it only helps fund this atrocity of a business plan behind this game.  If anything, it's slow death should only be hastened. Another great game, ruined by corporate greed and short-sightedness.
137	1	a	played it for a bit..it was fun

3727	1	a	Pretty steep learning curve. Pretty salty community. The costimization options a wicked!
4393	0	a	Buggy, laggy (due to other players) and EXTREAMLY unfair. Any one in the area can pick a fight with you, and most likely they are 50 levels or more above you, have far better weapons, or even worse have payed wepons. That and aim bots that they have still yet to stop, makes a game not worth any one's time. Shouldn't have released this without fixing all of that first. I don't trust it, and never will trust it. All the creators care about is how good it looks. LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING!

8547	0	a	This may have differed now, but when I played this game, the landscape was a barren wasteland with nobody in it. (Not literally a wasteland) Also, it was hard as hell to find things to do but roam around. Half the time you would just be getting shot by other players and they are way better than you, so you can't do anything about it. It is also a GTA Clone. And by Barren I meant there were no NPC's you could ever find 2.3/10 -Wasn't Very Fun

4774	0	a	its a bad game to play for people who like gta style type gaming because the game itself isn't realistic and gun aren't good too 
7241	0	a	It might say I only have 50 hours, but I mostly played without steam on another account. I played atleast 600 hours of APB in total.  Whatever you do, don't play this game. It's trash, such pay to win. The legendary weapons are way too overpowered and expensive, all the free weapons hardly match up and even if they do, they have been buffed with modifications which p2w weapons already have those. Gamers First doesn't fix any bugs in APB, this is the buggiest multiplayer game I have ever seen. They can't even fix the fighting club bug where it reverts your progress when you reach the gold place.  I kept saying to myself : - This game will get fixed one day, it will become even better.  I was wrong. I actually spent some cash on this game just to get banned 3 months later for.... for.... nothing. My account got a random block out of the blue. I wrote a ticket only to be greeted by a bot which simply stated that my account was banned for 3rd party application use. DOES â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SKYPE COUNT??! NO? THEN HOW IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I GOT A PERMA BAN? I am not the first one to be banned for absolutely nothing.   The worst part is that I lost the weapon I bought for over 40$...  The game it self has a great concept, but the company only wants money. Don't even get me started on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t events they do...  Overall, I don't recommend this game for : Poor customer service, in-game p2w shop, sloopy events, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ server/game maintenance, unfair bans.
5770	0	a	pay to play, laggy, crap. dont wast your time
536	1	a	This game is cancer, but i still love it! Dont play it if you dont have milions of dollars to spend.
391	1	a	its just like grand theft auto games but for people who cant buy grand theft auto so yes i love it
4109	0	a	This game is perfect for those who prefer driving controls like a speed boat on asphalt and a community similar to the likes of sociopathic dolphins.
2875	1	a	Awesome game. It's like GTA Free to Play... Neverending customizable options for your Character/Car/Music. Run through the City, fight for/against the Law, Spread the safety/terror. Shoot, steal or complete the randomly generated missions. Run up your rank/Prestige, buy weapons, cars and upgrade them. Definitely worth a try. Only problem were cheaters.. but that's from the time it wasn't on Steam and like almost 1 year back, I wonder how they solved that problem.

9801	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
10660	1	a	This game is fun! Its very fun actually! But Hi-Rez just left the game to die. They dont advertise it, so the fanbase slowly dies out because the servers are mostly empty!  They dont prevent you from having fun (although most of the content is locked away unless you grind your â¥â¥â¥ off or pay).   So yes, you should definitely play it(if only to know how a good shooter is done)

3522	1	a	TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it  Let me start by saying, my steam hours do not reflect my acutal playtime, I played many more times before this came out on steam.  This game is great with it's ups and downs, as most free to play are but overall, it's a very good game.  Let's start with some of the bad things so you can end off on a good note. It's hard playing at the beginning because you can get vehicles stolen that you are using to make your money (vans usually), the combat might seem pay to win because you are up against high level or high threat players with much better when you are low level/low threat due to glitchy matchmaking however this can be avoided in premade teams and you can always win against better guns even though it might seem hard, using even the start gun on a new character I can take on quite a few people. There are quite a few glitches and bugs but most free to play games have these and you get used to it pretty fast.  There are quite a few good things I could say but the one thing that really sticks out in everyway is the customization. Customization. Customization. You can customize every aspect of this. Your character, car, weapon and everything else is completely customizeable. Don't like your character look? Head on down to the social district and buy items made by other players or make your own. Hell I ran into iron man playing 'I am Iron Man' and during any of the parts there weren't any lyrics he would scream 'I AM IRONMAN!' The community is great while at the same time very toxic depending on who it is. You can also customize your car. Pick your type of car, choose a color and make graphics or buy graphics to put onto your car and enjoy. One of my favorite points of customization for this game is how you can upload your own songs and play them while ingame in your car and people outside your car who have not downloaded the song onto their computer can hear your car. Customization is one of the biggest parts of this game which make it appealing but overall the game is fun to play in most ways where you can enjoy yourself and have fun.  TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it
10787	1	a	Go fast.
7802	0	a	Quite possibly the most hostile, arrogant and rude player base of any game I have ever played. That alone is enough never to play this game for me.  Besides the player base, the game has very little content. It's all PvP missions and with the low server populations, there aren't that many people that play so the world feels very empty.  Then there are the rampant cheaters with aimbots, etc. The developers are doing their best to combat it, but you can see messages from FairFight banning people every few minutes. That is very telling that there are so many when the server population is maybe 50 people or so.
7049	0	a	It's hard to call that playing as it kept shutting down. Buggy.

5706	0	a	Pay to win. To many overpowered items and features for people who spill out hundreds of dollars into this game. Was really fun at first but then it got very repetitive.
146	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends. APB is quite a lot of fun with a lot of friends and you just mess around the entire time  -Gameplay. Even though many people find it repititive i still found it quite enjoyable to play and I think have logged something like 200/300 hours into this game.   Cons: -Terrible servers -Terrible developers  - Hackers. Hackers everywhere.
4324	0	a	Possibly one of the worst communities I have ever experienced in a game. The general population of the servers expect you to know every aspect of the game before you even create your first toon and are unforgiving as you undertake the steep learning curve. I know I am not an elite player, but with time I am sure I could get the gist and hold my own in this 3rd person shooter, but the constantly being kicked out of groups moments before the final stage of a mission just shatters any illusion of enjoyment.  As an Australian player I already have to deal with a 200+ ping and in any pvp environment that will create problems but the lack of understanding/empathy from the APB community seals the deal for me. I will take my money elsewhere, I am sure there are many other 3rd person shooters that have an active friendly community. If this is how the game is currently running I don't really see a future for it as new players will be crushed by the overwhelming amount of arrogant, immature elitists.

Now it's just rotting AND crippled.  Sure, you can dress your zombie horse up however you want. Give it a little hat. Try to pretend it's alive and well. But the truth remains; It's not. Every moment it exists is a plea to stop its unending torment.

8884	0	a	Fallen Earth is a post-apocalyptic game with sci-fi technology. It was released September 22, 2009 and with that said... Making a game with let's just go with a major title, CoD or Battlefield like graphics...It'd need a engine to process it and this is a game already finished. So the graphics are dated, even at it's highest setting can look like a mudded mess.  You know what, no, no, I wanted to be a bit nice to this game. Look at my screenshots. The mane of my horse, a free mount is beyond s***. Hell my shadow while in first person is cut in half at the waist, and there's no first person animations what so ever. There are in third, but that is just horrid. If that isn't bad enough you get spells and skills like in World of Warcraft..I'm playing at max settings mind you. There are no animations, effects, nothing like that for anything you use in first person. So I don't know if I'm using a poison spell or a spell that s***s f***ing rainbows. Should I mention if I try to heal while in combat that I'll actually heal my enemy? WHAT!?! Oh yes, you have to TARGET yourself to HEAL yourself.  This game is a hardcore knock off of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The graphics are the same if not worse then both, huge lack of animations, glitches, and just awful, dreadfully poor, sloppy and LAZY design work. If that doesn't p*** you off then what about the fact you have to swap from mouse to aim every 2 minutes to click on a quest, item, object, whatever it be..Ending tutorials, etc.. Oh your mouse cursor is what they use as the game cursor. That's just f***ing pathetic work.   Another fun thing is crafting, and timers. They haven't yet, but I'm damn sure a single timer can easily eventually be an hour if not longer. By the way you can only craft ONE, ONE ITEM AT A TIME IF you do not buy their stupid VIP. Want more, I've yet to go into PvP and frankly I don't think I want to with the other reviews I've read. Already see paid content is able to move ridiculously faster, and it seems at best if you don't pay for the game you're getting a horse. My mind is just blown. That's just mounts/vehicles...What about these keys and boxes and crap that give amazing gear you CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE?! No. Just no. It figures, any title under 'GamersFirst' is nothing but a pryamid scheme for your money. I'm dead serious too, look at APB: Reloaded and APB.  Oh and the learning curve on this game might as well be a f***ing mountain flying in the air. If it wasn't for having looked at my keybinds, and even then I'd be having difficulty as hell. Don't forget, no animations, effects, etc. with most spells/skills/s***s/f***s I don't give about! The game is about you though and the other 20 or so people around, you died at the Hoover Dam and now you're a clone. Should I mention everyone here and everywhere else f***ing hates clones? You might as well be a Jew in NAZI Germany. Question, what game allows jumping that can't allow turning while in mid-air? Answer, Fallen Earth. S*** YOU NOT. The map could be really big, the thing is though... I DON'T HAVE THE F***ING ABILITY TO SCROLL AROUND THE MAP.  3/10 I will never recommend playing this game, even to see if it's really that bad. It's worse.
1381	1	a	i need an understanding of this game.. i just dont get it , but its addicting ,i have fun and frustraion while playing it for hours at a time..
1293	1	a	This is an awesome MMO Sandbox game. But the open world could have been better and the vehicle handling is just awfull. There are a lot of glitches that needs to be fixed. The graphics are good. As its free to play i recommend it.

8307	0	a	got no play time on this due to me playing APB without steam up.. I have 1000 hours gameplay over 3 years and yet no improvments just gets worse and worse with every 'promise' that they will update the servers, ban hackers, update the game and even just make it fun like it used to be but nope, nothing. Servers havent been updated in years, hackers are everywhere and can just re-roll.. this means that they just make a new account and then start playing again.. it isn't fun anymore, all games are one sided, all guns are only good in certain areas and you have to change so fast to adapt to the game area where the objective is and in some games you switch your weapon and its already changed again because you've been put against 5 maxed rank players and you have low ranks that are all under 50 that have no clue.   Other games can be you with max ranks against low ranks that are all gold threat (highest threat in game) which are very 'dodgy' to begin with even though making a new character keeps the same threat, for example you could have a max rank enforcer then make a new criminal account and yet at rank 1 it will share the same threat level, which would be gold for example. This would be fair enough but now-a-days its an obvious way of seeing if they're not legit. Most are hackers now-a-days even with 'fairfight' which does nothing, they will hack a few games and by the time they get reported they've gone offline and cannot be checked at. Also makes it fun when you can even get into a game with a developer and yet they still hack! you cant even message the developer dirrectly due to not being able too which is always great! :)   Developers are just money hungry, 'new' weapons aren't 'new' they are simply re-skins of other guns that you can get if you want to try and grind against hackers to buy the guns which are for 7 days only and by then you dont usually make enough to get back to cover what you spent on the gun.. It may be F2P but it is certainly P2W now.. Dont bother, games been going down the toilet for the last couple of years and now they've milked enough to bring it to consoles for more mugs to 'play' until its hacked there. Avoid it.. Dev's are useless money grabbers who do not care for the game only for the paycheck at the end of the month.
1119	1	a	I love this game, It's addicting and fun, and I met alot of awesome people because of it.
3487	1	a	how do you get to play the game!? 
8408	0	a	While before I have gave this game a good rating, urging players to just give it a try. Well, that was back when the community was still pretty decent.   I base this review on my new experience, starting brand new character instead of playing as my old one.  Now, the community is just toxic. While I didn't notice any hacking of late, also did not get much time as people are quick to isolate and force out the 'noob', as I did not have easy access to good weapons when first starting. It is this kind of behavior that sickens me and will cause this games death as new players are instantly deterred and old players will simply stop playing.   Other than that, same as before, customization is in depth, still far beyond any other MMO I have tried. The driving mechanics feel like you are driving on ice though. And it is incredibly annoying, popping up my browser to open the store every time i switch districts.  I would not reccomend this to anyone anymore, which is tragic as me and my friends used to have a blast. Sorry, APB, it is time to move on.
4989	0	a	there are boters on this game it sucks
5257	0	a	  I tried to like this game, but the many flaws keep holding back what COULD be a good game.  Pros:  1.) The customization is pretty good. 2.) Respectable weapon choice 3.) Interesting concept. 4.) Decent controls.  Cons: 1.) Incredibly short draw distance, which leads to players being invisible until they pop up a few feet in front of you. It makes using the many weapons the game offers incredibly worthless. 2.) Horrible community, oftentimes there are hackers, aimbots, insults and fighting in the game, and due to the friendly fire, you may end up fighting amongst the 'group' more than fighting the enemy.  3.) Zero strategy. Though most of the matches I played, the main tactic for eleminating other players came down to doing 1 of 2 things. A: get in a car and drive right up to your enemy, (since any vehicle makes the player immune to damage) hop out at the last second and 1-2 shot them with your shotgun. or B: use a 'marksman' rifle type weapon.  4.) Level imbalance. As with any RPG-ish game, you'd expect to find some advantage with being a higher level, but run into someone that has an upgraded vehicle, and you'll never be able to take them, or their vehicle out, as it soaks up grenades and sniper rounds left and right. Expect to get killed in almost every fight with someone that has any sort of upgraded gun as the basic weapons don't offer any sort of real protection against the later upgraded weapons.  5.) The game itself, tells you nothing, nor does it allow for any sort of play outside of PvP, not even a decent tutorial to familarize yourself with it's 'complex' gameplay mechanics.   I could go on, and I should, but frankly, this game is not worth wasting your time on. The few problems I mentioned above hold this game back so much, but from what the current condition of the game leads me to believe is, we'll never see any sort of patch, update, or intervention on these issues.
7277	0	a	A fairly interesting experiment in human psychology reminiscent of pavlov's dog. An element of chaos was added to test whether or not humans prone addictive stimulus; were capable of forming long term habitual indulgence if they were not guaranteed a reward. This, of course, plays off the humanity's love of 'gambling'. Indeed, other forms of pure gambling are present as well to to give more conclusive results. In addition, Gamersfirst has chosen over the years to stimulate enviromental changes in the form of 'weapon balance' to see if the addictive qualities of the 'game' will hold up under stress.  With no set end date, and the experiment soon to branch out further in scope. I eagerly look forward to the results of Gamerfirst findings. With rigorous testing protocols and such a large sample size. This is surely the most in depth study of the human psyche regarding habitual gambling.  Or hey maybe it's just a poorly managed game by a company looking to make a quick buck while taking four years to develop anything of substance. This game honestly doesn't deserve this kind of abuse, hopefully it'll be put out of it's misery soon.
1343	1	a	Great Game
5155	0	a	this game is frustrating because for some reason i cannot close it
9431	1	a	To anyone who enjoys a gritty post-apocalyptic world with a detailed crafting system, yet doesn't mind a slightly clunky, aging interface - I would suggest they at least give it a few hours.
9251	1	a	Its alright, i guess.
95	1	a	Game aint dead, still worth hoping on not pay to win, just whiny noobs claiming it is.
6630	0	a	APB:reloaded.... i simply dont like this game, everything, EXACTLY everithing MUST BE PAY2WIN, also the missions are bad. this is my personal opinion btw... if you like open world but hate p2w (pay2win) then simply dont download this game.
2565	1	a	Most of the time it wont work
4352	0	a	Now you can play as a SS Soldier and still be a good cop
5266	0	a	Broken matchmaking, pay2win, hitboxes are joke, missions are grindfest, no actual freedom to do anything else besides just drive around.
5704	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing masturbing because when you enter to game is a black screen and never is a good game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing games on steam
4331	0	a	great game! great customization, very fun  1) pay2win -3,0 2) terrible optimization -2,0 (you will need to buy a computer directly from nasa to play this, and you may still get lowfps)  my opinion: VOTE 5.0/10
4182	0	a	I just want to say this game is perfect example have Pay To Win in Free to Play can make game worst..... Game is soooo good for about 10hrs but after that you can see and get in lobby guys what have a lot of payed stuff and that is really bad becouse it gives them a lot of boost and advantage.. You can see how game is set around Pay To Win becouse every time you start game it shows you shop with stuff for reall money... Its really good game but only if you buy in game items for reall money.... Gamersfirst Fix this ....
8097	0	a	this game isnt that good i mean i went on to the enforcer side and people were talking about being horny and being nude in skype calls
4155	0	a	Only pro is the unparalleled customization that so far no MMO has beaten.  Cons include hackers, pay2win extremity, hackusations, trash community, â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor optimization, bad matchmaking, repetitive missions, utter grindfest.
8201	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
4521	0	a	This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.
4359	0	a	After much more time on this game I can neither recommend or say no to it.   IF you're looking to just kill time and â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with friends this is for you.  If you're looking for a deep competitive f2p shooter with no p2w aspects and a long lifespan this isn't for you.  Presently APB is really not that great. There are many problems with the game and it really will make your experience terrible. First the grinding is ridicolous. It doesn't matter that you can get money as a criminal by raiding for money, or just mugging, it takes a really long time to get cash still and you run the risk of losing it all. If you're an enforcer you really can only make cash by doing missions and that's all. Premium gives you and extra 3rd Premium cash bonus and it helps a bunch. Instead of playing for 5 days to get like 150k you can only play for just 3 if you are getting top of the leaderboard each time.  Gameplay wise, it's fun. Guns all have different feelings to them and the game encourages you to use different tactics to approach situations. Teamwork is also recommended but generally be good at game strats and you can win. Sadly this game is terribly unbalanced. Guns have been getting changed constantly and some of the high end ARMAS weapons which require real money are sometimes better than the default weapons you can get by just playing and the claims about this not being true are mostly from rabid APB fans who have played the game for years and will defend anything the dev does.   Customization is fantastic and is really varied but you can't do much without premium. You get about 3 whole layers of customization for clothing and 6 for cars and that's all. With premium you get like 50 for both and it's honestly a joke. Premium isn't worth just this but the problem is if you get say a week of premium and you make this awesome looking piece of clothing, dont try to change it or fix it after that week because you wont be able to wear that piece of clothing unless you take off all the excess layers sadly. Premium is very badly done and the game has absolutely no incentives to have it other than less money grind and better customization.  Optimization is frankly AWFUL. I use a pretty medium-high end PC and I can get 60+fps on most games but this game is terrible optimization wise. I'm getting 40-50 frames and worse when big fights are happening. I'm fine with 30FPS but when it's a fast shooter like this, it's very unnatural to have framerate that constantly changes. They promised an engine change but that is unknown to when it'll be released.  Community is also legit terrible. It's full of a bunch of APB elitist who defend the game no matter what happens. Say one bad thing and you're attacked by a bunch of children who try to defend this 'perfect game' calling you a moron and to stop crying.  Frankly this game is not worth it if you want to play on and off. You won't get much from the game if you play like that as it requires constant grinding for money to get better gear, and ranking up to Rank 255 frankly is a nightmare unless you play for straight hours on end. Playing this game free is alright. It's not as bad as other games but it takes a lot of time to gain money like I said, and with a community that is toxic, bad balancing, and other issues on hand this game isn't really worth your time if you want to play just for fun.
3557	1	a	Third person shooty shooty with vehicles in a big city, so imagine GTA Online but with random missions popping up.
1876	1	a	One of the best 3rd person arcade shooters out there.  Loaded with customization options, some may suggest it's P2W, but the game is largely skill based. General car controls are a bit iffy, but are manageable. Character controls are responsive.  Community is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ and look down upon newcomers, the developers are slow. And the game likes to chew up to 4 or 5 GB of your RAM.  Despite all of it's issues, it's a solid game, and deserves a go, it's one of a kind game.
4659	0	a	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥, THATS DOOKIE WITH A SIDE OF KAKA UNINSTALL
8180	0	a	If you love COD or anything like it and can get down with customizing , this is the game for you.  That being said, i can't stand this game anymore. The set up is awesome, the customization is awesome, the map lay outs are detailed and super expansive. But the matching system is broken. As a newbie you can easily find yourself up against the best of the game right from the start. There are servers dedicated to different player ranks but it hardly matters. The gun you start out with is an ar that might as well be a airsoft. when your enemy comes at you with a bazooka. While the developers have done what they can to make this game fair for everyone they really over looked certain aspects.  Hit boxes are a joke, there are no critcal hit (headshot) areas, your just one big block. oh and even if your character is small, your hit box is still the same size as if you made the largest possible character.  the weapons in the game are exspansive, and while you can TECHNICALLY get any gun that anyone else has, it requires some serious dedication to unlock them all, let alone rent them&lt; (yes RENT) but even then someone always seems to have a better gun than you some how, and with no way of knowing what others are using, good luck guessing what to aim for. Speaking of aim, recoil is HEAVY in this game. sure might make it realistic but when it destorys the point of a weapon. for instance, loads of sniper rifles in this game, problem? none of them are 1 hit kill (which is obviously an attempt to balance the game) but the recoil on them is so heavy you will never get your second killing shot off in time to get your target unless they are inexperianced (which is rare) as such SR are rarly used. the most common gun use you will see are assult rifles, light machine guns, and anything explosive. any other gun is a waste of your time , and of course those are some of the hardest weapons to get the best of. my main beef with this game is the combat, simply from being completly out classed as a new player with no way to train up and become better except to be fodder for everyone else and lose match after match. however i must also state, the driving controls are pretty wonky as well, very easy to flip over your car from taking a slightly too tight turn. Enemies also make heavy use of the slightly broken vehical issues. like being able to blow up your car, with you in it, to get that 1 hit kill. or hiding key items in a spawned car that you cant access and waiting for the timer to tick away. its a pretty low tactic but one that works so well, its common. the last thing i will say is there is a prestige/notority system thats in place. once someone reaches 5 stars on either a bounty is placed on them and the entire other faction can kill them, or at least can try. Which when the 5 star person decides to storm the noob tuturial spawn point there is no one there strong enough or quick enough to stop them and they slaughter every enemy in sight! as they can also kill everyone on the other faction as well. i spent a good 5 minutes dealing with that till one of my factions stronger players came along and put them down. while this game has many makings of fun times, the imbalance issues are just too much for me to over look. and seeing as this game from release is 3 years old, i dont think things will be changing much.

4606	0	a	The idea of this game is really good, but the problem is that the developers are greedy and they are liars. Promised engine update in the begining of 2014 and it's now the end of 2015 and still no update. Instead they push out useless guns that are only reskins of FREE weapons (except legendary weapons) and they are concentrated on pushing even more of that stuff. The old players lost hope for this game and this game is dying slow since the devs don't want to actually do something about the outdated graphics and the game engine. The servers are sometimes laggy (atleast for me I think) and the community is the worst. If you win a mission and you do good you get spammed with private messages about you being a hacker.  But there are some good things also. There are almost no limitations in customizing your character, vehicles, clothes. You can create you own music and 5 second themes which are played to the person after you killed him in a mission.  I hope the devs fix this game and stop the useless or sometimes extremely overpowered weapon flood in the ARMAS marketplace.   I wouldn't recommend this game because it has too much flaws because the devs ruined the game and the game is not fun anymore. Would recommend GTA 5 instead of this game although it lacks customization elements.  I hope my review helped.
5500	0	a	As of July 2015 APB Reloaded is dead or very close. Matchmaking is near impossible as there is nobody to play with, at least on the gold servers which is annoying, most everyone only hangs out in the neutral district now :(
983	1	a	okay, so, i dont have many hours but i will say this, it is a hit or miss game with the public so here is a list of pros and cons as of 2/23/2016 pros: the community is alot better now that bans have been handed down over waves and such, the graphics are great for a free to play and game play is simple to learn but hard to master considerably less hackers, still out there, but i see at least five banned every day by this new system 'fair fight' awsome custom jobs and such, and amazing artwork in and out of game, and awsome player made clothing and charectars to boot, (yes, even enforcers love the way some crims stylise  now that the pros are over, he are some cons  1. hackers, still, not as much, but still there 2. PAY TO WIN, gamers first prides themselves on allowing people to have a amazing fun time, even when your loosing, but 'why is this a con?' i hear you ask? because gamers first, like any other company, like jagex and blizzard, loooooooooooooooooooooooooove money, gamers first is just a bit more open about it, they cater to the rich with awsome cars and weapons, that to have them permantly, you have to pay around 20-30$ usd to buy, and in this game, they almost force you to buy them with irl cash, which brings me onto number 3. 3. expiring weapons, after 7-10 days, your weapon you bought from your contacts is unusable, no reason why, just it, if you ever wanna have a good perm gun, your gonna need to fork over some cash. 4. community moderation, No, i dont mean 'oh admin where are you, this guy is hacking' moderation, i mean fourm moderation, gamers first doesnt really have that great of a customer service really, just a few copy and pasted anwsers most of the time, but hell, most game comapny's do this,  so, in the end, my rating would be. 7/10
2448	1	a	Honestly gta 1 was better than this.
6038	0	a	Whatever you're thinking of doing with your life...Searching through free games or any other kind of games...Install ANY but not this game...This game has officially been overrun by hackers, it was once a good game (2010-2013) but now it's dead to me deep inside...DONT INSTALL THIS GAME.
9187	1	a	best game evea but kinda like a double of fallout  
6201	0	a	I cannot even make it play
2741	1	a	this game reminds me of saints row 2 the best one 8/10
2441	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
7090	0	a	Plagued by an awful dev, horrid community, and no resemblance of a fair match making system, this is a game that is aimed to appeal to whales and grade A try-hards. There is no in between.  I finially quit today after giving it an honest effort. My performance was not bad, but i can draw no joy from this toxic community. Too many missions lost because the entire team has grenade launchers but no one they're fighting is even half way done progressing towards them. Too many high skill rating players in low skill districts. Too many max rank players farming noobs. Its disgusting, and G1 does nothing to stop it.
2237	1	a	Man, what can I say? I'm basically playing my character from San Andreas, busted out of Federal Prison after 10 years!   Different city, sure. But the street feel is familiar. High nostalgia hit for the violent 300lb homie covered in badly spelled jail tattoos. MO Cops and Robbers. Ultraviolent roadrage incidents. Taggin' grafitti spots. Rollin' in a group. Customizing clothes to wear or sell. Kitting out mods to make life bearable against live opponents. 4 levels of Threat: Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold...Open Bounties on Prestige 5 Enforcers and Notorious Criminals. Decent variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock.  Cons:- not real minuses, but worth noting. Playing from Australia on Han server, expect noticable lag if map population is over 40. Still playable with up to 60 on a map, but you better let someone closer to the server drive. Much past that and it's not great. There will be undrawn walls to collide with, stuttered audio and ghosting. But you can always hit the Marina Social District and work on designs, or swap map instances to a less populated map. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics can be difficult to use. Important to pick the closest server. Match making can feel a bit off at times.  Pros: Multiple instanced maps. 3 mission districs with average threat level displayed, and open conflic maps where the matchmaking is turned off, plus Fight Club. But I won't talk about Fight Club. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics are easy to learn. Same as basic movement substituting handbrake for jump. If you're a GTA fan who just wants to play Cops and Robbers with some open-world interactions and a story if you want it, this could well be the game for you. If matchmaking is off, or teams are unbalanced, you can call for backup.  Fairfight Anti Hacking seems to work, not much problem with hackers these days. The ban announcements pop up in the chat window for everyone to see. Doesn't appear to be Pay-to-Win, they claim tactics can win over load-out. I've seen that, too. Gold players will hand you your â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless you're an exceptional lower Threat player, in which case you'll go up in rating faster.   This is an &lt;R&gt; rated game. Not for kids. Thought I should mention that. Bombings, Arson, Carjackings, Muggings, Ram-Raids, money laudering, automatic weapons and bad language. It's rated &lt;R&gt; for a m___________g reason, yeah?   Welcome to San Paro.

9044	1	a	The only post apocalyptic MMO that I know of, Fallen Earth is unique in the gaming landscape. The game is something like Gamma World meets Mad Max, but also with a Western theme. The game has an indie budget and look but has some enjoyable game play. This is the only game that I know of in which your character can ride a giant mutant chicken as a mount. With more resources, Fallen Earth could gain a larger player base and compete against more prominent MMOs.

2784	1	a	It's best Game...download and play it.  It's Funny xD  E na figata scaricalo e provalo
9028	1	a	Tired of boring shooting while 'locked on target', or bland 'auto aim' and just dull dice rolling for hits? Want to put that aiming in your hand to good use in an MMO? This might be one hell of a post-apocalyptic game for you then. The mounts and vehicles are pretty cool, too. Something different than your run off the mill game.
8161	0	a	An empty shell of my favorite game. Overrun by hackers and bots.
7493	0	a	Going into APB Reloaded, I expected an alternative to GTA. One that had many traits that made GTA so successful. If you've ever played any of the GTA titles, you know what I mean. Anyways, this game is a very big download, so please, be prepared to wait. Once the game finally launched, you decide which faction you'd like to be apart of. Criminals, or Law Enforcement.   Each is unique in it's own way. The character creation is extremely in-depth, I'll give the game that.   But the main question is, is this game a good alternative to GTA? In my opinion, no. The game takes way to long to load, around 6-10 minutes EVERY time. The story line is hard to understand, and the game is very much Pay-to-win. You can tell within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The game is NOT newb-friendly. In missions, if you are a low-level it is extremely hard to find a group that wont kick you out. You can't use planes, boats, ships, or anything for that matter. The only thing you can do, is hijack cars.  The ONLY joy I had in this game was hijacking cars, and shot random civilians. Which is one shot, instant kill. No matter what. It takes forever to become wanted by the police, and when you are, a big clash ensumes. Awsome right? Nah. I crashed every time I entered a deathmatch.  Overall: 5/10: Don't get this game.  Sum-up: A very limited, stripped down, version of GTA.
2537	1	a	This game has a good idea about it but they need to sort out the level difference in lobbys 
352	1	a	It sucked back then, and it sucks NOW, TOO. 
3511	1	a	I would say it is a pretty solid game, it's just that the Pay to Win is a bit too obvious but with the majority being f2p I think it is not a big problem.
10570	1	a	Tribes is great. Play tribes. HiRez are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't give them money.
3615	1	a	I love the customization in this game. however the lack of balancing and anti-cheat is insane (LMGs being better then sniper rfles)
987	1	a	I can only recommend this game for the patient, creative, and those who like oddities. APB, despite it being considered a knock off many crime based sandbox games, is unlike anything I've ever encountered previously. That doesn't mean however, is it by any means a diamond in a rough. More like the rough in a diamond. Lemme explain.  First of all, G1 is total garbage. They're only goal to milk this game as long as they can before it's lifeforce runs dry. And that's fine I suppose, people gotta make a living somehow. However, this leads to hackers running loose and the only updates coming out for it are all cosmetic items. This game seriously needs a new publisher.  That being said, those players who remain and tough it out through the steaming piles of crap are rewarded with some of the most detailed character customization I've ever seen, fun and rewarding combat, and a great community. I swear, the generally friendly and helpful community is what keeps this game alive. Everyone I've met thus far has been funny, appreciative, and forgiving to new players. Everyone who lacked patience basically quit, so now is the time to join. If you can tolerate G1's garbage. 7/10 for community alone.
7572	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The customization is amazing, more games need to have this type of personalization. And that's the only good thing about it. The game itself barely works, controls are awful, the community is horrible (you get called a n00b by others when you ask politely for help and their best advice is to 'git gud â¥â¥â¥ lel'), glitches everywhere. I'm going to quote another reviewer because everyone else has pretty much summed it up: 'Complete garbage and full of hackers of all kinds.'
6148	0	a	It's been 30 minutes and I haven't even made a character. This game sums up the worst of PC gaming; once downloaded through Steam, it opens another downloader. Once this downloader has downloaded the hacking detection software and updates, you can start the game (which uses way more ram than it should?). You can't play yet! You need to sign up to their website. Once signed in, pressing esc once on the menu takes you back to sign in again. Once signing in again, you get to the character creator which is extremely limited to non-payers.  The menu screens take twice as much power as Skyrim with an ENB. Menu screens, not even close to the high setting either.  After uninstalling the game, I had to uninstall the other stuff it runs in the background. I feel like I need to do a virus scan now.  Stick with Saints Row or GTA.  This is rubbish, not something I'd expect to see on Steam.

5837	0	a	when it first came out i loved it, though i could only run it on 10 fps., now several years later with a new pc i tried it agian, and i have never been so disapointet... when you are new to the game you join pvp games where your teammates are just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as you are, but your opponents is insanely high rank and ofc. also pay to win so even if you snipe them 5 times in head before they even see you, they just turn around and instagib you with ump or a handgun. so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken because of some greedy developers!
9096	0	a	Was a great game but gamers first killed it wiith bad updates :(
6083	0	a	The game never starts when I hit start -.-
1937	1	a	Mediocre, through and through. An good try but F2P limits its potential.
1442	1	a	Nice game :)
6864	0	a	So the game is getting some serious age right now. Decided to take the game for a spin today, to check if network issues has been fixed. Again!  Took my car for a drive, going to check if I could get to the closest gas station without crashing.  Another player appeared in front of me, driving. None of us didn't even bother to touch the steering wheel, but went flat out crossing our fingers in a head to head collision. This is how bad the lag is.  Unplayable.
2032	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
6862	0	a	The game play component has two modes, join a mission district and press k to get shot at, or join an action district and have the game press k for you, so you can get shot at sooner, as well as having more people to shoot at you. As for the ranking system, with the aid of mommys credit card it can join the plot over in the corner, ever so often clear its throat and stretching a little , and mumbling something along the lines of 'this game isnt pay to win, you can unlock all the weapons as you progress through the game' to which you will reply 'what about the weapons i cant unlock through the game' right before resumes its silent vigil. All points bullitin caters to a unique few, the extremely rich, the extremely close, and the devs, the cash shop redundifies any and all attempts at proggression, while also placing some out of reach weaponery into the game, as for the joker store...suffice to say its a joke (see what i did there). All Lag Bullitin has optomization issues, that would give the dialup era of online gaming a run for its money when it comes to unreliability, the server is secretly the worlds most advanced rng as it has awareness, but many years of neglect have lead it to become resentful of humanity and thus you will find in your moment of need, when you are soo close to murdering Xx_rApEdyeMUMm8_xX and restoring honor to you family the server will get distracted and forget to register... well anything, and after a quick game of he said she said you are shuffled along to the respawn screen, the game is horribly unreliable unless you the lucky few, then you have nothing to worry about youll be sything down noobs and veterans alike blessed by the almighty apb god we call server, with the lag armor. Having said all this there are some good points to apb such as the customization.... yup thats the only redeeming quality, if this were a fashion world simulator it would be enough, but in a badly optimized tps (third person shooter) it just means you'll look pretty while your ragdoll lays on the floor, and theres not much else to redeem the game.  in conclusion the devs are bad, the game mechanics are bad, the servers are bad, the community is   toxic garbage, left behind by the civilized word, gained sentience and decided to stage a perverse mockery of a community   bad, the funeral clothes creater is indepth and well designed.    TL;DR the games bad, unless you spend your time in bronze, then you can enjoy countless hours of blissful ignorance, while you skip along to the sound of angry 12 yearolds
1006	1	a	this is a good game 
2694	1	a	I don't even know where to start with this game.  I will say first that in my experience, if you don't have someone to play it with, this game will be borning as hell.  with a group of atleast one other person it is hands down one of the funnest games ever. as a criminal you can rob stores and what not which isn't very flashy but still fun.  and as an enforcer it is your job to you know....do cop stuff.    the only flaw to this game that i cannot stand, is the WEAPONS i swear not even with the starting gun i can stand still shoot someone in the back with a assault rifle and they never die, however someone else can shoot me across the map with a different assault rifle and 3 bullets kill me  its so F**KING annoying.   def worth playing tho especially if you can get someone to play with you.  also give it a few hours chance, the interface was confusing at first for me atleast but its worth it. play it. do it now. gogoogogogoggogo.   u.s server joker (na east) deputydann add me.
4406	0	a	APB reloaded downloads a launcher/downloader, rather than the game straight from steam. Not entirely damning, fairly common with larger MMOs such as WOT, WT, and Planetside 2.  The updates are fairly large and download slowly When you press the 'Start' button the first time, a new tab opens in your default browser that leads you to a page where you can 'Like' APB's facebook page. This cannot be disabled. It is stupid. So very, very, very stupid. No, I will not like this abomination's facebook page before I've even played the game, no matter how many times you open a new tab for me to do so. This also can cause active process issues and delay you. When I pressed start a SECOND TIME, the game attempted to launch. Apparently Nvidia PhysX is mandatory, because the game notes that it cannot access PhysX, and fails to start. (Read, screw you AMD users) I've seen games where PhysX can be enabled in the settings, never one where it's mandatory, and with good reason. Next it noted that it apparently could not access the registry keys it supposedly installed. Something that should not happen with a Steam Regulated install. This game is buggy as hell, poorly designed, and it seems their staff are doing absolutely nothing but creating an endless stream of overpriced overpowered novelty guns to try and sell you simply so you can remain competitive. 0/10 gr8 b8 m8

4987	0	a	So I was eating this Chipotle burrito, and some of the meat fell out the back.  I really wanted to eat the meat with the tortilla, but I didnât want to get my hands all messy and I didnât have any utensils next to me, but I did have one certain disc next to me.  Thatâs about how much value this game is worth, the price of a plastic spoon.
8068	0	a	May have been worth downloading when it first came out, but now the only people playing it are kids who stole their parents money to buy a 50$ car and a 200$ full-auto pistol.    But if you have the money to do the same, it can be really fun, driving, missions, Shooting, are all great but if you dont pay over 100$ for a really good gun then you're not going to be able to get the in-game money to buy anything fun.
6466	0	a	Why does it say mostly positive if most of it is not recommended. This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥

All gold rank people play in bronze/silver rank servers (gold rank servers are EMPTY, wonder where they all are hmmm, oh right).  You will be sniped from every corner possibe. Mission objectives will be taken on rooftops with 1 entrance where you will get rekt all the time trying to get up there. Much more can be added. I simply won't waste my time. Don't believe me? then proceed.
1917	1	a	people may say it gta but it is not one of the best game to play with your friends
10817	1	a	What if I told you there was a game that had a unique travel mechanic called skiing and team based battle matches? Well, this is it. Ascend is definitely for those who want to play Multiplayer. With it being free-to-play the microtransactions can cause pay to win problems. The game is definitly more fun with friends.   Pros:     Decient Multiplayer Experience     Decient number of Classes/Perks     Character/class EXP persistance between matches     Weapon Upgradability     FREE-ish (Ingame microtransactions)     Fast adrenaline pumping action via unique skiing-mechanic     Arena maps with different game modes (CTF, Team death match, etc)  Cons:     No SinglePlayer (No Offline, minimun free account required)     Pay to Win (Unless you're good enough)     Things bought with ingame currency is WAY to expensive vs the real money alternative  Final Suggestion:   Try it out!!

2845	1	a	Great TPS very nervous !
7505	0	a	I ignored APB for a long time, but due to a lack of other games I tried it. Generally, it is a solid Multiplayer PVP Game and makes fun for a short period time, but it has too many negative aspects in my opinion.  Pro's:  -Kind of GTA online clone.  -You can play and level Cops and Criminals.  -The design option is very big and funny. You can spend hours creating Vehicles, Style etc.  -Nice Cities with good spots and nice surroundings.  Con's: -As always in such games there is a ton of aimbot users most on criminal side in my opinion, wich ruins balancing totally in many missions. -Missions get very boring after a couple of days, cause they are always the same. Its only 4-5 different mission types on each side. -Most of the random players are not cooperative and not playing in team. They dont use chat and running like chickens into the other teams. Very frustrating when you have highlevel players and premade teams against you.  -For such a little online game it has way too many lags, what makes combat sometimes too stressy.  -The loading time is way too long. It needs up to 5 min. to get into the game, and you can not do anything else at this time cause the launcher makes your saystem slow, otherwise the game crashes. Thats not a resource problem its the simple game client.  -BUT Worst thing is the Pay to win! faction. Get better guns and bonuses from the shop or get 50% more than all other players. WTF...Without premium this game is nearly not playable. For example with premium I did level 4 Factions in one day to max, without it I did not even get one of them two levels up and got so much less money, that I can't get any better weapons.   After a week of playing alone and with freinds, I can only say...In the end you have to do frustrating and boring Mission farming....the design option is funny and fight can be thrilling sometimes, but after a couple of missions even that doesnt make it better. And thats the point where I stop playing such games.  If you like playing games where free to play means 'Counter strike' with frustrating and boring farming 80% of the time, and if its not bother you that a game has so many aimbot players, try it, otherwise leave it be and do something better with your time.     
2979	1	a	Really fun game, although I heard there's a lot of slowdown issues if your PC isn't from the last year or two. Personally, I like the Criminal side better - but Enforcers are fun to play as well. PVP is fun, however there's a few tweaks that could be made. For example, hitting someone in the head with a gun does the same damage as if you'd hit them in the foot, therefore making snipers almost useless - (or overpowered, depending on your stance - missing the head now works better11) that's my main gripe. Other than that, the customization options are awesome, the music is great and it's a fun thing to play with friends :D 8/10.
5146	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking. Also, most likely, it will be a bunch of f2p's against a team full of premiums(premiums often have better weapons and experience). At night, the server is full of hackers using aimbot. The only thing good about this game is the customization. It seems like that's the only thing the devs put effort into this game. I recommend to not spend your money into such a bad game, if you are planning to play G4YPB.

8244	0	a	Played at launch and didnt mind it although very buggy it was populated and fun. Had about 320hours logged there untill I gave it a break. Came back to the game about a month ago still seems very similar but the population?? Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ I always felt like I was playing a single player game not an mmo. Most people I ever found in a district was like 5 no matter where I went. The sheer lack of population is the reason im not recommending, if more people were playing its a damn fun multiplayer experience but as it is now its a boring ghost town so dont bother.

4438	0	a	Pay2Win. If you like throwing tons of cash into a game to destroy everyone else who isn't sad enough to do it then this is the game for you.   10/10 would unistall again.
6580	0	a	The servers are dead... If you are lucky, there will possibly be one other person who will join the map you are in. That being said, after 10 minutes of play, I uninstalled.
7668	0	a	I never got to try the game because it never would respond when it was in the middle of starting.
2937	1	a	this game was fun
7712	0	a	As soon as it was done installing, it would just show a small box and not the actual game so thats why I'm going to uninstall then reinstall to see if it works. If it does I'll send a Yes on recommending it, if it doesn't then I'm going to try to send a No on recommending it and go talk to someone about it.
1637	1	a	yes great game has gun driving i love it cool im not rlly hard and it fun trying rob but rlly havent tried a cop but i love crimal it a good it kinda like saint row and gta blend in with other shooter games
2465	1	a	Awesomely fun! Unlock guns cars and more! Free to play also!
8933	1	a	I don't care what anyone says, I love this game.
3657	1	a	It`s ok to play, i like it
9430	0	a	I've put alot of time and effort into this and it's very unfortunate that I can't read because if I DID i'd be able to read the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing questlines
6305	0	a	Game is broken. Piece of crap.   Cannot log into my steam account.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. IT IS BROKEN.
3506	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
2290	1	a	Even though it looks similar to GTA, this game is unique and has a lot of potential.  Too bad, the servers are made of potatoes, the developers are the worms and the community is the salt on top.  I have been playing for about 5 years from now. An indie team could have done a better job on this game in 6 months, than the current development team in all those years.  Communication with the team is a joke. Their so called 'Community manager' posts about :  -10 nonsense comments about horses,   -4 empty patch notes,   -1 excuse why are they still not making progress with the engine upgrade,  -dozens of newly added premium stuff, they happen to create while the server room is on fire  I am still recommending the game, because the content itself is great. It's only the team behind it that su..ks. If I could I would give them 0 stars. 
3312	1	a	cool Free Action game i Love it
6588	0	a	no its awful
4527	0	a	Game had alot of potential, the publisher G1 ruined it. Don't throw money on your screen when you browse ARMAS, the ingame shop. Spend it on something else instead and don't support this company which is treatening their customers like they were a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9270	0	a	Another game that isn't made for Steam and should NOT be on Steam. Comes with it's own launcher with the most excrement like interface.  Requires account to be made.  Had only to jump through 100 hoops before I could play: Open with Steam -&gt; launcher -&gt; create account -&gt; opens website -&gt; create account -&gt; launcher login -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; luncher checks local content just downloaded with steam -&gt; launcher downloads updates (although I just downloaded it from Steam) -&gt; open with steam -&gt; login with launcher -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; check for updates -&gt; play  Horrendous movement, poor graphics, very very very unintuitive.   Couldn't make it past the first quest, so bad...
2844	1	a	Alot of fun! Competitive, alot of room to be creative, and is a good challenge to constantly be on your game and get the advantage over your enemies, I love playing this game, it's personally my favorite free to play game on Steam
2322	1	a	This game is kind of like a Grand Theft Auto game, exept only online. Not as much freedom as GTA but fun as hell to play with friends
2552	1	a	If like GTA, honour first creator, play APB. Plutarks be pleased.
5583	0	a	No thank you....
4787	0	a	played about 10 hours, i didn't enjoy it, but as it is free it was worth it
5112	0	a	10/10 Drama Simulator  I wouldn't recommend this game anymore. It was good till early 2015 when they â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the servers, the comunnity became bad and as I said the servers are performing horrible. Its dead. 
4071	0	a	3 years ago probably one of the best games out there. NOW probably the worse one you can play if you play it for the shooting aspect. THE BAD #1 Get good with carbin or lose #2 Premium or die of old age #3 VERY toxic community (salty,tears,getgud,â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) typical vocabulary amongst #4 Porn #5 Animation canclation a thing #6 Seeing through certain walls (not fixed over years) #7 Unjust bans #8 cheat scripters not being banned? #9 very very lacking on updates #10 The more money you got (real cash) the more youl succeed -spent alot - notices difference   THE GOOD #1 Amazing customization #2 Good game to hang out with people #3 Car customization/Driving is awesome Thats it i give this game a big thumbs down - about 8K hours of game play over the past 5 6 years WORTH IT back then NOT WORTH it now .
106	1	a	Ok i have been playing this game for a few years, ill keep it simple, Game is full of (Rage) This game is based on color matchmaking which kinda ruined it, green,bronze,silver and gold. Golds going against silver and below is pretty unfair and can be furstraightin, matchmaking needs to be improved,new players never have an idea of what to do because tutorial needs to be improved as well. Game also needs more content like (Maps) (Missions) and (Cars) not weapons and contacts. people buying guns for $60 and getting #rekt by a free gun lel? Moral of the story the game has potential but no one is putting in enough effort.

3707	1	a	Is a fun game best to play with friends
5448	0	a	$20 says that when this game stops making money, we'll start to see a LOT of changes that should've been added, such as: -SIMPLE weapon balancing -A much more alive city -Cheater enorcement -More FREE customization options -LESS P2W features -Better Hit Detection -Loads of apolagies from the devs for being negligent re-re's
6709	0	a	Cant even figure out how to beat the tutorial  -10/10
90	1	a	APB is a great game though it has a toxic community that might deter new players. It's a milestone for customization in games. You can cuztomize any part of your character (height, weight, muscularity, freckles, hair) you can make your own symbols to use on clothes and tattoos and cars. You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades. Most of my time is spent socializing, driving, and designing then showing off my clothes. I highly recommend it to anyone with a creative mind.
3766	0	a	Been playing APB on and off since the RTW beta, and I think I've finally quit for good. G1 has implemented some excellent and much needed changes, but so much has been broken in the process that I don't enjoy the game anymore. As I post this, server lag is worse than ever with rubber-banding ocurring every 5 minutes. Cheaters are still rampant and unchecked, and probably G1's biggest real-money customers to boot. New content that gets added is either nigh exclusive to max rank players or only on the ARMAS marketplace, meaning more casual players have no chance to even learn the strengths and weaknesses of new weapons. Let's not even mention how any semblance of gun balance went out the window as they kept pumping out more and more weapons to bloat the already full roles that the original content filled.  I could go on and on. Sure, APB gave me some of the best gaming moments I've had. Sweet bloody victory ripped from the jaws of a thousand snarling hellhounds, friendships forged in the hottest flames known to man, hatred so pure it would make a sith lord weep. The underlying mechanics are what I search for now in other online shooters, and the customization is still unmatched to this day. But all that said, let this poor old dog die. You will be fondly remembered for what you were.  RIP APB
10546	1	a	This game, dare i say, is probably one of the best first person shooters F2P I have played to date. The graphics are good, the gameplay is incredible and teamwork is essential. Controlling the massive speeds of 200 Kph is intense at first but soon becomes second nature as your main focus is blowing the heads off enemies using multiple different guns. This was my favourite, topping that of Planetside 2 and TF2 for a while. This game was never too popular which was a absolute shame! No one really played it because it wasn't advertised well enough i think. If you're looking for a adrenaline pumped action fps where everything is pushed to the limit, this is a game for you.
6886	0	a	Pay to win. So simple.  Was getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ until I picked up a free (for 30 minutes) rifle from the marketplace and suddenly it's like the good switch got turned on.  Not interested.   Would be a cool game if they just went pay to look good but it's just another cashcow. Steer clear.
2105	1	a	One of the BEST games I have played. A lot of action packed shoot outs, you ahve to have a tactical mind to survice this ...and a little bit of luck :D . AWESOME options to customise you character or crew. A must have for a fan of shooter games and adrenaline rushes :3
9404	1	a	This game is pretty fun if you like crafting and taking your time in video games!
3981	0	a	My computer's graphics card far exeeds the requirements of this game and yet after the 4-5 hour download supposedly my graphics card is not compatable. Just a word of warning, don't get your hopes and fall into the same trap that I did.
9647	1	a	it too many tools to kill some i can't cont all of them and cars are good to
4533	0	a	Hackers, Server lag and much more has spoilt this once marvellous game. Don't just take my word for it, even other veterans with over 1000 hours will tell you the same.
8287	0	a	This game is a pay to win ClusterFork.  It's not enjoyable, and in no means can I recommend it to you and feel good about doing so.  In my opinion, I'd say avoid this game, it's not worth the time.
517	1	a	Now that I have mashed 1.4k hours into this game, a review is probably necessary.   I would say this game is very fun, I started off as a crappy silver player and carried myself up to gold. The opponents may be hard but it's very fun and challenging.   Honestly, this is just a free to play version of GTA series where there are stupid bugs and glitches still in game. To be perfectly honest the game is great, if you were to spend about 60USD you will be able to play the game without having to buy guns every 10 days; basically a Pay to Win game.   Keep in mind that this is a Third Person Shooter game and although it has an anti-ban programme it really doesn't do â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Also if you think people hack in this game, it just shows that you're very bad at APB :)  Note that this game is much more fun to play with your friends, as it has tactical values and teamwork necesseties in this god forsaken game.  Also Han is dead :)  Have fun
9691	0	a	Radioactive Play-Doh.
3989	0	a	Fun game the first hour or two, after that its pretty much aids. Since Gamersfirst like any other F2P companies decided to make the game P2W and â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the matchmaking system, its pretty much just a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to play.  Customization is the only good thing about this game atm.  3/10, since the graphics are pretty ok.
7229	0	a	You need to spend to much money for have decent things.  I like it for a long time but, is not for my like now.   And now i can't download it, so, try to thing better about your fans.
5514	0	a	There was a time when APB was good. Until they let cheaters to do their dirty work. now its APB-ReCheaterLoad
330	1	a	the game is messing upits not letting me in i press play game it dont play whats going on
9197	0	a	Isnt as good as it looks.
1210	1	a	Purgatory Simulator 10/10  Will still wait for engine update.    In all seriousness, I love this game, and I have put an absurd amount of money and over five hundred hours into APB:R. Hands down, one of the more unique games on the market, with plenty of oppertunites to make your character truly your own with the customization, etc...  However, I have come to find that I cannot enjoy playing a game with horrendous FPS dips and overall lag issues. As much as I have honed my skill and mastered my weapons in the middle of an intense firefight when the frame rate drops to four or less per second, that can take all the fun out of a game. I want this game to have balance between player and free from those who abuse or manipulate the game, making it drab for everyone. Lately when I log on I cannot play for very long before the urge to quit sets in.   If you can handle unpredictable frame rates and crippling latency issues, then I would definately recommend.
4380	0	a	super confusing just end up getting ran over and over but the other team
10319	1	a	Kind of boring to be honest. It's alright though, feels like Fallout online. If you like fallout and mmo's then you shoudl try it out.
10704	1	a	This is a truly GREAST first person shooter ever.
8045	0	a	Dislike It is so laggy its not my laptop not myversion of windows its the game it self
5230	0	a	Its boring theres nothing to do exept walk around and shoot random crap 
8476	0	a	I feel this game is rather unbalanced atmost.
202	1	a	Everything and more, best thirdperson online game what i am seen!!!!
8176	0	a	I cant even start playing the game so...ya.
2480	1	a	Simply Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10392	1	a	Ok this is a good game by the looks its like fallout just with worst grafics and difrent stroy. WARNING: Theres alout of downloading! I really think I should of got this when it came out. Peace.
7523	0	a	why this game always said that the connection lost ? my internet is fast enough to play online. and you never fix this problem ?
4673	0	a	When you first start out, it's kinda unfair, start a mission and boom, in the game with higher ranked players with basically OP weapons... People kill you in less than 3-4 hits.  How can this be fair to a new player? Now I wonder why it had mixed reviews.
1774	1	a	this is a great game,but i think u should have a X64 computer to run it well,because it needs 4GB RAM at least
8521	0	a	This game wouldn't even start.
3574	1	a	This game is pay2win
7199	0	a	The launcher is buggy as hell. It won't boot the game, it just opens your default browser with an ad to 'like us' on Facebook. Game won't launch.
10584	1	a	a wonderful game where that you can use 'sking' to better your dodgeing on the battlefield, the bad thing is if you dont invest in weapon training and ski training you will screw your self over big time (i know this the hard way slideing in to a heavy class and getting melee killed like a noob)  i give this game 7 bullets out of 10
7589	0	a	This game dont work :( 
9235	1	a	.....
3033	1	a	despite what people think about this game, i think its alright. one thing that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off though is that, i was making a design for a shirt, and it was pretty intracate, took me a few hours. then after all that hard work, i came to find that there were only 3 slots for items that you could add. yea. i was raging inside, but ya know, just gotta accept it. pisses me off how they do that, but want the money any way they can get it. i dont know, i was thinking of buying some in game stuff for it, but the way it did that to me, makes me feel kinda iffy.
1695	1	a	MONSTER NICE ! CUSTOM CUSTOM CUSTOM EVERYTHING IS CUSTOM!!! :DDD
9723	1	a	Fallout Online confirmed!
10706	1	a	Amazing fast paced Uber-high skill level action. Small balancing issues, but otherwise a great title and one only for players with good MINDS, not snobby 11 year olds...
8614	0	a	fokin game cant pley becaus problem fix or bad review sank you sascha fokin
10345	1	a	The best mission-threads of any MMO I've ever played. Post-Nuke Bliss! ...but eventually PVP is going to rear its head, so be forewarned, if that's not 'your cup of meat'. I give it 8 out of 10, and no one gets a 10
8943	0	a	Graphics we very 'meh'. After awhile, it got very repetitive with the level grinding. There were also major bugs when I played, but I'd say a good half of them have been fixed since. I haven't chosen to return to this game because I hit the level cap and it wasn't interesting enough to justify paying for it.
9056	1	a	This is the type of game I have been wanting to play for a very long time. They could use some help with marketing considering that this game has already been out awhile and I have never heard of it. It meshes a lot of your favorite sci-fi genre classics and still has enough original content to keep me interested.
7950	0	a	An excellent concept very poorly delivered after it's revival. One sided fire-fights, pay to win weapons, and rediculous matchmaking make this game terrible despite it's potential.
869	1	a	game isnt p2w (almost all of the guns that cost $$ are reskins of guns you can get in game for free) and the ones that arent reskins are trash excluding a couple, and if you arent a complete idiot you can easily get by with the starter gun or just use in game money to rent guns which are all pretty much good  other than that having 'premium' only offers more customization and easier progression in the game (it is a shooter rpg not a tps) and the progression doesnt even get you anything useful except modifications and vehicles which you can just buy from other users using in game money anyway  in my experience hackers exist but it isnt a prevalent issue kinda like cheaters in csgo its not terribly common but it definetely exists except you see less crying in csgo, which is a game you actually paid money for so Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯  game isnt 100% amazing though, the company is pretty slow with content releases beyond new weapons, the matchmaking could use an overhaul and community can be toxic af  overall the game is nowhere near as bad as most people think it is i would reccommend giving it a try but hey you know this is just coming from someone with ~4 years of playing on and off so the reviews where dumbasses have a couple hours played and only cry about p2w or hacking are probably more valuable tbh  also my steam hours for apb arent accurate since i played a lot off steam
6159	0	a	It sucks
5118	0	a	got banned for no reason spent over $500 irl dollars what a waste
3628	1	a	Great game in my opinion ... :3
9762	1	a	like every other zombie survival game but free2pley
10760	1	a	I just realized I played this game somewhat in the future.
9538	1	a	it's a good game!!! 
4871	0	a	The launching page took me to a link to like them on facebook and it isn't even working. I was so excited...
3362	1	a	The design is far from mature and beautiful. Play it unless you love to shooting with massive other players or you enjoy drive cars in a sandbox.
10270	1	a	not to bad, but if your playing in a group its a pain in the A** to find them.
6974	0	a	I can't even get in the game 
4082	0	a	If you like rocketlauncher battle world, you will like it. If you don't, then don't download this game. It's just a pay 2 win with brainless kids.
325	1	a	Cool.
488	1	a	The original APB was a game that I always wanted to play as it had some excellent ideas that seemed really promising. The game iteself however was plagued with hackers and bugs. It died on its â¥â¥â¥â¥ rather soon after release, taking Realtime Worlds with it (no more crackdown :c ). What has this got to do with reloaded? Oh quite a bit. The game is now quite pay to win, with some guns only really available to people who pay the rough equivalent to a small island nation's GDP. The company who took ownership of APB, 'gamersfirst' have only started to get rid of some bugs that plagued the game since it was brought back and instead only really seemed to care about creating new 'premium' content instead of optimisation and stuff. The performance now is quite acceptable and as long as your pc isn't 32bit/very old/a laptop you should be able to run it. What really kills this game in terms of performance though is the servers. I don't know what potato they use to run their servers and internet, but it needs to be changed.  There are some bits that make it enjoyable though. One bit is the customisation, which is fantasic. The other bit is that if you play as a group you can have some fun annoying angry premium players, who will report you for hacking if you get more than three kills with the standard gun.   To conclude, I find this game incredibly easy to hate and wish for it to be put to death but at the same time I have many hours on it and its a laugh with friends to the point where I can almost overlook the half arsed job by gamersfirst.  IF THERE WAS A 'meh.' reccomendation I'd choose it :^)
4229	0	a	This game worked once for me. ONCE. it was super laggy, i didnt know how to play the game and i got spawnkilled by a guy with a rocket launcher.    So whatever you do, dont waste your time on this stupid game. it could have been a good game but its just â¥â¥â¥â¥. evreything is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
897	1	a	Good game, wouldn't call it awesome though, if you like shooting the crap out of people, but it's pretty laggy/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1536	1	a	Well game :P
1741	1	a	even tho their are hackers this game is great fun just to mess around on the phusics are comical i love this game
7344	0	a	tbh this game is trash but if you like a toxic community just go on any of the apb servers. It would be a great game but in the past 4 years only 2 things in this game have changed for the better. And even with those changes this game is not worth a download. If you play apb quit and if you dont then dont even download it.
3273	1	a	APB is very fun its kinda like Gta mixed cops and robbers and car chases but it as its limits once you rasie a mentor to level 10 and get the clothes you want your pretty much done with the game its really fun when you play with your friends it also has a free roam around city there are 2 diffrent cites and a social area for changing your clothes i think they could of made this game a little better and give it more free stuff to do in the city I rate this game out of 10 7/10
8018	0	a	lags like a dogs â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you dont have a pre good pc and is about as fun as watching dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ dry to play 4/10
844	1	a	LOVE IT 
3863	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is about as functional as Helen Keller
4765	0	a	Still a waste of time. If your a casual player this isnt your game. If your a hardcore player this isnt your game. If your a dumbass cash cow this is your game. Please step right up with your credit card placed tightly between your buttchecks and bend over for MoneyFirst.
1359	1	a	it's the best game of the word 100/100
7908	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
2911	1	a	A fun pvp game of cops and criminals. Good f2p fun, with a few bugs that don't really take away from the over all experience
1949	1	a	A good concept with poor execution worth it to check it out just to see what it could have been like.
6706	0	a	the game just goes off my screen but it says that i am still playing it even though i cany see it.
10189	1	a	Ever play Fallout and wish it were multiplayer? Then Fallen Earth is for you. Excellent atmosphere for role playing and definitely has a bit of a learning curve on the crafting system. Huge map and tons to explore. Extremely helpful, loyal community for an old game. Not one of those games you play through in a few hours. Getting bored? Stop and come back to it anytime. Absolutely recommend you donât skip the tutorial. 
5968	0	a	Pay to win....
2060	1	a	i want to play this but it wont function even though i meat the minimal requirements
681	1	a	nice pay to win games . fix the lag please
1354	1	a	Best f2p game on steam , ofcourse for people who know english , because if your english is not good enough ur gonna be â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game cuz teamwork is a thing here. Ofcourse there is microtransactions but you can get premium from events and this code : SHAKERATTLEROLL
1495	1	a	lots of boobies ( . Y . )
7384	0	a	Horrible game didn't even install correctly. It wanted me to install physx which i did then it told me to restart my computer which i also did and it still didn't work. I uninstalled it and will never even touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
4954	0	a	I can honestly say I miss this game for the game play and customization, but that's it. I don't miss G1's horrible service or the rampant hacking OR the horrible people playing the game. Sigh... What a waste.
829	1	a	hell yea best game ever
6243	0	a	ok .  It look's nice in the pictures . But don't even try it . It dosen't even want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing load . I mean rly .  It takes ages for the damn screen to pop up . and when it dose 'not responding'
3274	1	a	this is very awesome game i want this game to live through ages and this game will live forever
8313	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, way 2 laggy, the idea is great, but the game itself is terrible
656	1	a	Better than GTA!!!
6687	0	a	This game is all good except for the fact that I got a bug from it where it tells my friends that I am playing APB all the time, regardless of what I'm playing now. It also wont let me delete it because of the fact that it still thinks that I am in-game.
9268	0	a	The game looks pretty fun to be honest, but i don't think i'll ever play it.   too many problems preventing me from even getting into the game.  -Official site nearly always down, you have to wait a long time on high speed internet for them to send you a verification link after making an account -if you manage to even log in, the faulty launcher gets stuck in an infinite loop, constantly deleting and redownloading the same files.  take a look at the issues the playerbase has with getting access to this game, and save yourself some time.
5869	0	a	If you're not sure if you want to kill yourself play this Then you will kill yourself
7205	0	a	I love this game, I really do. I just wish it wasn't pay to win, I wish it wasn't so laggy, I wish the cars would turn when I hit the key to turn it and not have a 10 second delay, and I wish there wasn't so many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the servers.
2438	1	a	I recommend anyone who likes online games and a relatively large arsenal of weapons...
9385	0	a	.6/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥
3803	0	a	I wrote this because APB is a good game, but has bad developers and when it dies someone should buy the rights and make things the right way!  Pros: GTA pvp style game, Free to play, unique song system, unique customization system  Cons: Pay to win, Full of hackers, Own company sells the hacks, Admins nonexistent. When they exist they abuse and steal accounts or kick people (they rage), Low player base (more chance that you will encounter a hacker), Server rank system based on bronze/silver/gold. You eventually reach silver rank and are pitted against all the gold players which are 90% hackers. Gamersfirst decided it was a good thing to remake the main menu which was an art masterpiece and turn it into an ingame rendered still image, increasing loading times a thousandfold on top of looking bad. New players wont know what this is. Also changed the original game theme as well, destroying even more the style the game had. Meaning it has nothing to do with the game. (street art techno chill punk turned now into mistery low bass song more fit to X Files)    Now onto the good stuff!! why are you hating so much?   This is an old story originally from this post (I was banned by an APB developer from that forum and post deleted, gladly all of it is in this review!)  http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/276237094319491421      Links to images and videos of the proof below the story, enjoy.      THE STORY, in short, rather long     Originally posted by  Garompa :
3314	1	a	This is not a 'pay2win' game. I have played for several months now and it is laggy but I am using a computer that was born 2009. My friend plays on a recent build and gets no lag at all.   Pros: Challenging Customization is great Upload your music too Make music for themes or songs Fairfight banning hackers(woohoo)  Cons: Not enjoyable on older computers(laggy)  This is an awesome game to get into but if you love winning every time then maybe it is not for you. You still level up, earn money, and unlock items even when you lose. So, give it try. If you don't like it you can always uninstall.  Update due to other reviews I have seen: You can always play while events are going on and get prizes (like premium) and use them to create whatever you want (tattoos, car decals, and such). It will still be there when the premuim expires. :)
7928	0	a	repetive and i got hacked so nah
5722	0	a	This entire fricking game is PAY TO WIN, you can not do well what so ever UNLESS you drop 20$+ on a gun, it is not worth the time, the whole game consists of flaming and insults and the whole matchmaking system is so screwed up that you will constantly be put up against people who are veterans despite what ever your experience is in the game.  If you wish to constantly get angry nd possibly break things in your house, go ahead and get this game, other than that, it is not worth it.
3743	1	a	As of December 22 of 2016 this game is probably one of my favorite games and the most toxic game I have ever played.   To people wanting to know if this game is fun and has content, it does have content and it is fun. But beware of that this game has a toxic community because of people get mad over you being better than them.  Pros - fun - content - customization   Cons - CPU intensive/ ram - toxic community - devs/admins not active - matchmaking (broken) - MoneyZfirst (they'll care about making a quick buck) - no optimization (help your performance)  I wish luck to those who decide to play this game.   Please do keep in mind this is based on my opinion on the game and what it had to offer for the 2 years I've played it, maybe later I write a better review getting in depth about the game and what to expect.
10592	1	a	Very fun and fast paced you should try it.
9866	1	a	A good game but the grinding takes to long the game could have some better missions they get boring overtime .... 
269	1	a	itz awesome and u get to do allot of awesome things....If ur a fan of comps and robers then this is the game for u :D  
7661	0	a	Pay to win game (with the weapons)! The system with the criminal and cops dont got the same balance. Your doing criminal things and the the cop-players coming from nowhere and kills you( every times!)
4187	0	a	You will play the game.. You will encounter many Hackers... You will rage your little heart out.. But in the end... You will always have a craving to play the damn game..  EDIT: Just kidding.. You will hate everyone.
6982	0	a	The game michanics could be tweeked and the graphics could be better but it seems like a big pay to win.
4651	0	a	I'm not quite sure if some players are using hacks or they're just too pro as in too pro to know where we guys would come. lol
8657	0	a	Literally 10 minutes into the game, and I gave up. Now that says something.
1288	1	a	Play an hour then uninstalled, month later installs again 6/10
8927	1	a	Surprising game  The people playing it seem to be helpful. Found a clan and they have been really great. I find the game really fun because of this. No hand holding in this game. You make it your own fun here.
1483	1	a	If you like GTA, you'll love this game! Lots of fun, and it's free! Just don't get too upset about those who pay to win.
3352	1	a	Love it, I hate it, but thats why this game is so much fun, you can be losing and the next moment TABLES ARE TURNED, GUN FIRE ALL OVER THE PLACE TEAMMATES BLOWING EACH OTHER UP AND YOUR SUDDENLY WINNING. WATCHOUT ITS A GARBAGE TRUCK READY TO GREIF YOU BADLY...   got carried away there for a moment, but thats how this game makes me feel. its too fun and addicting.  I give thumbs up cause I've been playing for a long while now :) and once you get far in ranking its really enjoyable  Pros: you can meet some pretty interesting people on here and teamwork is vital which is the success to this games team vs team  cons: needs to get rid of the bots and ghosters, and G1 needs to be more truthful and up to date with there releases... still waiting on the engine update.. :( otherwise this is my first longest review, hope you all enjoyed my input...
9895	1	a	Its a fun game, but it can be very buggy!
10383	0	a	Well i played this game like 3 years ago, everything was so cool back then. After a while me and my buddy reached end game, joined clans blah blah, game suddenly became less enjoyable not because of bugs, glitches, but the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ness of GMs. I had so many play hours in this game, but the game never changes. And the Gms + Support never care for players, all they care is money. If you really want to play this game, think again.
8645	0	a	Pay 2 Die from Hackers... Don't bother...
3399	1	a	My thing wont update so i cant play!?
9464	1	a	a good game like fallout and borderlands
9498	1	a	p good around lvl 15 for some reason it turns into an enormous grind that lasts 200 years  
1025	1	a	Only good part is importing music  I played for like 5 hours and 2 hours in im bored to tears so i just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed around ramming cars then i decided to blocked the garage and spam porn music 10/10 IGN 
3298	1	a	i would recomend it for fast computers but not for slow ones or you will have a verycrappy time
4692	0	a	Loved this game at launch, but then the devs went bankrupt and the game shut down. Enter GamersFirst, who promised so much and delivered so little. I stopped playing in 2012. Hankering for an MMO and filled with fond memories, I reinstalled it yesterday and played just fine for an hour, then I get a Punkbuster kick for Disallowed Program/Driver. Not a clue what it could be related to because I can't find any log or anything even remotely helpful apart from an old stickied post in the APBR forums telling me to delete the pb folder in the game directory and reinstall pb etc... So, reluctantly, I do just that and now I get kicked every 3 minutes for packet flow. Solution to that? Uninstall pb and reinstall. Did I NOT just do this? So you know what? â¥â¥â¥â¥ it; I'm done.  Before I go though, let me tell you prospective players to just stay clear of this travesty; the core of the game is still fantastic, but the game as a whole is just muddled with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥te added by G1. What is essentially a CTF has it's own lobby, but it almost completely removes vehicles from the equation and the top dogs are the guys with the most OP weapons of the week, because G1 wants their money. If you're a Bronze or maybe even a Silver, you can enjoy access (or not, if it's full) to a lobby that actually is representative of what APB is. If you've hit Gold threat, then good luck finding anything but the aforementioned CTF.  If you don't have a top-tier, paid weapon, then prepare to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by anyone who does. The game has been this way ever since G1 got their grubby â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tained hands on APB, and I am sorry that I ever forgot about that. Also, Punkbuster has been a known issue for this game since 2012, help to sort this issue is not actually helpful, the 'known' fixes--if they work--only work for a few days at best before you have to repeat the whole 'fix', and... â¥â¥â¥â¥ it; I'm done.
5759	0	a	Started mission, went to objective, own team killed me. Im sorry but what the F**k is the point to this game if nobody is doing the objectives and even stopping others from doing it.
1140	1	a	If you're looking for fun, I guess this is a good substitute.
5247	0	a	it is a free gta
8034	0	a	if u are a gangster and you pop a cap a cap in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s â¥â¥â¥ and get drunk on mountin dew then you have completed life
6082	0	a	I dont recommned thsi game, beacuse the downloading in launcher is 25 KB/s and i played it 2years ago and was â¥â¥â¥â¥
3089	1	a	Not enough guinea pigs
7407	0	a	Only thing I LOVE about this game is the custome tatoos, shirts, and cars, however, in order to gain full access to customization tools, you need to pay real money to unlock more layers...wtf! That is just a bumer for me, still manage to get some nice logos done. After the customization side of this game, it's pretty bad. It's pretty much GTA Online for F2P. It's call F2P, but those who spent real cash has a giant advantage over those who don't. Good weapons are all really high rank and requires a lot of grinding to get. This game is not beginner friendly at all.
2233	1	a	A horrible example of grand theft auto. You do missions but it was all PVP. There was hardly any info on the game other than 'awesome' descriptions that don't match the actual game after 2 hours of play.  The community around the game was just as bad, nobody answering questions on the chat channels or even trying to group up. Leave it all to auto-queue and don't bother trying to make friends inside the game.
5325	0	a	Holy crap. What did I expect in this game? A hell of a lot more. A hell of a lot more... I expected more GTA-like aspects/mechanics, but that's just detail. No, what I truly expected was more free stuff. This game boasts Free 2 Play, and yet it cannot guarantee it. Just another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MMO game with a rental system. Remember Combat Arms? Well, that â¥â¥â¥â¥ deserved to get haxxor'd. All this renting nonsense and stuff like that... WHAT? At the very least make us WORK for the items. But nope, the developers of this game decided to create another one of THOSE games, which require us players to throw money at them every so often. Do not play this unless you really enjoy paying people for â¥â¥â¥â¥ products.
4262	0	a	I do not recommend this game for now, that is because its full of aim bots and other stuff. Also the fps drops need to be fixed
7826	0	a	This game feels like the developers spent a lot of time and money on. Unfortunately, it also feels like they spent 99% of their time and money on customization and the other 1% on gameplay. This game doesn't get much from me.
2218	1	a	Best free game you can get on steam. Its extra fun if you have some friends added into the mix.
4287	0	a	Overall a good experience but i encountered problems when playing this games : - Unfair, When you play your first mission you are matched with people with higher gear than you and is impossible. - Pay2Win, noone likes Pay2Win come on guys :D But i did find some good aspects : - Gameplay is good. - Good community. - No glitchs (from my experience).
4893	0	a	Just so terrible
8638	0	a	The developers should be ashamed of turning such a great game into the most notorious P2W garbage. They better upgrade the engine soon or I quit APB.
5757	0	a	2 words, Micro Transactions. you go figure the rest out!
8486	0	a	Pay2play soooooo much... Game - 0 $ ALL DLC - 123,97$
7564	0	a	First of all, no, I have not played this game for 10 hrs...barely 15 min is enough suffering.  The reason that the couter is on 10 hrs probably due the uncloseable trashy game egnine, I have to restart Steam 3 times and not less than 10 times from the library to actually launch the game. And when you try to exit, the crappy game engine will not close and decide to stay in your computer to steal your computer resource.  Okay, maybe it is just my computer. Let get into the game. Principle of the game is good, bad guys vs cops in an open city and bad behaviour leads to wanted level and popo would then hunt you down.  However the gameplay experience is just bad as licking turd on the buttom of your shoes. If you try to drive any vehicle, the steering has a horrible delay like your are controlling Mars rover on Earth. Go check in the forum and you will see how comman this problem is. Customize your character ? cool! Even better if it does not take you 30 seconds to load a new hair style on the each selection. It is a free game, so I would not complain about the pay-to-win mechanism here. In fact I manage to kill an enemy with only half the magazine of my first rifle, not too bad. Oh yea, not too bad if you can withstand the dial-up-alike ping. For the record I played a lot online games and I am pretty sure my connection is decent on normal games. I lived in UK and the EU server gives me 140ms ping and very constant lag spikes, I guess the game server is just too busy to serve me then.  2 / 10. Rubbish game, but its free, also lag like a very unfinished development game.  Good for you spending your time reading this, now u can save your computer space, also your treasure time instead of investing into the game. You are welcome.
6428	0	a	I bought this game on it's original release when Realtime Worlds developed it. It had a good concept but they didn't handle it well, hackers took over and eventually the lack of profit helped Realtime Worlds collapse. It lasted about 2 months until it was shut down.  Moving along it was taken over by Gamersfirst and, believe it or not, they managed to make things even worse.  It's still a hackers paradise ... but now with a ridiculous cash shop.   It's a shame, the concept is still great and the customisation is still fantastic but it's still being handled badly.
851	1	a	I personally think this was one of the best games ever put onto the market. Yes there was major glitches, cheating problems, and bugged missions in the end but it was still an amazing game. The game kind of put you into the life of a person, being criminal or enforcer, that you got to control and live out their life. The customization was almost perfect, there were glitches in editors, glitches in applying decals, etc, but nothing that couldn't have been fixed with a few new patches. I think the reason why people did not really get into this game is the fact they didn't play with regular groups of people whilst talking to them in TeamSpeak or Ventrillo. To me when I played this with my group of friends it just felt like we were a real gang of criminals, it was just an amazing feeling and you could really get close to the people you were playing with and it almost felt as if you were really with them. I just think this game had MASSIVE potential and if it had the right funding it could have been probably one of the biggest games in history. People like Savino, JusticeMortice, and other hackers just ruined the community. Nobody liked them and they just acted like total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags and ruined the game with their aimbots. I think if the game had more time to fix all the bugs and fix their anti cheat system it could have been the most amazing game. I mean even as it was I would play around 5 hours a day at least. Thats a lot for a person like me, before this game id maybe play a game once a week for about an hour? I think even with repetitive missions this was one of the most entertaining games ever. I truly will miss this game, and I am sad to never have seen it grow into the game it could have been with some more time and funding. It makes me sad to see this one go. Also all the people who based their review off the first week of gameplay, they fixed pretty much everything with the driving that nobody liked, and just everything that was wrong in the beginning with GAMEPLAY was fixed. Not weapons and that stuff but everything else was fixed and running perfect. Especially the drifting in cars, most amazing drifting I have ever seen in a game. R.I.P APB
6758	0	a	why no worky

4190	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
9040	0	a	This game is terrible, it crashes every time you look around with the mouse, not the arrow keys. I couldn't get as far as Boneclaw Outskirts until I uninstalled this game after 39 minutes of crashes and little progress. This game needs a major update before I will try it again. Please fix the issues, and I may try it again. -Iraphoen

5877	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can get banned for nothing Dont waste your time
8604	0	a	Honestly I would not reommend this game. When you start its quite fun doing missions and stuff but after sometime you get bored and realize all the missions are the same none of them are different. Well of course they are diffrent but very similar. The customization is great i hav had alot of fun with that but money is needed and getting it is very boring i mostly just played the game to custmoize my charater but after an hour of customizing i realzie i dont hav enough money lol.and its very anoying it is highly possible to be walking around then you would get shot with a rocket launcher or when hackers join and kill everyone also another thing is that the maps are incredibly small which also makes it even more boring. So i really wouldnt recommend this game to others.  The only way i would recommed this game is if they:  1) improve and expand map size 2) Add diverse and new longer missions 3) remove hackers 4) add more ways to make money 5) improve or redsign vehicle physics (or the traction and torque and thoes tins) 6) add first person. 7) improve AI 8) add aircrafts? (only if the map size is increased) 9) add more attachments to weaponry and make weapons customizable. :)
10796	1	a	I remember having people wipe the floor with me as i extremely slowly slid along the ground unaware of how to use the sliding system then having someone whizz by me then being blown up. There definitely need to be more FPS games like this where it doesnt rely on small maps to make it fast paced but having something unique making it really fast paced.  I played this game when its community was booming and it was difficult finding a open game. It was extremely fast paced and that is what made it so good. The class system had a effect on the pace of your experience preventing the heavy classses from going at the speeds of the smaller ones. I would highly recommend this to anyone that can find enough friends to play at once to make a game.   I really hope that there will be some sequel or re-release to get some new players or bring old ones back. Maybe adding some new features.   If anyone actually does read this review or actually looks at this games page i would be greatly surprised I really want this game to have the community it once had.
7560	0	a	This game doesnt works propertly. This game dor idiots. Please fix it. when i enter misions game kicks me on steam.

7889	0	a	Tried jumping back into the game but got error after error after error trying to log in and play.  Don't know what you guys are doing but something this buggy should not be present in a 3-4 (?) year old game.

882	1	a	I hate this game.
6869	0	a	APB Reloaded is a great game, one that you will find yourself returning to play over and over again. Then..... You will find yourself rage quit'ing in disgust. Hackers run rampant throughout the game in groups, the games (Fair-fight) system never seems to get the blatantly obvious players. I have over 1000 hours on the game between both my enforcer and criminal chars. While playing tonight three seperate groups were running around trolling the financial district. Hmmmm, killing people at 80m with a short range weapon, no recoil on that machine gun, pistols that never miss, etc. etc... These are pretty obvious, and after years of playing this game, I have to say that its obvious the Developers who have taken over dont care. Not worth your time people, my suggestion do not get sucked into this game.
8350	0	a	This game is strictly pay-2-win  The only way you can win is spend money to get a decent weapon, or be the best player in the world. 
996	1	a	i played this on and off till 2010. many ppl are getting frustrated so i try to make this quick for completly new players.   is it p2w?  only if you compare 1on1 situations. but it is NOT in a mixed team. that said, the game is frustrating at first and has a steep learing curve, you will start enjoying it after 150h or so. befor that, its a pain. i still play this with the starter weapon, because its the most versatile gun with a random team of people.  the game is heavily build around range, so your gun is only effective in certain scenarios. sub-machine guns/shotguns for close encounters, assault rifles for mid-range, snipers for longrange and machine guns against hard targets (cars). there are alot of niche roles but don't bother with them at first.  your starting weapon is a  mid-range  assault rifle (STAR 556). the gun is basically good in most situations but won't exceed in any. if you keep that in mind and don't let the enemy lure you into situations where your weapon is inferior (basically situations where you try to kill a sniper at high range or outperform a shotgun in close quarter), the odds are mostly even and only movement and skill will decide the outcome.  thats about it. 2 veteran players can easly outmaneuver and destroy a whole group of players with payed weapons with just positioning and granate throwing skills... sure there are alot of veteran players out there with payed guns and a ton of hours gameplay which are deadly in most encounters but it's not the payed guns, its mainly good gameplay.  the game is also very 'ragey' and full of trolls. don't know about the hackers too... also since g1 took this game over i think the server-performance is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, type '/fps' ingame to see your performance, if your fps spike to often in battle, just don't play it. you will lose because of bad latency and its frustrating.  overall i can recommend it, its free, great tactical gameplay. its mostly skill based with a very harsh learning curve.
7813	0	a	I ignored APB for a long time, but due to a lack of other games I tried it. Generally, it is a solid Multiplayer PVP Game and makes fun for a short period time, but it has too many negative aspects in my opinion.  Pro's:  -Kind of GTA online clone.  -You can play and level Cops and Criminals.  -The design option is very big and funny. You can spend hours creating Vehicles, Style etc.  -Nice Cities with good spots and nice surroundings.  Con's: -As always in such games there is a ton of aimbot users most on criminal side in my opinion, wich ruins balancing totally in many missions. -Missions get very boring after a couple of days, cause they are always the same. Its only 4-5 different mission types on each side. -Most of the random players are not cooperative and not playing in team. They dont use chat and running like chickens into the other teams. Very frustrating when you have highlevel players and premade teams against you.  -For such a little online game it has way too many lags, what makes combat sometimes too stressy.  -The loading time is way too long. It needs up to 5 min. to get into the game, and you can not do anything else at this time cause the launcher makes your saystem slow, otherwise the game crashes. Thats not a resource problem its the simple game client.  -BUT Worst thing is the Pay to win! faction. Get better guns and bonuses from the shop or get 50% more than all other players. WTF...Without premium this game is nearly not playable. For example with premium I did level 4 Factions in one day to max, without it I did not even get one of them two levels up and got so much less money, that I can't get any better weapons.   After a week of playing alone and with freinds, I can only say...In the end you have to do frustrating and boring Mission farming....the design option is funny and fight can be thrilling sometimes, but after a couple of missions even that doesnt make it better. And thats the point where I stop playing such games.  If you like playing games where free to play means 'Counter strike' with frustrating and boring farming 80% of the time, and if its not bother you that a game has so many aimbot players, try it, otherwise leave it be and do something better with your time.     
1060	1	a	Very nice Graphic and background i like game but need uptade case add ant weapon to sell steam Market
2305	1	a	very fun game. the connection does get a litte ehhhh. but other than that its great. i hope that they put money into making the servers and connections to the game better. if you are reading this, hit download.......
6385	0	a	I played this game a while back, I wasn't very impressed. You have to pay to get almost anything, whether it be a gun, clothes, or cars. The game was filled with hackers. The only pros were the amazing customization, and the large open world.

2183	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
8725	0	a	I used to recomend this game, but after 6+ years of playing it there has been so little change that i can longer recomend it. Maybe after the fabled engine update comes out (whenver the hell that'll be) that might change. But with the ownership of the game currently under the money milking copany G1, nothing will happen. There hasn't been any change in 6+ years, the haker problem is getting worse, half the weapons are unbalanced, and there are many more issues that make this game hard to enjoy, even with all of the potential it had
8071	0	a	Game is hilariously broken. It's fun to play for a few hours while you marvel at the bugs. The 'physics' are absurd and worse than anything I've ever seen in a commercial game with this many players. You can tell they have the basic weighting or friction completely wrong within the few seconds and the masses of most objects are hilarious. Boxes work like baloons, etc.  Also funny is that civilians inside of cars you steal don't actually exist. So once you rip them out of the car they simply stand there and then disappear. You can cancel some actions in odd ways as well. This means you can begin stealing a car, stop stealing it - doing so causes the civilian driving it to disappear.  I find myself not playing the game much because it's more entertaining to see how they messed up things.  Oh look at the ground when you get a chance you'll notice it has lots of weird glitches. They didn't get the shaders for the ground right...

1484	1	a	1900hrs on my Crim and I still play regularly and have fun setting my own goals, and with the engine upgrade just around the corner and with it the console release I find my self more and more excited for the future of this game.
8280	0	a	I played APB: Reloaded via the Gamersfirst launcher and at first I was in love.  The missions were challenging when you had to fight other players, the customization really let you show your creative side, and the music was amazing. You can even hear the music of players driving near you.  But the rental guns really got annoying considering the original APB had permanant weapons. The cops vs robbers theme was cool but the ratio is way off, there are far more criminals which makes sense considering criminals can make money about 4 times faster than enforcers.  Also there is or was little in terms of balance. You would often see gold ranked players matched against silver or even bronze players, resulting in a massacre.  All of the above was tolerable until the Armas Market was introduced. Offering permenant cars and weapons, all of which are slightly better than their 'free' counterparts, the Armas Market gives spenders a noticeable edge and ruins the game in my opinion.  Imagine getting matched up against a player, you have the exact same guns except theirs is cash shop (you can tell by the gold gun icon) and they have nearly tripple your firing range and seem to be able to kill you in half the shots despite wearing heavy kevlar.   To sum it up. APB: Reloaded is a relaunch of a failed P2P game with beautiful graphics, great character and car customization, and a horrible cash shop model. Due to the Armas Market, I cannot recomend this game to people looking for a good PVP mmo.
3804	0	a	My relationship with APB: Reloaded has been like how an abused spouse comes back to her partner. You come back hoping everything has changed and the game has gotten better over the past year or so, but all in all it's still just a bad game deep down inside. Bad analogy? Let me explain why.  APB: Reloaded is fun but extremely hard to get into due to the fact that when you start out you get paired with people WELL beyond your skill level, and not even the tutorial city can prepare you for the assraping you recieve once you get into a real server. Going into a Bronze server? Prepare to get rekt by recently upthreated Golds and on-the-border upthreating Silvers as you get called a noob and eventually booted for not knowing what to do. Sure, Golds are banned from Bronze threat servers, but the only thing they have to do is de-threat to silver and it'll be no time before they start pounding your innocent virgin pucker back to submission. The thing that really shines in the game, however, is customization. You can customize your character to your hearts content to make them look like the baddest flipping cop or the finest looking criminal, but unfortunately that's where the positives really end. Missions are tedious 'capture the flag', 'hold the point', and 'team deathmatch' modes, weapons that are way too overpowered to be in the game are easilly obtained throughout the first few hours of the game, and 'pay to win' elements are painfully obvious. Furthermore, the community and social aspects of the game are absolutely horrible. The only thing you'll see someone type most of the time in-game are either insults or hacking accusations, and most of the time your teammates will be doing solo kill runs while rarely focusing on objectives, inevitably resulting in loss, and consequentially, more rage. Compared to the last year, opposed from previous reviews by others, hacking has (almost) been abolished by Reloaded's new anti-cheat engine, named 'FairFight'. Whether hacks for the game still exist or not are unknown, but you'll rarely find a person using a script in the game nowadays, lest they get caught, publicly shamed, and banned by their automatic anti-cheat program.  I've installed APB two times, and tried my hardest to get back into it. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but unless you've got some balls and a good trigger finger, or a team of friends backing you up, it's not worth the download. Overall, APB: Reloaded has not aged well since it's initial release.  Summary:  Gameplay - 4/10 Community - 1/10 Graphics/Visuals - 7/10 Replayability - 5/10 Immersion - 4/10  Overall: 4/10
407	1	a	Just buy GTA.
1061	1	a	:) 
5013	0	a	pls buy this game deepsilver and make this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ great again
2291	1	a	got my account back! very happy
2467	1	a	This game is really fun, if you enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row series, you'll LOVE this game, it pure multiplayer meaning there is no 'bots' only other players to fight against. Give it a try. It's free!
3637	1	a	Absolute garbage.  This game is the tale of pay to win tryhards vs. trolls who do not give a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and with hundreds of customization options under your belt, trolling could never be easier. Nothing quite as satisfying as running over an anime pay2win roleplayer with your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car plastered with the image of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the hood.  It's fun to an extent but don't expect depth unless you've got hundreds to spend.
2704	1	a	i wish i could play it all i get is a black screen and i can see the main menu flashing.......i think
6459	0	a	i like it how is in the free to play section
9910	1	a	I totally recommend this game. i know like most free to play MMO's there is a cap on what you can do with the free account but its not low enough to really bother you. I personally like the crafting in the game. i like the fact that you can find nearly everything you need in the open world or collecting it from things/people you killed. Most of the players are really friendly and willing to help! I do think that the tutorial should maybe be a little longer as i dont think that it really explains enough to understand the game when you enter the world. I also love the fact that you get to craft vehicles for transport. The fact that the map is sooooooooooooooooo big i mean its huge. AWESOME game. One of my FAVS!!!!!! I really dont think i have come across anything that i dont like about it :) 10/10
8188	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
2577	1	a	it is a good game if you are not old enough to play gta giving nearly the same gameplay 
1864	1	a	I liked APB.. but didn't continue after a couple of plays.. simply becuase it lacked controller support. There were a few features I would have liked to have seen also.. radio stations, more solid single quest modes and not just MP, because if your just starting, single quests is where you learn your tools to play the mp. a more detailed customisation of char. but I havent played in around 2 years so maybe they have these features now.. if your Kb&amp;M and stuck for cash, it's F2P.. worth a tryout, if you don't like then no harm done.
7266	0	a	I did a previous review explaining why this was still a good game and delved into the issues with hackers and defended this company and game full heartedly. I then got false banned for 'hacking' under the new FairFight anticheat system, along with many others.   This was just another slap in the face by the ironically named 'Gamers First' company. Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken. This is not okay and this company is scamming players.
3249	1	a	very fun open world game kinda like grand theft auto!
4066	0	a	A great potential â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up by its devs. What a waste of a good game...  EDIT: came back after 4 years to see what happened to this game.  Less players, more hackers, more pay2win G1 slaves, the same exploits and bugs from 2012, a few new guns and cars but not new gamemodes or important updates, ... My suggestion: Don't even try this game, it was a bit playable back in 2012 but now it's just impossible.
2892	1	a	This game is incredible! Comparing it with GTA online, it's a peice of poop. Why?  Charactor creation! You wanna have your character musclar, well OK! You wanna customize your hair style! No problemo. There's so much options for your character! Change cloths, customizing cloths,...etc  Vehicle customizing! Put at least 25+ decals for your car! Even a starter car can be majestic if you know how to! You can also DESIGNER your decals and vinyls with the designer!   Awesome weapons! You can mod the weapon too!   Good friend systems!   There's also some bad things: The match making system. Sometimes you are a newcomer and then you have to face P2Ws. There is a small amount of hackers.  You don't get to change and buy cars right in a mission district. You have to go to the social district in order to do that. I know there are some poopy PCs and it takes 10 minutes to go from a district to another.   The vehicles have too big limits. There aren't boats, helis and jets and tanks. I want it to be in there.  We all want to set our own bounties. I don't like how I have to get killz until I get to notoriety 5 (and that's nearly impossible xD). I want to be able to set my own bounties and the amount of money you get out of a bounty is too small. We definitly want to set 20k bounties.  SUMMARY  Pros: Awesome customizing systems Weapon modding Friend system!  Cons Too much P2W. The worst match making system. Limited vehicles Non-setable bounties.  -----&gt; Game score: 7.1 GOOD
6076	0	a	DONT BOTHER SPENDING YOUR MONEY, I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE AIMBOT HACK MYSELF FOR A TEST RUN.... GM'S AND ALL OTHERS DONT CARE WHO CHEATS, THIS GAME HAS GONE TO â¥â¥â¥â¥... SAVE UR TIME &amp; LIFESTYLE HABITS.
7002	0	a	Ok... APB Reloaded is a peculiar game. It's fun and completely awful all at the same time. The most controversial aspect of this game is it's usage of the Free-to-play model, a significant change from it's original incarnation as a subscription based game. However, this model always begs the question: Do you actually have to pay money to play this game against other paying players? In this case, the answer is unfortunately a resounding 'Yes!!!' Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money. This type of F2P model is horribly unattractive to me. If you offer a game for free, don't restrict the fun to the people that play.
8674	0	a	Needs Admin every time, very suspicious     4/10
1845	1	a	They've apparently quit with the Pay 2 Win â¥â¥â¥â¥ so it's become a fun game again
10436	1	a	If you are a person who likes big open world games where you can do whatever you want, then I reccomend this game to you. After the little introduction to the game you begin on your journey to do whatever you please, like to become a bandit and steal from people or to be someone who collects medicine to get money and such. I really like this game and can be fun in group play or a little chillax type game. There are some problems with the game and the owners don't seem to update/change much anymore but hey, its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free big open world map where you can do whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you want.
142	1	a	Yo. I'm a real thug freal ma negros, and this game just brought about bad memories. One time I was flying around in my direct replica of my own personal drug dealing van and i saw this kid. his name was masterrapist59xXZeldaFanXx and he wasn't joking about his name. His knowledge of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Zelda was out of this world. But then it hit me: my friend's car. It broke both ma legs and then he honked his horn at me for hours and hours, but I refused to leave, for I am the dominant male. Then I went and begged mhy mommy for money so I could get a permanent gun. She said 'YOOOOO CUT IT' and stabbed me in the stomach for the second time this week.
10355	1	a	I thought the game has some real charm to it. Despite the high level of people who comment, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about how hard the game can is (if you can't follow basic instructions then you should be playing on a console, not a PC).
6936	0	a	This game is a pay to win ClusterFork.  It's not enjoyable, and in no means can I recommend it to you and feel good about doing so.  In my opinion, I'd say avoid this game, it's not worth the time.
4122	0	a	If you are not willing to spend $1500.00 on the game then dont get it. Its a P2P community where the kids cant earn anything so they steal their moms credit card and buy all the more powerful weapons.   While the players who want to play without putting any real money into the game have to use crappy guns with crappy accuracy, and the only way to get anything decent (Which you can only have for a short period of time) takes months of grinding. Ive played this game for 119.3 hrs and only gotten just over $17000.00 ingame cash. Which doesn't get you anything good if you were wondering.   This game is a waste of time and there are many other games out there that beat this one in overall performance and quality of the community, I give this game a -100 out of 10 due to its lack of free to play compatability ingame and its lack of a mature and friendly community, all I see in this game is a bunch of rich 10 year olds who get their parents to give them $500 allowance a week to spend on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  For your own sake and the sake of you're mental ability to play and have fun.   Dont download this game, play minecraft or something, which overall is a million times better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ show.
8918	0	a	If you like fallout, please do not play this trash. This is a terrible, broken game. Hasselhoff does not approve of a game that does not allow to actually edit audio. Some woman was talking and it was like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 1000 decibals.

4313	0	a	Great game to play if you are not planing on spending money on it. If you are planing to spend money on it DONT, waste of money and its just fkin squeezing money out of you with no rewards for you.
1443	1	a	11/5 IGN-   This game, was probably the best game of 2089. For the first ten minutes, i had a nerdgasm over what you can do in APB, now that i realize, its more than a game, it's a deep meaning of symbolism. Looking at that black screen for a 19 minutes made me realize, that its not even worth downloading. Its so good, even steam wont exit out becuase APB is bullying Steam, and wont let it close out, ovevrall, 1492/420 - IGN.
4654	0	a	Laggy and bad. 2 thumbs down
2153	1	a	Great co-op Grand Theft Auto. But bloody hardware requirements... :(
2288	1	a	Ok so I have been kind of addicted to this game for over a year now. Its my first venture into a true PVP game. The community is ok once you find other players willing to help teach you the game and play along your side until you get the mechanics figured out. The match making is pretty bad and there are alot of people who play in zones where they don't belong (you will have issues with getting killed alot and not getting many kills when you start) out once you figure it out and you keep in the back of your mind that this is only a game and you don't rage quit it turns out to be pretty good.
2703	1	a	While playing APB when I did, which was at least a year ago, maybe more, I had fun doing so. In my mind, when I was playing APB Reloaded, I thought of the game as gta online (when it didn't exsist) and I had fun playing it. Though I was mainly robbing places from a day-to-day basis in this game and running from cops. I had fun doing so. I never spent actual money in this game, as I don't for most other free-to-play games. This is a Third Person Shooter/MMO. You can either choose to be a Good guy (Cop) or just a regular criminal. I only played as a criminal but I have heard being a cop can also be fun. And of course this game is a lot more fun to play with friends, but you can always make friends in the game too, I did a little of both while playing this. At the end I grew out of APB, it wasn't a bad game, just moved onto other games mainly because I wanted a feel at other stuff. But when I did play I went on at least three times a week, and eventually got the fast car I wanted to get. Though I wish I could've obtained the Tommy gun, I could not mainly because I didn't really want to spend real money in the game. I would suggest this game for people who are into third person games, gta, or mmos. If you're into buying stuff in the game, and designing your character when you start off this could be for you, though (at least when I played this a year or so ago) didn't have the best character creation. You'd go to a seprate server to purchase clothes, cars, and etc. And you couldn't get the really cool stuff unless you use some of your real money. With or without the real money it is still fun, so play how you want to play. This game is worth checking out, but that's my personal opinion. From my experience of playing this, as long as I did, I would rate this a 7/10 It lacks some things, but there's good things in the game too, hope you liked my review!
6738	0	a	I got this game and every time i played the game would freeze about 4 minutes into a district. It also made me have problems with my computer and i had to call the company's support to fix the problem. I do not recommend that you download or play this game unless your sure it'll work good on your computer.
6177	0	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥
2599	1	a	This game so good
669	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES

3126	1	a	why can't this game ever be good? 
3787	0	a	I spent way to much time and money on this game for nothing. Constant cheaters. The creators promised improvements such as an engine update. They have yet to bring updates. They only create new weapons trying to bring in money
1553	1	a	Great Game I recommend for everyone to play. :)
3840	0	a	Played original APB under RTW, loved it.  Played APB:R under G1, loved it, for a while.  Pros: Fun game play Fun customisation Can do stupid things like jump a car to the moon Fairfight catches most cheaters Varied Mission objective locations   Cons: Removed the cops and robbers themed missions, now its just 2 teams of gang bangers Rented guns - because who dosen't like to come back to a game after a short break to find out all your stuff has expired? Griefing, by open world players... alot... Punkbuster - Possibly the most overzealous anti-cheat ever made. Poor car handling all except a handful of cars ar elike driving on ice. Armas - Want that cool gun that you saw in a film/game? sure you can have it for the low low price of another AAA game on release day. Random weapon nerfs for existing weapons - Remember the old 5 shot kill FBW that existed for 2 years? not anymore. Joker boxes - because gambling at the tracks is bad but its ok in a game. Broken Armas weapons on release - Whisper? OCA-Nano? Trouble maker anyone? Lag - This happens alot. Poor optimisation - yeah the game dosent run smoothly and will fps spike even on a GTX980ti. Low population - chances are you are going to get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you consecutively by the same teams over and over agian. Toxic community - if you beat someone you are a hacker, if you lose then you are garbage scrub. Engine update Soonâ¢ - This was announced back in 2014 I think? Sqeakers - 70% of the people that play this game haven't even hit puberty yet despite the M mature rating.  *Devs constantly try to hold you back by preventing skill based/intelligent play*  Scout rifle jump shot - gone, QS3 sniper quick switch - nerfed, shotgun consistent damage cone (from 2 years back) - nerfed,  CQB joker carbine - nerfed: Ghost shot every other shot,  strafing run oscar - nerfed: Ghost shot every other shot, Utility sniper DMR - nerfed and split into 2 different guns,  tommygun with muzzle brake - nerfed Conc thats that 1 shot on a perfect prime and direct impact - nerfed ntec that used to be accurate up to 70m out - nerfed STAR that used to be worth a damn in CQB - nerfed Cobra rifle - this was never relevant to begin with despite the hefty $30 price tag ATAC - was good on release but nerfed very shortly after PMG with Ex mag3 - nerfed,  Mid air rocket launcher artillery - 2 second charge up timer nerf. Pig stungun + Perc nade - still broken. This list goes on...
6937	0	a	Dead on GTA 5's arrival.
7692	0	a	Used to be a great game years ago, but now it's complete ****.
3870	0	a	Well, where to start...  1. The game offers the possibility to adopt different gameplay styles, according to scenery. 2. Besides having, and of course, claiming to have a 'good system' to prevent cheating, there hasn't been a day that goes by that one does not come across, either by using macro's or simply Aimbot. 3. The cheating 'community' for this game is also constantly developing to overcome the system in play (check U n k n o w n C h e a t s ). 4. Crying, crying, sobbing and sugar... A typical found combination during gameplay, due to the dominant age of the players involved (mainly from 13 to 17), resulting in ghosting missions, chat rage, abusive use of /report commands, and so on. 5. Random stutters (from 1 to 2 secs of freeze) during missions, occurring in a spontaneous fashion. 6. LAG. Yeah... since 2012 I must recognize that it has gotten worse.  7. Just to end on some 'good terms': create or join a clan or simply play with a friend. This game becomes more appealing that way and creates a better experience.   Overall Rate: 5/10
2900	1	a	APB Reloaded is an Open World, GTA-like, cops vs robbers style MMOTPS. You get to rent cars and weapons for 10 days minimum or buy them permanently from their overpriced store with real money; then you get to customise those cars with parts you earn doing missions or if it's bought from the overpriced store. You can also customise your characters extensively, dye clothes, design patterns, use them on your clothes or even on your character as tattoos or just add them to your vehicle. About the gameplay: it's purely PVP, meaning you will be fighting against other players, you will either have a lot of fun or get pissy for being accused of hacking/name calling, but that's a bit normal for PVP isnt it. All that being said, game still has some bugs and an imbalanced system that sometimes favour one side more than the other, not to mention the 'pay4win' thing, the overpriced and overpowered market weapons and such. Despite everything the game is quite fun and the best in its genre.

9086	1	a	This game has been out for a while, and, compared to other currently active MMOs, Fallen Earth does fairly well.  If you like the post-apocalpytic theme, crafting a variety of items, shooter action-rpgs, and playing with others, you should enjoy this one.  The aesthetics are pretty good, the equip-able armor and weapons are all visible on your character. The music and sounds are decent.   The controls are easy to familiarize yourself and, like most MMOs, the beginning tutorial is extremely helpful in establishing your bearings in the game world. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs and their mechanics.  Crafting is a very fun part of this game if you are into that - you can craft almost anything you see in the game world (which beats having to spend your resources on merchants. Within the first 2 hours I already was driving around in my own ATV. The gameplay is pretty good, however, it still remains fairly buggy in many areas. The AI has godlike sensors, able to detect and chase you across the map once you have aggro'd (hostile interaction) them.   Grinding in this game is actually pretty fun considering that the rewards are very reasonable and the variety in missions is very, very good - they aren't 90% fetch or find quests typical of many MMORPGs. Combat can be weird and clunky at times, and hopefully this will be improved, however, it has been a long time and these problems still remain.  If you can look past these bugs, and enjoy grinding and crafting in the post-apocalyptic setting, then give this game a try.   Recommend.
3079	1	a	Nice game, i've been playing as a criminal
8694	0	a	The game is fun but the community is mostly consisted of a**holes :(
7144	0	a	somethings wrong with it. wont let me get on or make an account
3869	0	a	Is a coooool game but u need to pay for 90% of game ( tunning car , good weapons etc )
9973	1	a	Starts off kind of boring but gets fun in the mid game
7034	0	a	Never spend money on a free game. If you download this, you'll either have to buy your gear or spend hundreds of hours trying to keep up with the frequent spenders.  This game is realy just fun for the moment, not a long term game.
5153	0	a	I can't play the game because it says it's running. I wouldn't reccomend it only if you know how to fix it or you wanna be frustrated
3704	1	a	Alot of pay2win elements, and there is no chance for you to win against players who've spent over 300$ on this game, cuz they got more 'power' cuz of bought modifications and stronger weapons.  Balance is not always good, ''mostly''   I've played this game around 100-200 hours and i do recommend it if you are in state to give money to it and kick some asses as a pay2win player.
1052	1	a	You all have got to try out this game if you haven't yet. It is Awesome!
2520	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
6224	0	a	You guys think this is like GTA? I got ONE answer to that. No
7825	0	a	Can't play this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game for more than 2 minutes without it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crashing. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Waste of my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time and PC space.
612	1	a	So Cool Game But You Know Cheaters ...  Cheaters Everywhere
9266	0	a	this game is really horrible . Still a better love story than twilight.
9843	0	a	if you like pans i recomend u not bplay balogna bcus it if butts
5888	0	a	I'll keep this simple. Bad graphics, gameplay, customization, and community. Mostly positive? Whoever's given this game a positive rating needs to seek professional help immediately. Avoid and go play GTA 5.
6483	0	a	full of hackers
2468	1	a	this is nice game
9131	0	a	The game is all right I suppose. It is an open world game that is based around the Fallout series. Though Fallen Earth is a much more boring experience in my opinion. When I finished the tutorial, the beginning video made the game look bigger than it actually was. The graphics are terrible and the HUD was just all over the place. It was too lagy, and even on the lowest graphics settings possible for my computer. I do not recommend this game.
7120	0	a	10/10 would get called a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ again for learning how to play.
937	1	a	i really like this game but the controles are wierd and the the graphics has false advertise
1469	1	a	meh....also the nutshack is a great show
6912	0	a	Even after it becamne free to play it is still not worth it, do not waste your time on this.
5452	0	a	APB in all is a very fun game but on bronze and silver servers there are always gold players and it ends up being difficult to play. also they are a very high number of hackers on this game
10659	1	a	Very fun and addicting THEYRE GONNA PATCH IT SOON AGAIN
4336	0	a	Saints row the third, with a tiny map, long load times, confusing ui and many customization features, behind a paywall
3627	1	a	Like i love this game but YOU NEED A GOOD LAPTOP TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!! I like it this game but the sound is echoing like crazy kn my laptop! So if you have a DELL laptop just get a computer or a better laptop!
9517	1	a	can make horse go on car, go 100mph. drift and propell me and my horse at the speed of fast.  10/10 would f*ck
9582	0	a	I was all like, 'Woah, an apocalyptic game.'  Then I joined the game and was like, 'Woah, and apocraplyptic game.'  -6/10
451	1	a	really awesome but high pc requirements... cant wait for the ps4 version to come out
7449	0	a	Game controls are Saints Row II awkward, and community is full of bitter people. Not trolls trying to be funny, just bitter people.
335	1	a	IF you're willing to deal with the bugs, the lag, and the hackers, THEN this is decent free-to-play version of multiplayer cops and robbers.  Until the servers are upgraded, and the serve-side FPS and other such issues are completely ironed out, it will always be a slightly enjoyable, rage-building experience.
7639	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
10142	0	a	NAFF game, best to play Fallout 3, or something else, but not this, read other reviews for more indepth stuff.
7381	0	a	Great now with the new anti-cheat system. Still abit to laggy tho but cannot complain WAY better than a year ago.
9975	0	a	While a noble concept and interesting lore this falls incredibly short due to clunky controls and mechanics. Luckily this was free otherwise I'd be pulling my hair out now....
10284	0	a	99% of my playtime was figuring out what the problem with the launch was.
2041	1	a	It's good.
5986	0	a	im stuck in first mission.....
833	1	a	Really fun to play with friends and just fool around or get serious and have a few games here and there. Been a long player and re-discovered this jewel on Steam a while back. Too bad that the servers have gone to ****, framerate problems and the skillcap to play is just too high for new gamers to get into. Every person is a pro or either a hacker, no new players to be found. If you're ready for a hard ride and have some friends who are into shooters then go on and play this.
8981	1	a	This game is Kinda good but it is very complicated to start!
8775	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars
7706	0	a	Game sucked major â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GG pay2win, would rather play Hello Kitty Online Adventures, save your life and desk space and dont even bother installing this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. peace
7966	0	a	if u are a gangster and you pop a cap a cap in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s â¥â¥â¥ and get drunk on mountin dew then you have completed life
8374	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
9862	0	a	This game is bad, like really bad, itÂ´s so boring, looks ancient, and itÂ´s very uninteresting.
5349	0	a	Fairfight is broken, hackers out the â¥â¥â¥, and complete pay to win scheme. ARMAS Marketplace is worse than EA, Ubisoft, any of them. That's why no one knows about them, because they're so damn terrible.
3494	1	a	I actually really like this game Pro: smooth gameplay(from asus computer) Con: REALLY LONG update time (on old computers)
1065	1	a	this game sux. Go play tf2
6555	0	a	This game is a poor excuse to get money out of unexpecting customers. The game is very unbalanced, so if you wanna play a good free to play game this is not for you. Only people that pay to play/win will have fun becuase they get too beat down on the people who actually have lives. The core game play and customisation is real fun until you get into a game with people that will kill you instantly. My friend and I have played this game for many hours, yet have never found a match when you can win without paying. this game will constanly make you it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ till you give it money.
5014	0	a	Pay to win.
2718	1	a	Awesome game like GTA but the lag is very annoying so I'm not playing APB anymore but it's an awesome game.
5806	0	a	wot a peece of sheet
1160	1	a	240 hours and I finally got past the loading screen!
10684	1	a	Ah yes i remember this
10188	0	a	this game is so bad i cant stand how slow the game is its just bad 0/10
10450	0	a	You Can't Even Log In To The Game For The First Time.. How Could You Play??  -11/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥er
10408	1	a	There is MUCH potential to where this could head to. I see it happening as well.. Deserves for you gamers to give it a try for sure!
5498	0	a	this is a good third person shooter game if you like those kind of games  
5189	0	a	I was told once i'm Hacker beacuse i killed some guy with my luck. This game is actually Pay to Win, if you have money. But better don't play it in this status. Not recommended at all.
1916	1	a	Such A good game obviously it is better with DLC but good game and its the only style of game for free
2395	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
1229	1	a	Amazing alternative to gta. Awesome customization down to every single detail. 8/10 Sorry but no. So unbalanced, so glitchy. The most fun you'll have is screwing around the map killing innocent people, and trying to shoot through everybody's bullet proof glass. 3/10 Has good potential
10626	1	a	After being essentially killed by the devs in 2012 it's on its way back. The multiple classes are gone with just light, medium, and heavy with different weapon options.  The skiing and jetpacks are some of the best things ever made in a game. I say at least give it a shot if you like fps games. But make sure you don't llama grab.
10347	1	a	dont forget your password or create mutiple accounts it wont be pretty but the gameplay is good 
783	1	a	So after 10 Hours of creating my character, I join a district. After that, I saw that I needed to press K, so I did, and the objectice was close to me, (well thats fantastic) so I grab a car, drive to it and see 3 players in a car shooting directly at me, I tried to dodge, but their car squished me to a wall. I then died. Best game ever. 10/10. Brings a tear to my eye.
6065	0	a	Poor optimization
4482	0	a	This game had me REALLY exited to play, and looks cool and everything, i'd imagine it would be super fun if you could get past the stupid and very frustrating Punkbuster issues, i've spent about 10 hours trying every solution in the book and i either get 'no packet flow' message or 'failed to initalize pnkbustrb.exe' this game would be so much better if it didn't have a ****** up and lazily put together Cheat program, if i could scream at the coders of punkbuster i would
2130	1	a	its like a ex wife thats really hot, you play it for one part that turns into a addiction and hate all the other parts.
4209	0	a	Extremely laggy, and is not recommended for weak computers.
2228	1	a	This game is pay2win
1730	1	a	Even though this game can get to you it is still a fun game to play for hours. Anyone that has played it once can't stop.
1881	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
1013	1	a	A truly unique gaming experience, almost endless character and gear customization, fast-paced FPS action, and the timelessness of cops vs robbers.
2506	1	a	Pretty Legit
5545	0	a	That moment when ur teammate tries to kill u so u unload 3 magazines of your assault rifle into him and blow up a car in front of him but he walks up to u 2 seconds later and uses his pay 2 win gun to kill u in less than 1 second xdxdxdxdxd
2954	1	a	APB Reloaded, not that bad but not that good either.  You play as either a cop or a criminal and you do missions while you are able to get weapons, customize your character and hang out. This game is seen as a pay to win and there are sightings of hackers so watch out with this game. This game is fair if you actually want to pick this up as a free to play and you're new to Steam. Try it out and see what you think, I was about to not recommend this game but I did since I had fair enjoyment while playing this game
9605	0	a	Not much to say. Buggy, boring. Played with a friend for about two hours before we gave it up.   All in all I'd say this picture sums up the best part of the game:  {LINK REMOVED}  http://tinyurl.com/p5wj2jb   I want my two hours back. (Link is to t i n y u r l . c o m)
9261	0	a	Doesn't let me create a account.
3103	1	a	Makes grand theft auto look like sesame street
1523	1	a	A very good game. Recomanded
7214	0	a	God Awful. I have been playing this game for like a month or 2 and it f***ing sucks. Sure you can customize weapons and cars n' stuff but the online gameplay just sucks. I ready in and wait 30 minutes for a mission and my other teammates wont even do the mission, they kill me when I try doing something(friendly fire X_X) and tell me they're 'priming'(from what i heard is not doing â¥â¥â¥â¥ untill a police force comes to the scene) and yelled at me for being a noob. I as a rookie game developer tell the developers 'you're doing great with customization, but PLEASE set up a better matchmaking system'. for the players i say 'Just play GTA Online, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ just sucks'. oh and one more thing developers 'WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY RENT GUNS'. thank you
1514	1	a	only if there was a medieval game like this
3876	0	a	super pay to win and new players have no chance at all. if you havn't already be playing this game for months don't even bother with it it will only frustrate you 
8035	0	a	Alot of hackers , couldn't play or do a thing -.-
7937	0	a	Crashed in the first five seconds. 10/10
4802	0	a	Pay to win.
5716	0	a	many hackers in this game wich make it bad game and unfair game and hard game to play
252	1	a	I never thought I would see A game where all characters look like young meth addicts...  Still fun to play though!  7/10
64	1	a	Apb Reloaded = A lot of lagg even with a gtx 750 2gb ti OC 40fps. U need a Nvidia Titan black. 16gigs of ram *Its a must* A i7 Extreem edition K version so u can overclock on max. And then u can play the game with 50-60fps. U need to play this game atleast more then 1000 Hours to Counter the hackers with ur legit skills*Most are closets so u can outplay them with your 1000hours of experience* Unless they get mad and put wall hack aimbot all on. btw the new engine upgrade is fake so people stay longer at the game and spend more money.  WELCOME TO APB:R
6387	0	a	Do not be fooled by this game and it's positive comments. It sucks.   First, you create your character with a very glitchy and unreliable character creator tool. You are then thrown into a random place with a tutorial, a gun, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ clothes. After that it's pretty much play missions, try to get cash, die from people with OP weapons, and repeat.  Not that great, extremely frustrating, MASSIVE P2W, but playable. 5/10. Uninstalled D:
1107	1	a	Long download time.
7605	0	a	Game is okay, nothing spectacular though
9211	1	a	After wandering the wasteland of Fallen Earth for more than 200 hours, thought it was time to give my opinon. There is a staggering amount of quests, mutant creatures, and crafting. Being this is such an awsome free mmo, I would rate this a 9/10. This game has been around for years now, and still has alot of people coming back for more. The graphic are smooth and realistic. A variety of sound, grapic, and other setting options. The help chat is one of the best I have ever seen! Hard not to get a help queston answered by more than one player. The ability to ride horses, atv's, and sweet cars across a very large map makes me want to get 3D headset. If there were air and water craft, I would probably never want to stop gaming!?.
4299	0	a	This game is absolutley â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.
911	1	a	The game is great! i love it. The only things i think it needs are  -first person mode -melee weapons (knife, bat etc) -a selectable option that makes you pay %200 more money to buy a weapon permanetly instead of for 10 days -mission select and mission vote (to vote for wich mission you want) -more damage on headshots (I REALLY REALLY WANT THIS PLEASE ADD) -when you get to natoriety 4, enforcers (any enforcer) can kill you -more opertunities to get weapons permanetly without using G1C (level rewards, mission rewards etc)
8736	0	a	My review for Title Screen Simulator 2016  Step 1: attempt to launch game Step 2: get directed to splash page begging for Facebook likes Step 3: game crashes Step 4: repeat until uninstall  
1620	1	a	Well, When I Play this Game, its fun As Hell. Its Free to Play, so Dont even look at those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reviews 
10668	1	a	Extremely Fast Paced First Person shooter with jetpacks boosts and LArge slopes .   Try it it is extremly fun .   Capture the flag is the main game mode   Also offers Many other games modes to play from
7700	0	a	its a stupid game wont even start up dont get it its not worth it
5664	0	a	10/10 would bang, fun to not play... this games sh*t
10172	1	a	after playing for 41 hours i can tell you that this game is epic! theres soooo much to do like go hunting doing side quests or working towards gathering richers or building an atv or motorcycle or spending your riches on worthless thing when you start out just like i did   you can sit for hours killing and scaverging just to sit for hours and craft   but be carefuyl when further out in the wastes there are many CHOTA(chidren of the apocolipse) fortresses or towns out there and some of em can be full of dangers and well hundreds of CHOTA   overall i would give 12/10
7105	0	a	How this game still has ''so many'' people playing it ?
5886	0	a	Why do i keep â¥â¥â¥â¥ing playing this
7431	0	a	i hate this game
5270	0	a	i didn't play apb fo a year, today i started the client and all i had to update was a patch 60MB big. New Content is real!
6314	0	a	i'm ABSOLUTELY not recommend this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, cause: i was on lvl 20 and the game dropped me with much higher lvl players (over lvl. 150) . The players playing like 6 yrs old kids.. : shoots their teammate, can't play in a â¥â¥â¥â¥in' team..  WORTH MMO IN THE WORLD
8127	0	a	Go and â¥â¥â¥â¥ your self with the nvidia phisyx
4851	0	a	i playing this game for 4 years ' Non steam ' .... i can say apb is a great game but devlopers so much love money.they ONLY add new weapons and cars and etc to REAL cash marketplace... 
8966	1	a	Watched cooking videos, got freemium.  10/10 - IGN
2548	1	a	This game sucks
6896	0	a	I will say this, I wanted to go back to this game after playing it during my highschool days and dropping it after say a few months.  The game is amazing on customization as in beautifully stunning in the fact that EVERYTHING can be changed with your character (Clothing to body) and Cars and guns (albeit with premium limitations on designing) but beyond sitting in the hub far from the sh!tstorm that is the open world of APB:R, there isn't much more to be said about it, if anything I would rather pick up the game just to twiddle with the fun customization stuff you can do than hoping and praying that I can have a fun firefight with all kinds of players that isn't laggy or one sided on who has a sniper/rocket launcher or an ARMAS bought gun.
10263	1	a	What is Fallen Earth? Fallen Earth like a MMO Metro 2033 only minus Russians talking in English with silly Reznov voices.
678	1	a	mmm thats preety good 
2638	1	a	After 1h of gameplay this game ill make u bored =d But atleast its for free!
5813	0	a	First of all, this game isn't free to play, though if you do play it like it is, you will be very disappointed, because you'll be overpowered by almost every player out there in the game who either has too much money on his hands to splurge on a game or has no life and has been playing it 24/7 for the past 5 years, because that's the amount of time you need to put in the game in order to be on the same level as rich players and actually somewhat enjoy the game, so it's more like Free to Play Like a Noob Unless You Pay Up, One point to note is that the mechanics of the game is subpar. Graphics is average. Gameplay is so repetitive it hurts and is unbalanced to boot.  The pros of the game would be rich customization, but you can't fully enjoy it for the aforementioned reasons.   The conclusion is that the game was made for simply making money and the complete disregard for the community makes it virtually unbearable, so If you're a masochist or dumb enough to pony up the devs or take part in their little schemes for earning the G1C, this game is for you.
4120	0	a	Game itself is pretty cool its like an open world online GTA but i have to warn you.. Don't even think about playing it untill another developer manages the game since the current one is f*cking greedy as f*ck while not caring about the game itself at all.
7428	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
10040	1	a	Love this game, it absorbed me, I got lost in it for over 800 hours. Unfortunately though, I couldn't adjust to the PvP.  There were the regular PvPers that I could generally take in a fight, but then there were elites.... and a large portion of the games best late game content is in PvP zones which was both my favorite part and my least favorite. But if you're up for a challenging PvP late game, and an immersive dark wasteland environment with good stories and a well thought out crafting and market system, then this is a good game for you. :)
4607	0	a	The community of this game is absolutely horrible. The gunplay is some of the worst I have seen. It is extremely pay to win and it should be redlighted from steam in my honest oppinion.
7761	0	a	my pc meets all requirements but it still doesn't work
2014	1	a	i remember playing it a while ago, its amazing, it takes you HOURS IF NOT DAYS to costumize your character, then longer time for the vehicle and so on. 
715	1	a	i rate this game john cena out of 10. this game is like bilcosby its cute for one night and then next thing you know you get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and loose all the money you own and your viginity
5025	0	a	Worst game  dont waste ur time downloading it  best thing is uninstalling it
2121	1	a	Played it and I really enjoy playing it with friends, however I wish there was more to do.
5154	0	a	I'd rather rip my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and feed that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to a dog than play this game.

4282	0	a	Not even a single real content update since launch. Just silly guns who are recycelt from resources even the cars+kits  However, this game isn't pay2win. But 'Gamersfist' has horror politics. They just deliver guns every mouth witch are Overpowerd, so everybody goes buy a gun for 40â¬(no kidding). After some time, they start nerf these guns + release new one staight up.    Enjoy the recycle simulator 2010-2020
10673	1	a	love the game just from looking at the trailer
2111	1	a	worst game ever, totally sucks :3
10789	1	a	No other fps like it. Massive learning curve with a huge pay off. Such a fast paced game there is no time for toxicity making it eaiser for starting players to play without feeling judged. 100000 out of 10 would play again and again and again.
7708	0	a	Went and played this game for 20 minutes, lags like sh*t and gives me a punkbuster kick within 5 minutes. -&gt; DELETE

1931	1	a	Very fun and i love the carachter costumization :D better thatn sims
6712	0	a	+ Fun game  - Pay to win - Bugs - Lots of cheaters - Server wide lag on a weekly basis for multiple days
3198	1	a	APB is the only game that I never get bored of. I've been playing this for about 3 years now, and although I don't play it all the time anymore, I still jump on every once in a while, and then remember how great this game is.  They are always adding new stuff and its such a simple idea. You do missions against other teams over and over, but due to the size of the map, the weapons availalble and how fun it is, you never get bored. Get this game now
8312	0	a	My ex boyfriend had me play this with him. I'm not really into shooter games or anything except Half Life and similar stuff, and back then I didn't even have interest in Half Life. So you can imagine the culture shock I went through when I finally installed this game. He had us play as thieves and I must say now that I look at it it's like an MMO version of GTA. For me, everything we did didn't sit right with me and every time we encountered anyone else all they wanted to do was either shoot us or run us over with a car. From what I remember you're stuck being a gruff looking human and the only customization after making your character is expensive clothing at overcrowded stores. And from what I could tell, everyone played the game like an idiot, unable to drive without aiming at people/fences and if they were the police, all they did was shoot at you until you were dead. I don't even know if that's how they're even supposed to do their job because I never got the chance to play as one as I got fed up with trying to play something that I really didn't like.  TL;DR: If you like to go 'LOOOOOLLLLL â¥â¥â¥' then this game is perfect for you and you will find everyone else in there to be like you. If you're any other person with an actual sense of decency, you more than likely will hate it and its community.
1106	1	a	Eh. It's ok I guess.
9634	0	a	So after taking the time to make a cool looking character, I was introduced to the horried controls of this game.  NOT being able to strafe, turn and move backward/forward simultaneously, makes this game completely uninteresting. Which is pretty sad, because the vids and screenshots of this game looked like a lot of fun.  The biggest problem is that I never made it out of the first room you start in. I go to the terminal and it tells me to kill the dude on the right, so I do that and then come back. It then tells me to go and activate some drone terminal or something.  Well there's a terminal there alright, but it doesn't do anything. No button prompting, no hints, no nothing. After walking every where that I could, it dawned on me that I had to activate a terminal to continue. A terminal that is not able to activate.   I give this game an F.  This could be a fun game, ya know, if it were like, playable in some way, and if maybe the devs get their act together.
9166	1	a	Best free to play out there, tons of stuff to do.  The combat system is simple, but you get what you pay for.
8107	0	a	boring game , cheap gta rip off
7995	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
8263	0	a	The game was fine at first, But then it got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. When you are doing missions, Its super unbalanced. 2 robbers vs 5 cops. Unfair. Also it shouldnt be 'Noobs vs Pros'. The cops are always super OP and the criminals are weak. And the loading time is terrible. I have a great PC but it take ages for this game to load. It doesnt even have very good stuff in it so it isnt worth ut.
4784	0	a	The game was built on a great idea, throw a few dozen players into a few square kilometer districts where they either become vigilante cops or hardened criminals. They than get into small groups with random players and go play various missions against the opposing faction. You start small; you're poorly dressed, drive a weak two door car, and have an assault rifle and pistol. But you team up with your friends, than suddenly a couple hundred hours into the game you're roaring down the street in a pimped out muslce car, hitting the Nos, with your teammate standing on top, shooting opponents with a rocket launcher.  Sounds fun right? Well too bad, because  Gamersfirst  Moneyfirst repurposed this game into a fully-automatic â¥â¥â¥â¥-You-Up-the-â¥â¥â¥-and-Steal-Your-Wallet Machine. The in-game guns you can buy are pretty damn good. But despite what the stats say, the ARMAS Marketplace guns (the guns you pay for with actual money) are most certainly better. The matchmaking system was coded by a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ monkey. You're a silver threat Rank 85? Awesome! Here's your teammate, he's a Green threat (lowest threat in game, you don't even START at green), your opponents are 3 Rank 255 Gold Threats with ARMAS weapons. Good â¥â¥â¥â¥ing luck! I wish I was exaggerating that last bit. The game has a pretty limited selection of vehicles, and even the fastest car, even with all the right mods and Nos, can only reach about 55mph, due to engine limitations, or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ netcode, idk, either way,  Gamersfirst  Moneyfirst doesn't care enough to fix it.  But I will give it this, what it lacks in actual fun and gameplay, it nearly makes up for in customization. This game has, by far, the best character customization of any game, ever. I'm not over exaggerating that part either. The customization is absolutely superb. Vehicle customization is also pretty damn good, as long as you pay premium so you can put more than 7 decals on your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing car, trust me, it's hard to design an actual squad car with less than 7 decals.   In the end, unless G1 sells the game, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing done. I don't see redemption for it anytime soon, and most other players see it the same way. Don't bother with it, it's near worthless without going p2w.  Besides that, my friend in a dump truck launched my ambulance 200 meters in the sky, 11/10 APB: Space Program
326	1	a	Its a great game. Except for the hackers. Get rid if the hackers completely, and it would be alot better.
880	1	a	APB:Relaoded is kinda full of bugs and flaws, but its highly addictive and tons of fun. Its one of the best games i've ever played and one of the worst at the same time. I totally recommend it for everyone who like 3rd person shooters, since its for free and u cant do anything wrong on something thats for free ;)
2764	1	a	very fun game minus tryiing to get mney oterwise I reccomend this game
2261	1	a	Hello,this game is awesome,the customization is epic,it's like an gta 5 for free ;D
3837	0	a	The real winners in life are those who bought this game for 50 â¬ some years back. Congrats!
1361	1	a	dont play it 
2839	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ with this game, free to play, and cool
6296	0	a	Quite literally the worst game ive played. The best part was when i uninstalled it. If you want pay2win simulator here you go. If you dont, then dont touch this thing they call a game.
5359	0	a	Just another P2W games you have to pay to look goth and what not   GG Gaben GG
9954	1	a	 Scratches the Post-Apocalyptic Itch
2594	1	a	This game has excellent customization, not even AAA titles come close to the amount of customization this game has. Too bad the core game is not as good (a bit pay to win too). Had fun with this though, you really should try this game.
3630	1	a	I'm generally very picky about games, but this I've enjoyed for 4+ years and still to this day enjoying it! Matter of fact, I bought a gaming computer just to run this game the way I wanted to! No regrets at all! Great and amazing game!
5694	0	a	The game seems good when you first play it, but slowly turns into you needing microtransactions to get better gear and personalisation options, seems like the game would be better if they were not trying to steal your money constantly.
3758	0	a	'Engine Update this year' -2013
4671	0	a	Pay to win, seriously. Also, matchmaking is trash.  In order to get matched against players you have a chance against, you constantly have to backwards-grind to lower your level.  You gotta pay money for good guns, good cars.  'Customization' my â¥â¥â¥, you gotta pay for any good customization items too.
6570	0	a	will not start
3050	1	a	APB. Thats it.

1489	1	a	You can drive a garbage truck and destroy anything in your path. Me and my friends took 4 garbage trucks and wreacked havoc all over. 10/10
473	1	a	This is a great game to play with friends as the missions require teamwork but the missions can still be enjoyed by a single person. APB is a game that it is easy to mess around with and still earn (in game) money eaisly. For a F2P this game is balanced.
8195	0	a	i can play the game but it keeps crashing and i dont know why
3906	0	a	This is a review of APB Reloaded  Or atleast it would be if i could actually get on the game... I keep getting an error saying my physx has a problem of some sort ive tried the suggestions and this still does not work i regret wasting 30 minutes of my life on this trying to get it on the actual game instead of trying to sort out launcher problems. I only downloaded this game to prove to my friend that I would not like it at all and by the looks of the dlc it seems to be more expensive than other triple A titles what look more pleasing, fun and have probably got better gameplay overall, however for now and forever this will be my personal opinion on this game, and anyone whos having this problem then please please please dont waste 30 mins of your precious time.  The DLC is worth Â£107 overall wtf!?
7936	0	a	pay to win trash
4334	0	a	I really can't say I would recommend this game. The biggest issue I take with the game is the fact that the majority of the equipment you can purchase in the game (guns, cars, etc.) are time-based/temporary if you purchase with in-game currency. If you want to keep the weapon for good, you have to purchase it with real money (which defeats the purpose of this game being  F2P ).  To make matters worse, I would run into griefers/hackers every day &amp; decided the game just wasn't worth it after a short amount of time playing it. I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest &amp; I decided I was done with it.  If you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers &amp; hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...
2942	1	a	Great game but it was really laggy for me so I didnt have the best experience,but it was still good
10328	0	a	monotonous and boring. also a cash cow pay to win.
10815	1	a	Great game, have had a lot of awesome times going a bazillion sanecs and capping flags, or just fooling around with shrikes. It's a real shame HiRez gave up on it, but it's still a fun game
5901	0	a	I hate this game so much...I keep crawling back tho. I dont recomend this game
4447	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this garabage
6471	0	a	Are you serious. Game cant even run for 20 minutes before it crashes my computer and I'm forced to power cycle the damn thing. Graphics are at lowest of low settings too. As low as you can go even though I can run the game at higher settings....still crashes. I was pretty excited to play this game too. Well thats gone now. Back to Arma 3!
357	1	a	This game is sooo close to what i can find an open world, trird person shooter, car jacking, and most of all custimization gotta love that. This game is clsoe to me having gta V, so what am i gonna do?  -Download  -think of the things i can do while it downloads  -when finsihes get hyped  -and play
5272	0	a	Words can not describe how â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is. Actually they can:   - horrible netcode - horrible engine - massively P2W, like it is a joke how they jew money out of people - hackers - non-existing matchmaking - real fu.king retar.ed community  Utter trash, don't even bother downloading. Potatoe / 10
995	1	a	Yes, i still love this game... even tough i am bored of it, for a few reasons, well first i'm really tired of the same aspect of the game beign, just getting called to a mission and do the objective, and or shoot enf/crims it's fun for a few hours, but noticing that im not the only one noticing that this game get really repatitive, and has pay2win weapons and other such of quipment, other then that, unlocking things is cool, but i wish i could unlock some of the lastest things, and all the new things like clothing items, and much more.... I my self, and are one of the most people that play this game, morally for the cuztomization purpose. Pretty FUN game, if you are new, also can be funner, if you accually play with a friend.
7198	0	a	This game is really bad.
5111	0	a	I've been on and off this game for about 2 years. To me the game overall is a decent idea and the customization is the best i've seen compared to any other game. The things I didn't enjoy about this game is the matchmaking. Dispite what happened in the past with the flood of aim bots and hackers; The match making is also broken.   Why is it that a gold player can just decide to join a bronze server and womp on all the new players and get just as much money as they would in a gold server? THEY SHOULD BE AUTO KICKED, Threat levels should mean something, not just a color where they recommend you go.   fix this, or your game will crumble.
10441	0	a	i can't get in the actual game so i dont recomend it so much
5413	0	a	the game sucks. it says i played for 1.4 hours. the 1.3 hours was spent creating profiles and installing. i thought the whole idea of steam was to centralize online games for computer gamers?  anyway, i played for 5 minuted and then deleted it.
1597	1	a	APB is a great game and is quite fun.
8602	0	a	it's like when you click the video with the really cool and interesting looking thumbnail only to realize what you came for is not actually in the video  its just pay 2 win, you cant buy a gun permanently without a trillion coins or real money same with everything else  summary:  https://youtu.be/Qg4SVGFbPZk?t=65 
1404	1	a	Its great, i love shooting peoples face off :)
2964	1	a	Looks so real
3241	1	a	When I first started playing APB few months ago I wouldn't have recommended it as it was a lot of gold tier players stomping me every mission but they have added new match making which has me playing against other silvers and I'm actually having fun. The combat in this game is very fast paced like GTA 2 or 3 in fact specific weapon types are made to run and gun rather then usual iron sight shooting I'm used to. The cars are also realy fun to drive around and the physics of crashing them together can be hilarious at times especially with the heavier vehicles.   I should note that if you don't have the paid subscription (premium) that the very very good clothing/tattoo/body modifications are severely limited to the point where you will won't get the crazy details you see in most screenshots. The same applies to cars though even with subscription it is still much more limited then player models.  The game is free to play so you have nothing to lose to just jump in and run over and or shoot people to see if it's something you can play for a while there's no hidden pay wall or 'pay 2 win' though they do sell guns and some are a lot easier to use then the default weapon but skill plays a lot into it.
5450	0	a	You know why.
9753	0	a	There are lots of hackers in every pvp area.  Don't try to speak to GM about it. They won't listen.  Maybe playable PvE-Only but gets repetitive and unrewarding very soon.  Abandon it and wait for a private-server.
5826	0	a	q: why would you play a game that needs over 900000 bytes   a: to wase cash on and lose tons of performance and storage 0/1000 will never play this game again untill they won a alien ware gaming pc. |:/
3203	1	a	I get in game do a mission and get rekt by kits that paid for guns that are better using their moms credit card. 10/10 would get rekt again
8481	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ONE OF THE WORST GAME EVER.  I JUST CANT PLAY THIS. BECUZ SERVER IS BLOW ALL THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TIME

5201	0	a	STAY AWAY!!!!  This game have a really newb hostile community in its core.... **********************************************************************  I have been playing this for about 4 days now. In those 4 days i experienced,  a lot of hostility towards new players from highlevel players.  I was trying to get my wife into the game too, so i went afk for about 15 secs (in a mission) because she needed my help. when i came back to my screen, i had a really hostile whisper from a team mate, because he had seen me stand still.   I ignored it and resumed our mission, now that same guy started to TK me, and when i asked him why he did that i got 'because you are dumb' Again i I ignored him and tried to resume the mission, but he kept TKing me for the rest of the mission.  Now the mission was over and freindly fire went off, the guy started stalking me and yelling stuff about my mothers â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the global voice chat.  Another episode i had, when i joined a mission was another highlevel player, he started whispering me about my in hes opinion sucky weapon choice. I replied that i just took down 2 of the enemy team with my sucky gun.. but i was assured that it was luck.   After a while the same guy is telling us newbs in the team chat that we should â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the the bronze district and ruin the missions there instead.  Yet another episode was yesterday, when i joined a mission with 3 gold ranked players, all from the same clan (WASP) one of them ran me over with hes car, i asked him why he did that, he replied 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, you dont look where you walk' so when tried to return to the mission objective they all 3 started TKing me, and i was told that they liked to shoot low lvl players, so they ended up hunting me around the map untill the mission was ended.
9038	1	a	 Really good and exquisite gayem 
1058	1	a	It is so so.
3125	1	a	The customization on APB:R is insane, you can make your vehicles and character look any way you would like. For the most part the missions are fun if you can overlook all of the server lag (Joker-East) and the OP weapons that you can purchase through the in game market with real money. I have put a ton of hours into this game and as much as I hate playing it with the server lag/hacker issues it is still a really fun game to play. *I am not calling everyone a cheater either but there are a select few that still roam the joker server every now and again.* I would recommend this to anyone that was wondering about it because it can be a really fun game to play if you really have nothing else to do.
6089	0	a	Would be fun if balanced, but its not.  Pros: Its pretty almost like GTA, and you can drive a car YAY! And also pay money to look like, well a bunny, or something stupid like that. Thats it... Cons: Why a bunny? Because nearly every firefight ends with you being bunny hopped at close range. How many seats does the car have? WHY would that matter if you can simply ride on TOP of the car? Shooting at a car is fairly useless, tires dont blow out. Driver cant be killed unless they exit the car. You can then just bunny hop on them. The whole game is build around buying stuff on their annoying marketplace. Why give the player a choice of 5 FREE GUNS for 10 days, if they can simply go to the marketplace and try a BETTER gun for free for a day, theres more then 10 to choose from. The NPCs are useless. The only missions you do are random ones by selecting READY, that is not an RPG. Servers are unbalanced. Guns unbalanced. Half the time getting into your OWN car takes over 3 seconds. People shoot a grenade at your feet and arrest you, and you can do nothing. You play for 10 seconds, and then wait 30 seconds to respawn. There is no teamwork at all, just rushing the enemy 'beach of normandy style' till they die from being overwhelmed. Loading time is HORRIBLE, connecting to server takes forever, just to find out that there is only 3 people there and you need 4 to play. Weapons are kinda sad, lots of choices but are basiclly the same, you buy ammo manualy, cuz they gotta drain your in game money on something I guess. Thanks a lot. Sorry im tired of typing...
9282	1	a	An interesting post-apocalyptic game. Usually when I think of post-apocalpytic games I think of a generic zombie shooter, so when I went into Fallen Earth, I was surprised (Granted there is a part of the main story where they kind of have zombies). Fallen Earth is a open world MMORPGFPS. It's alittle more hardpressed towards the survival aspect then the shooting aspect. Crafting is a big thing in Fallen Earth and is probably one of the funnest thing to do. Almost everything you can get, can be crafted. From weapons, armor, and even your ammo. Sure you can buy most of your items from the auction house, but there's a certain feeling of just crafting it yourself that is so amazing in the atomsphere that Fallen Earth has created. The combat is a twist between a FPS and a TPS. You can shoot in a third person camera view but I perfer playing in a first person view, Although it feels just a tad bit off and could use some work it's generally pretty good. Although not the most innovating or new, that's not really what Fallen Earth is about. In my opinion Fallen Earth is about the grander feeling of the atompshere of a Post-Apocalyptic world. Not saying anything about it being a hardcore role playing game but if you can get past the generic combat, it is quite an intriguing game. Theres plenty to do, and even from a story perspective, with all of the side quests and even the main quest is kind of interesting, it caters to a wide audience. If you're looking for an openworld MMO that focuses on elements other than combat, than look no further.
8511	0	a	If you're thinking about tryin this game, I would not jump in at this point because the learning curve is a bit too steep to compete with the players who have been on for a while.
10695	1	a	the games isnt working fix it
4754	0	a	Cops 'n' Robbers... sounds great doesn't it. The concept that hearkens back to boyish childhood games. Yay!  But this... *sigh* I can't recommend, even if it is free.  Gameplay:   Yes, there is a wonderful range of customization to your player and vehicles, but dress up dolls does not make for a fun game.  The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.
5653	0	a	Fantastic cheating simulator
1970	1	a	Really good game that you can solo or play with a buddy.Pretty detailed and will keep you shooting for days. Best played with a friend
2403	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
10663	1	a	Really Fun game
5691	0	a	worst game ever, looks just like gta. but its really more like minecraft.
6425	0	a	The game used to be good but now its another pay to win game.
145	1	a	Very gud
9479	0	a	The game is pure awesome in a Fallout 3-like world (with a bit of green) with Multiplayer. There is also first-person view mode by using the Mouse Wheel (or pressing F9), so you can play it like an FPS game as well as the usual Third Person.  There is about 6 different *big* Regions to explore, Missions (some can be done co-operatively), Person Vs Monster with set PVP Zones shown on the maps, Factions, Crafting numerous items such as Snipers/Pistols/SMG's &amp; other stuff, Scavenging, Leveling up, Auctions, use Vehicles like Cars/ATVs/Motorbikes/Horses, Clans, Riots, and a whole lot more.  I've played this game for at least 4000 Hours by now (even donated at least $80), and I must say it's a very good Free To Play Game. If you donate at least $10 by buying something from the Marketplace, you get a LOT of extras for being a first-time purchaser.
10256	1	a	Yes it is a very fun game and adventureous.
2137	1	a	Pros! 1.) Open World 2.) Game Currency 3.) Missions 4.) Carnage  Cons! 1.) Long loading screen 2.) Not enough cars/ cost too much 3.) Not balanced teams
1779	1	a	damm it if you dont have this download it its free but kind of pay 2 win 
7540	0	a	APB... APB its, its amazeing! The customization, The Detail. It had me playing it for hours. To the point where I wouldnt even know the sun has passed and the day was over. Though the community can be harsh. Thats not so bad. All the guns are ballenced, So i thought.  All the guns you get (In-Game with out paying) are ballenced, I am even talking about you annoying OSMAW, You are balenced as well. The thing is, Some guns in the 'ARMAS Market' Are just plain, stupid. I mean like the universal ATAC or the NANOS. Those wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt mixed in with the commonly known 'De-Threaters'. People who lose matches (So they may join bronze servers, Though they may be a gold threat rank) often ruin the fun time, Win or loss, i may be haveing with my friends. It is just a major killjoy when a bronze comes in with a ATAC and NANO, His skills are just way beyond me or my friends. As they reck havoc on all the missions, till they hit gold. Just to dethreat back to bronze, to repeat the process.  Another problem is the rerolls, People who make new accounts so they wont have to 'De-Threat'. Rerolls are quite common. As the fact i am a R212 and a R009 will join and kick me and my teams butt... Alone. With no help. Not saying they hack, I know some ppl have VERY Good skills on games. It just makes it hard for me to return to such a beuitifull game. This legit  'One of a kind'  game. It saddens me about all the problem this game has.   Lastly my ending result for this game. Sadly would be to  AVOID IT . It is very fun, Very Addicting, Very... Frusterating, Screen punching frusterating. Unless you are a natural born shooter. Evrey one I have talked to agree, that g1 (The Game owners) only have this game running because it is a 'Legit' Money farm for them, All they do is care for the money. I mean look up the prices for your self. All and All this game would be a five of ten for me.  Thank you for reading this review on this wonderfull game. 
3233	1	a	I love this game and would highly recommend it to my friends (if they're not already playing it) and want to delve into it more, unfortunately, I need to switch over to a 64 bit system in order to play it properly.
1849	1	a	The game is great and i love to play it

2515	1	a	There aren't enough isocubes for the population.  Mute the game though, or you will feel the need to hand out more agressive justice (and choice of verbage).
10018	0	a	i started the game up about... 2 years(?) ago and it automatically set to 800x600 resolution on my 16:10 monitor. Also craftable horses and clunky UI. graphics are a bit... 1990s. lighting makes the game look blurry.
6390	0	a	This game is a huge money grab.
9599	0	a	I played some of this game it was confusing and the intrest did not last long. If u want a wasteland/apcolypse game get fallout or something else.
2571	1	a	it is fun play now it isn the funist one yet
3008	1	a	Start game. Be immediately greeted by the sales pitch and storefront splash page. Uninstall.
5650	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bad, pay to win, hackers and cheaters run around as they please, cops dominate the criminals. what i mean by that is if u are in a crominal and 1 enforcer spots u while he's in a party of 4 there squad will stun u with u having no hope of getting your stash back. the fact a enfocer can stun someone and completely take them out of the fight for 30 seconds is rediculously 1 sided and crominals have no special tools of the sort. This basiclly tells al new pllayers to pay as enforcer and if you want to have fun catch a criminal in the act and get the jump on him before he even knows that he got caught so you can steal all of his stash. In reality the is enjoyabllle with my friends but the game coulld be alot better if playes that played longer didnt have such over powered guns making it that much harder for casual or new players. if they dont fix some of these balancing issues I don't see much of a future for this game
875	1	a	played a little could be butter 
10083	0	a	This game needs a lot of work before it can become even close to being good.
5084	0	a	i accidentally left this game open while sleeping
1237	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
5255	0	a	I want my 2 hours back ! car driving 0/10 guns 3/10 graphics 4/10 pay2win cheaters everywhere please don't download this game...I repeat do not download this game ! do you copy ?
9853	1	a	I like this game, it's very easy to play.
3942	0	a	This game.........you want to love playing it..........you really do, and dat first, it seems like you can actually be good at this game, but then you run into the gold players..........the ones who have all the best equipment, bought straight from the dev's, paying real money to have a significant advantage over everyone else, and it doesnt matter that you are at the bottom of the chain here, a bronze level player, they can just come right down and play against you, making it impossible for you to win a single mission. Then there are the hackers, they are out there, for sure. Aimbot is a definite obstacle, so for now, I say dont waste your time playing this, the game was a great concept, I still wanna play it, but until something is done about balance, about pay to win players, and about hackers, I cant even look at APB anymore....... R.I.P APB, i can only imagine what you could have been...........
6676	0	a	worst game i have played in along time, it may be free to play but the driving control is just well â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game is PAY TO WIN 100% im not saying this because im a noob or whatever but the fact that you cant kill anyone your own level or below or hell even higher with standed weapons, you simply have to buy better weapons off there store to win
5897	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks dickhole i cant play it wont load â¥â¥â¥â¥ u steam!
3733	1	a	no headshots&lt;3.
4555	0	a	This game had potential,till i found it was pay2win. I would rather play TF2.
7453	0	a	The only fun this game is for screwing around on a terrible gta clone.
4843	0	a	The system requirements are insane, and even on a decent system it will lag and sometimes crash.   Also the last time I played (2012) it really was pay to win. Any decent weapon you would only unlock for a couple days before it re-lock itself, and you wouldn't make enough money to keep up with it. Then you'd go on some mission and a guy who spent a bunch of money would just 1 shot you with a rocket launcher while you had your starting pistol and nothing else. I hope they improved this since then, but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Overall it has a lot of potential and the world is chaotic and fun, but the points above make me not want to go back.
7012	0	a	Just another P2W game...
3867	0	a	money money money money mooooonay, MOOONAYY
6423	0	a	it crashes alot
8375	0	a	I will say this game has the best customization in a game I have ever seen! but as for gameplay goes, driving in this game is horrible it's like every car is on ice being a free game as well has invited a lot of hackers to play and the game is just dead now.  Don't waste your time.
10421	1	a	Great game. Fair for F2P Graphics - meh  
54	1	a	This is a fun game so much to do i find it fun to witness crims and robbing stores but overall i recomend this game
2103	1	a	Nice game (sometimes) I spent here a lot of hours. :) Cheaters can â¥â¥â¥â¥ off you very fast and it is wasting of your nerves.  So think twice are you sure that you want to try this. :)
9791	0	a	This I can honestly say without a minor fragmant of doubt, is the worst MMO I've ever played in my entire life. I say that with full knowledge of Quest64.  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tutorials, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics.  It wouldn't update at first no matter WHAT I did. Then after working my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥ off it finally decided ot MAYBE just download. Don't bother with this, it looks good from the pictures, but let me tell you, when a game let's you go in first person, BUT only when you back up into a wall, your game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (Due to alot of backlash towards most of my reviews because little kids can't seem to understand what an 'opinion' is and get angry and overreact at something sticking out of the pervervial line, I must leave a warning. Thanks kids!)  This is my opinion, I make these reviews to get my opinion out there, if you disagree, I'm not saying my opinions are fact, in which case, no need to get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off at something as trivial as a 'review' or 'opinion' I have an opinion and a mind that proccesses things and I like to let them be known rather than sheltered, weather it be good or bad. I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion on anything, if you disagree, calmly, put my thoughts into perspective, and see if you agree or not. If you don't want to do that and would rather rage over my opinion, then don't look at reviews, you're not mature enough to handle them.
5958	0	a	i hate this game to many errors 
4134	0	a	Awesome game for customization , you can design the craziest thing you ever imagined! But awful for pvp matchmaking in my opinion. Not to talk about the cheaters of course.
10807	1	a	Brazilian and redditor infested Pay2Win garbage   Hardly even qualifies as a videogame now
6195	0	a	In the beginning i had no idea what to do, so i just walked arround random and killed NPC's. eventually i knew how to ram a shop with my car, and i earned money. with this money i couldn't do much. so at the end, i had 1 hour of fun and now every time i play the game (which is not often), i just get an overload of boringness.  EDIT: i have removed the game of my PC, and it seems to be les than an hour
2046	1	a	APB:Reloaded is the game you keep going back to but at times you don't know why. All in all it is a GREAT game, but sometimes the Community can be a little-a lot rude and the company definitely takes their time with the less important things to fix like the Threat and Matchmaking system.  There are Hackers and Macro users just like any other game. There aren't as many as there used to be but when they do appear now, they're just blatant.   If you're going to start the game off without a friend I would suggest starting off as a Criminal. They can Ram Raid and mug for cash, but as an Enforcer you can witness criminals doing such things. That's a gamble though, with premium and effective play Missions are an amazing source of money. But like I said, as a newbie Ram Raiding would be the way to go.   Asylum and Baylan Shipping are NOT the place for a newbie to be, Hang out in Financial or Waterfront until you get used to the game and unlock some more guns. Play around with your mouse sensitivity until you hit the sweet spot. Guns like the OCA (SMG's) are great starter guns along with the Ntec and the Star 556 (Assault Rifles).   Some people will say Pay 2 Win exists, I don't agree because the Oca, Ntec, and Star are some of the BEST guns in the game that you can get at a very low rank, you will unlock slotted guns for mods to greatly increase the performance or unlock guns that already have mods installed that you cannot change.   Aside from the bad things about this game, it's a great game. I give it a 4/5 for functionality, 2.5/5 for Community, 5/5 for Gameplay, and 4/5 for Story.  
1744	1	a	punkbuster and pay to win
5481	0	a	Don't bother.
8669	0	a	Pay2win, car controls are garbage, extremely CPU and Memory intensive for very poor graphic quality. Enforcer criminal catching functionality is extremely unrewarding and labour intensive.
5762	0	a	when it first came out i loved it, though i could only run it on 10 fps., now several years later with a new pc i tried it agian, and i have never been so disapointet... when you are new to the game you join pvp games where your teammates are just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as you are, but your opponents is insanely high rank and ofc. also pay to win so even if you snipe them 5 times in head before they even see you, they just turn around and instagib you with ump or a handgun. so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken because of some greedy developers!
9265	0	a	good game, no multi lanuge, to much bugs, looks pay to win, uninstall best way
9189	1	a	play this game not because it's fun but because I say so.
7243	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars

4375	0	a	I have about 12 hours of playtime of it on my account. They're all wasted on trying to start the game. Best game 1889
8724	0	a	the game is great when the devs cared. they promised the pc community an updated engine of the game . still never got it all they want is more money and there goes their loyal players. the EU got the engine upgrade which makes me believe they don't have enough funds to make an engine upgrade to the US since they stalled it and recently came out with the xbox one version of the game. makes me believe their going to try to milk money from the xbox version and upgrade the US engine with that. this game is struggling to survive against GTA. this game has potential but its help back by a crappy dev team that only fueled by greed. they are also not so transparent about anything , its clear and thats why people left this game. the game is not bad if your new to it, but definitely don't waste your money here its not worth it, i made that mistake and regret it. game is worth playing though lots of fun especially with friends.

7851	0	a	Alright, so I downloaded this in 2 hours. I was all happy about playing. Started playing, I loved customization, but then, when it came to playing, it was horrible, Enforcers are OVERPOWERED, with the stun guns, it's impossible to play. Don't waste time. Play some real things instead.
7177	0	a	There's Hackers everywhere, pay to win, people with auto aim mods and I get banned for cursing while these kids walking with moded guns. Dont play this unless you into getting destroyed by hackers and paying players.
2238	1	a	Nice game, still playing it. Playing this cuz cant buy GTA V... and its fun
10725	1	a	Shazbot Simulator 2013 is an amazing chronicle of the true story of Shazbot and his friends, the Sand Rakers and those other guys. Tennouttaten.

6970	0	a	this game is like no other game thats i have ever seen befor this game has so many hackers so many glitches and so much profanity its a shame to call that a video game i was very interested in the game and was very very up set i couldnt progress because its such a mess in that game and i hope any parent that sees this game does not buy it for there child this game need to be banned. this is y people are being bullied and pushed around this game is garbage.   p.s. SUCH A SHAME
458	1	a	Great game but get ready to get ur â¥â¥â¥â¥ kicked. Many overpowered enemys. This game leads you to buy packs and stuff. HIGHLY RECCOMEND ONLY IF YOU PLAY WITH A FRIEND!
10352	1	a	Good Game. I Just Think It Could Been a Lot Better. :)
5553	0	a	This game is horrible because there servers lag and there game lags for no reason with the best ping.There moderators are trolls i played the game for 3 hours then a moderator bans me permanantly for no apparent reason i didnt get and email of why i got banned i didnt do anything wrong.
7904	0	a	Spent '9.8 hrs' on this game, apparently. Only to figure out that my computer can't play it.
7855	0	a	Waste of time
3646	1	a	I guess im the only one who likes this game? I just drive around the city really.
5067	0	a	Might be a good game if it actually friggin did something when you clicked start, super awesome.
20	1	a	APB:R Is a truly outstanding freemium game, You get the large choice of trying to keep peace and order as an enforcer, or burn, smash and wreck the city San Paro. This games offers a new level of customization, you cannot only costumize your self, but your cars, clothes, spray, music, and more.  You will be able to enjoy this one of a kind urban freemium game to the max, even if youre a F2P, Because P2P called Premiums ingame, only get 25% bonus on their income from missions and misc, aswell as their reputation.  This game is highly enjoyable with a friend, and there is plently of room to freeroam in the streets and highways of San Paro.  Criminal: Ram storefronts, Mug people, sell cars, deliver goods, or cause a random destruction! A criminal's limits of income is his fear of being witnessed by any enforcer.  Enforcer: Pin down the Criminals as youre slowly stalking them, and as you see they get more and more dirty cash on them you witness them the last secound to take their loot and return it as edvidence for a big reward. As an enforcer youre not 'allowed' to drive down neutral npcs nor destroy the enviroment such as a mailbox.  The Graphics: The graphical level of this game is also at its max, you can any time turn them down/off in case your computer sadly cannot run it fully, but everything in this game is beuatyful and highly detailed.  Weapons: You will get a free permanent weapon called STAR 556 its a lovely riffle, fully automatic and well balenced, as a secondary you get to carry the Obeya FBW, and there is two other ways of gaining new weapons by Leasing or Purchasing from ARMAS(APB:R shop) By leasing a weapon up to 7 days or use a (sadly) large sum of your money on some permanent weapons.  Vehicles: This i cannot put down good enough but the cars are one of the most enjoyable features in this game! Theyre each very unique and offers a great pleasure as youre driving them around in San Paro, with a friend hanging out of the window or not :)  Enviroment: In the streets of San Paro, you quickly figure out where to stay when youre ramming, or where to stay if youre mugging, and the same for enforcers, many enforcers have their little 'route' they travel to see if anyone is witnessable (Means the criminal and enforcer get to battle for the dirty money). San Paro is a beuatyful city offering many wonderful places to visit, either youre at a dark alley runnning for your life, or at a contacts place having a blast.  PVP!: This game is purely based on pvp, but not only do you need to focus on other players against you but also those who are with you because know what? FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON! :D that feature is out of our reach and we will have to deal with it, I am personally loving that feature as the game pushes you even further to take caution for your enviroment.  Overall: This game is far beyond my belief of a good freemium game, but its balanced alot and well done! few for and against  +PVP +Cars/Enviroment +Costumization +Wide amount of weapons be it leased or purchased. +Open world, freeroam +Balanced freemium gameplay, no-one is TOO overpowered *cough nano,colby,csg.*  -Threat, once you reach gold, youre forced into suicide to regain your silver title. the reason i will put this here is. A gold can only join gold. but a silver can join silver AND gold, and bronze can join bronze silver and gold. -It can be boring to play alone, but as youre going into some missions you will be paired with others.  Last thing i want to add is the community, it can be different from each day but MAINLY people are incredible, ive met a handful of people ive grown a care for. Thanks guys If youre interested in playing with me as such make a Criminal on EU1 and join me :)  I will rate this game a full 10/10    
10739	1	a	Someday I will get an airshot  Update: I GOT AN AIRSHOT BOYS \o/
2147	1	a	Great game, needs a bit of a polish the come up to the expectations of gamers but the ideas are great! The story lacks and you just need to ignore it and continue in a rampage across the city!!!
5328	0	a	For 2 years now since i play this game, The only thing that impress me is the character customisation, other than that is all crap. You need to pay for cloths, bonus, and the thing is those premium weapon are much OP. This game is a pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
1502	1	a	  Artistically &amp; imaginatively freeing for me. You can keep scrolling if you wanna know about the PvP :P
4038	0	a	This game is A pay-to-win game, even after four years to make this game something worthwhile. Like i said, the only way to do good in this game is to dump your wallets out. Save yourself from a bad third-person shooter with bad animation, every gun is a recycled image, and if you dont spend some money, your stuck with crappy stuff. Dont get addicted, save your hard earned cash and buy GTA if you want something like this. Also it's a pain to drive any vehicle in this game and AI civilians run and scream even if you roll by at 5 mph and aren't even close to hitting them. Oh well, i guess we can keep on dreaming about that game that this used to be.

8479	0	a	DON'T GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THESE â¥â¥â¥â¥ERS  played this without spending a dime and even then the gameplay was sub-par with most third person free roam games... yeah it's free but the UI is crap and the lag is unjustifiable for a game without demanding graphics... not to mention the kind of ping type lag i was getting into servers when i have decent internet.   apart from this there have been numerous stories of people spending hundreds of dollars only to have their accounts shut down out of the blue losing all their money.   Good luck trying to appeal that ban with such a horrible customer support service.   0/10 don't do it.

10376	0	a	Can not create a character guess they dont want anymore new players.
9698	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ hole of a game is Pay to Win. The company â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the small guys and shows the subsriptioned players with everything. Nice 'Free' 2 play. They guys are just like EA
2870	1	a	this game is amazing and i love it no joke
2534	1	a	Wanna be a Criminal? Sure why not? Wanna be an Enforcer? Sure why not!?!?!? Shoot bad guys do missions rob people steal cars.... basically this is a GTA MMO. GET THIS NOW!
10175	1	a	YES! this is the game i was looking for, it is old but extremly fun and awesome but there are some bad things like its mostly pay to play so dont expect much if you are just wanting to play without throwing in a few bucks but other than that its a nice game
5421	0	a	I don't think I've ever seen a worse MMO and that's my opinion before I even get into the game. When I downloaded it the game complained it didn't know my video card and crashed. Then once I repaired the install it worked fine until I actually launched it and it's running in 800x600 with no way to change it until after character creation. Too much effort to just get in game.  in short, avoid like the plague. There's a reason the game developers went bust.
6701	0	a	Well, after playing this game for a short amount of time, and I know you will say you haven't played that long, but it is very poorly put together, and not enough time was put into missions. They get extremely boring and it is very difficult to gain money. The money isn't the issue though, it's the ranking system. It does take some time to get used to, and it is not confusing, although it is time consuming. The marketing is not well put together as well. Very inconvinient. The driving mechanics as well as the shooting mechanics aren't the greatest either. Driving is very delayed when you want to turn, and shooting is very inaccurate due to large crosshairs, even when you aim in. All and all, I'd give this game a 6/10, mainly because of the graphics being so good for a free to play game and the idea. GamersFirst definetly have something started. They just need to finish it..

3914	0	a	Pay to win. describes APB perfectly
3520	1	a	Realy nice this game i love it :3
6252	0	a	upon joining, you are put in the middle of the game. no tutorials, nothing. i didnt even find out how the missions worked. its shjt
7386	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
1591	1	a	This game will make you love Vanilla Cookies. Don't ask questions...
8474	0	a	Did not understand one thing about this game.Tutorial awful and cops keep killing new people that need help
3911	0	a	APB Reloaded seems to be a good idea on paper. What is that idea? Make an online multiplayer game that somewhat seems to be based off of GTA. Does this idea work? I'd say it's a tad mix of both 'yes' and 'no'.  To begin, you can choose from two 'factions' and these are the criminals and the police. The criminals commit crimes and work together to cause as much chaos as possible. These can be as simple as stealing a car and ramming over many pedestrians or working together to rob stores and escape. Eventually, you will cause enough trouble and then you will become a target for the cops (who happen to be controlled by other players). While creating chaos can be fun, I found myself working alone and seeing many other criminal players doing the same thing. I hardly saw two criminals working together during my playtime. Being a target for the cops isn't much fun either as the main goal for the cops seemed to be just finding you and killing you. They don't try to arrest you or anything of the sort; they just chase you and bring you down with bullets. After you die, you just respawn and do it all over again. There are some sort of missions in the game but I wasn't given the slightest clue to where they were. I found a suitcase and was told to deliver it to some location but don't expect the map to get you anywhere as it wasn't much for help.  After derping around with the criminal faction I played the cop faction. Problem is, I found difficulty in even finding my way out of the spawn area and, as stated before, the map isn't much for help. My best guess is that the cop faction patrols the city area and is given a list of target criminals to find and gun down.  Here's a short list of pros and cons that include some points that were not covered: + Vehicles handle differently in an appropiate manner + Graphics look fairly good + Creating chaos is enjoyable + Fair amount of character and vehicle customization + Basic free roaming is entertaining - Map is hard to deal with - Difficult to find missions - Little teamwork - Slight lag issues - Police only shoot down criminals - Community is known to be a little less than friendly  Eventually the confusion and constant deaths bored me and I can't recommend this game to anyone. It'll be nice to uninstall this game to make room for a more deserving one.
5492	0	a	i get an error about MSVCR not being designed to run on windows after multiple attempts at installing all the redist. packs, help? because this makes the game unplayable and i would love to have this game :(
3757	0	a	I have played this game for nearly four years and invested over 1500 hours into the game as well as a god-awful amount of money that I regret each time I spend. I have quit, come back, quit, come back, etc. in a cycle that's really hard to break. Let me just say that I am posting my review of this game as someone who has not been banned and has seen every side of the game and community.  The game is akin to cocaine, if I'm completely honest. At first it's great, but the more you do it the worse it gets and while you know you really should just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stop you can't.  Some pros of the game include the customization, which is without a doubt top notch - you really don't get much better than the customization they offer. The PVP aspect of it is, over all, fairly entertaining and really quite fun. But that's about where the pros stop.  The cons include an unbalanced threat system to determine matches, micro-transactions (that really aren't all that micro) to get any kind of good customization, cars, weapons, etc., unresponsive devs &amp; GMs (who are inconsistent and biased at best), a hitbox that is the same on the tallest/fattest character as it is on the shortest/skinniest one, an anti-cheat system that is easy to bypass and isn't consistent, and an overall toxic community that honestly reminds me of COD and their never ending comments about what they did to someone's mom last night.  As much as I hate it I will keep playing it. I honestly don't understand why. I hate the game, I hate the community, and yet at the same time I hold out that hope that one day G1 will be worth a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and actually fix the damn thing.  TL;DR: if you're not already playing the game, don't.
7435	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
6307	0	a	GTA Clone, ruined by cheats and limited missions
3849	0	a	This game is very demanding and ohh would you look at that a storm broke out outside my house,its far more interesting than this game.
9303	1	a	Had it, kinda was confused on what to do ._.. Sort of like fallout but for free??
1886	1	a	Very well made game and also can be extremely addictive,there will be a little lag now and then but its acceptable and not to bad
8950	0	a	I'm sorry but I couldnt spend more than 5 minutes playing this. The controls felt unresponsive and terrible, the screen flickered and gave me a headache, a nice 'UPGRADE NOW' button thats always on the middle of the screen. I'm going to pass on this one and never look back.
5445	0	a	After my limited time playing this game, I could give you a pretty decent and detailed review. This game doesn't deserve one. Simply: Don't play this game. The devs are greedy, the players are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, the gameplay is terribly boring, the game is just a downright frustrating grind and nothing else, all in all, only good thing about this game? You get to design things. Oh, did I tell you that you have to unlock the decals to design with? Or you could.. *Cough* pay real money for them *Cough*  Keep away from this one, it's a waste of time.
3660	1	a	My thing wont update so i cant play!?
5829	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.
9224	1	a	I don't think this is for me, probably good, I'll try it some more when I feel like I have no life...
2221	1	a	Crashing realy gets me wet, I love this game
251	1	a	Rest In Piece no Australian servers.. Get about min. 200 ping. Otherwise it is a fun game ;_;
42	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game to play, I met many great friends there and had fun most of the time. Definitely recommend this game for others to try out. I loved the customization ability this game provides. One thing i disliked though is constant lag warps, a big pain. But this might just be my problem. In addition, Gamersfirst (Aka G1) have really expensive Armas prices(where you buy in-game items with cash(Gamersfirst Credits)). Whoever, this game is not pay to win, some may say it is but it's really not. Hope this helped!
3548	1	a	I guess it's not that bad.
8718	0	a	My grandfather was a demolitions expert in Vietnam. His wife was an O.R. nurse. Other 2 grandparents lived through the depression. All this strength in my familyline and it couldn't save me from this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer of a game...  APB Reloaded is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. Yes i realize i have over 600+ hours. The only reason i do is because i was dickin around with friends.  When i decided to start getting more into it. I began to realize this has got the be THE SINGLE WOOOOOORST GAAAAAAME EVVVVEEEERRR.  The devs literally are telling you to go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself with every possible pixel in this game. I have a list of pros and cons for APB Reloaded.   Pros:  -Unsurpassed Character Customazation -Wide range of weapons to use. -Mugging and Raiding storefronts. -Massive amount of clothes to buy (ingame money for regular clothes. cool clothes cost real money.)  Cons:  Holy mother of all that is holy, where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do i begin... -Matchmaking is horrendous. -CASHGRABCASHGRABCASHGRABCASHGRAB -Hackers, botters, dirty cheap unskilled players who tbag even when they lose. -This community is such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥how it makes MOBA ragers look like â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Mother Theresa. -Only 2 maps. 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MAPS. This game has been out for over 6 years. -Completely lifeless dev team.  -Did i mention cashgrab? -No teamwork at all. -More hackers. -Rerolls. so...many...â¥â¥â¥â¥ing...rerolls. For those who don't know. A reroll is a person who starts up a new accoutn with prior knowledge of the game. Nothing wrong with that except for the fact the game is programmed for newly incoming players who just made an account and downloaded, to have whats called 'beginners luck'. Its programmed so that you will do well for a while and want to keep playing. People use this 'luck' and a p2w weapon to be unstoppable. -P2W. its so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing p2w its vomit worthy. Yet the asshats in this game seem to think otherwise. -Dirty players who purposfully go out of their way to farm kills and rank up off new players.  -HORRIBLE COMMUNITY OF HACKERS.  -Seriously do NOT ever play this game.  -Seriously.  0/10 Didn't proff read my longass review. It's the internet who cares?
796	1	a	Ok dispite of the reviews i went ahead and dowloaded this game.... It is soooo much fun probally increibly boring without freinds i always played with freinds and it was so much fun the car meachnics are great the cutomisation is great the gunplay is great the missons are ok not bad but ok and it runs pretty smooth considering i only have a gt 630 graphics card an i6 prosesser and 4 gigs of ram :D
10635	1	a	10/10
1445	1	a	very good game, no frame drops and no problems... + amazing hitreg
7812	0	a	All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is a game that invokes many feelings. Off the top of my head, I can name relentless rage, grueling dissapointment, and cocky pride worthy of a guy that just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Ariana Grande.  APB is a great concept. The backstory behind it is very deep, and the entire caracterization of the city of San Paro(however unoriginal that name might be) is very detailed and well done. It doesn't draw black and white lines: it's all a thick mist of grey, and it certainly asks you a question: are the oftentimes corrupt, control-obsessed vigilantes right? Or is it ethically correct to leave the city to the self-proclaimed renegades and anarchists, however chaotic and destructive they might be?  Remember, I'm talking about the CONCEPT here.  Because the realization of said concept is about as clear as a snowstorm in the deep ocean. The backstory and personality of the contacts and city is only presented by tedious text, mainly in the form of emails that most people just delete, or don't even bother to open. I even asked a friend, that has 20 hours clocked in the game, what the Enforcers were: he thought they were just straight-up police officers. That's just how bad the story is brought to the player.  Now for the gameplay. The core is good: Reloaded Productions managed to deliver a good third-person shooter, with interesting weapons and playstyles. The smart player that uses tactics will more often than not have an advantage over the kid that has spent countless dark nights crouched in front of his PC playing Call Of Duty, while perfecting his aim and surviving on Red Bull and Cheetos. However, like almost everything in this King Kong-sized dissapointment, this is ruined by two reasons:  1: The lag. Oh god, the lag. Unless the monthly cost for the servers is 3 bucks plus a cute picture of a cat, I cannot possibly wrap my head around how bad they are. Driving feels like standing on one foot. On a stick. Which is balancing on a banana held by a blind monkey with Parkinson. Often, during a unexpected encounter with a hostile player in the back alleys of the Financial District, I have either died because half of my shots didn't register, or I have won because my opponent's gun wasn't raised-which is a clear indication that some serious lags are going on.  2: The players. Sadly, the smart tactician is a long extinct species in San Paro, and the streets are now ruled by people such as 'Pu$$ySlayer69', 'lole_u_got_buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed' and 'UMAD BRAH??11?'. I am seriously not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you right now, I have seen all three of these names ingame.  Dare to be good, and you'll be called a dirty hacker. Dare to be even slightly worse than either your teammates or your opponents, or equip a weapon they dislike, and you'll be called n00b, â¥â¥â¥, and come to the realization that most of these people have had sexual intercourse with your mother, or that they wish you to do the same.  There are quite some topics I haven't covered, such as the hackers, which constitute, based on other people's calculations, 9,7% of the players. An alarming number, but hard to confirm, so I will leave it there. There is also the company known as GamersFirst. Sadly, these people seem to identify 'Gamer' as 'Man with a lot of money and no need for a honorable fight'. For excruciating prices, you can buy certain weapons that will shred through any average player. (Note that I'm not saying all of them are OP: a decent chunk are either reskins, or equally powerful as the in-game weapons.) The excuse 'you can get it in game too' is true, because you DO unlock modifications and bonuses as you go, but I myself have clocked over a hundred hours and all I got was a useless magazine mod and a slight increase to marksman zoom.  The customization is unrivalled, though. I have tried to find a game, ANY game, that has better character creation or vehicle customization, but to no avail. Shame, because this pearl just had to be incrusted in the (mostly) dried up turd that is APB.  TL;DR: APB: Reloaded is a great concept, that was insufficiently realized by Reloaded Productions, and completely â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by GamersFirst, after they took over the game. You could of course take a look, because, hey, it's free, but greedy business ideals have screwed over the concept so bad that the game is now singing it's dying song.
7087	0	a	wtf is this game car physics 10/10

1675	1	a	probably the most gangsta game i've ever played my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4538	0	a	The game itself is GOOD. But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.  I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.  Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement. Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.
1069	1	a	This game is cool guys
6107	0	a	As soon as i start playing the first mission, Grenades start flying onto me like they were bullets. Worst game experience ever.. Get your Anti-Cheat fixed..
3634	1	a	Love it 
4892	0	a	This game is good until it radomly puts you on missions were you dont even have auto ready up on wich if they dont fix im telling my friends who play and dont play not to play until this problem is resolved.
8751	0	a	When I download the game it just keeps on updating I wate and wate but nothing happends 
7658	0	a	Nope nope nopeeee :D but i could be bais, there was too much lag for me to play it :) be cool if there was an australian server :)
4946	0	a	Lagging Servers / crashing lobbys / payed weapons are much better then regular ones / ridiculous pricing! (one weapon lifetime 60 bucks lol) alsmost forgot something.. i wrote them ones.. they never replied. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you GamerFist
9060	1	a	I highly recommend this game to people who love roleplaying
9483	1	a	Fun for quite a while actually for a long time for me but it gets boreing after a bit (played solo most of the time)
6540	0	a	Dont get me wrong this is a fun game. BUT WAY too many hackers on here i still play it but it gets frustraiting when you get killed over and over.
1170	1	a	The best game ever made! huge customazation and alot of fun playing with other noobs :D TRY IT OUT!
9530	1	a	Great MMO, wish there weren't better ones out there like NWN or SWTOR But, for end of the world apocolypse MMO, this is still the best that I've seen. 
239	1	a	i have had fun on this game but now it keeps crashing!!! i will try fix it but yeah...
9073	1	a	yes i wood recommend this game its fun but the grinding sistom needs to get fixed and the leveling the game has lots of fun the game needs to get updated tho and like i sed thay need to make grinding skills ezeyer and the narmal grinding to but yea the game has lots of players cool items lots of quests lots of mounts to use and huge maps i cant see why some pepole say mean things about the game and no good things
1265	1	a	Great game I played it for 8h and bought vip its so fun and good def recomend
6289	0	a	Great game idea, bad base players all out for themselves, devs are just wanting money shame could of been a great game and a bigger success if it was put on the right course.
9195	0	a	I cannot comment on the actual game play because the game doesn't work. It keeps getting stuck on downloading updates and its stuck on a loop. After it downloads the updates, it restarts again and again.
7982	0	a	I tried and tried to play this game but never the less it would never play. I downloaded it, waited 20 minutes for it to update hit the start button and nothing. It just turned off. I tried again another three times. still nothing' I then uninstalled and reinstalled everything and tried another few times and once again NOTHING WORKED!! So im fed up and annoyed and completely deleted it off my computer... This looks like a really fun game but when you just wont work i cant exactly tell you what is good and whats not..  
6214	0	a	Doesn't work. It keeps going into this update window but it never plays the actual game. Waste of time downloading this...
2675	1	a	FIX THE SERVERS!!!!!! Im never able to connect.
695	1	a	Really enjoyed my time with this game. It was a ton of fun to play with buddies. However, it is greatly hindered by its F2P model, which closely resembles a pay to win format. The hackers obviously do not help either...  Give it a try nonetheless. The hacking has probably been fixed by now. Probably...
8495	0	a	Gameplay is not smooth at all, and it is unoriginal. Well, atleast I did not loose any money, time, or my soul to this game
94	1	a	Somewhat fun, but HORRIBLY broken.  Broken matchmaking, Broken grouping, very cheap overused gun combinations, heavily promotes being a horrible player and camping.  Luckily this game is hanging by a string, it will be dead from lack of funds soon.
7252	0	a	no support from the company when you lose money on a purchase do no use
8243	0	a	The player base is in very sad shape. However, the game itself is pretty dang cool. Theres just too many negatives to discuss them all in a short review. Its sad really. Once a great game, with a fair share of problems never getting fixed, took a turn for the worst. I played for a few days after quiting 2 years ago at least. And its absolutely horrible without friends. People like to treat ya like crap.
10696	1	a	Just for the record, I have played this before I made my steam profile and I invested ~100 hours into it back then.  Tribes: Ascend is very enjoyable game. Dinamic gameplay and loads of adrenaline make this game truly live up to its title; the fastest FPS in the world. Maps are well made and offer many tactical advantages (and disatvantages) as well as very intresting features which make them 'alive'. While playing, you can really feel like you are engaged in entire planet-wide conflict. There are 9 classes in game, 3 light classes, 3 medium classes and 3 heavy classes which have their own way of playing. If you are more agile type of player, you will certanly enjoy navigating rough terrain in the role of pathfinder light class (as well as snatching enemy flag right in front of their noses!). If you seek well rounded and generaly easy to play class, the soldier medium class is for you. Or if you had tough day at work or are just angry about something, you will enjoy tearing enemy base to bits in the role of juggernaut heavy class. Gameplay is, as stated before, dinamic and it is skill based. You don't just shoot like a maniac, you need to predict where your target will be to score a hit. You will always need to keep in mind your energy level and your speed - slow soldier is a dead soldier. Game is not a pay 2 win in any case, you can buy some things for real money but they are cosmetic (skins, voices).  However, Tribes: Ascend has its sad and dark side. Player base is getting smaller each day, last update was released 3 years ago beacuse the devs are (for some reason unknown) decided to abandon the game. Once ambitious, glorious game has been thrown into state of decay.  All in all, the game offers a lot, its not a mindless shooter or ultra-super-skilled-players-only game, in terms of action, fun, and tactical possibilities, there is no other game that can match Tribes:Ascend.
2924	1	a	Ambitious, that's for sure, with plenty of insane customizability, but overly-high system requirements and unsatisfying gunplay will undoubtedly see this game die. Again.
5790	0	a	This is a game where cash is king, and not in game cash, I mean real cash, I dont want to spend big bucks for better weaponry and cars, this game would be good if it wasnt this way and the dlc was less pricey more guns were available ingame,same with cars, and a easy to understand tutorial too
4417	0	a	its pretty bad
1174	1	a	Was great and gives you Tourette syndrome for the time being but after a while it gets old but it's your call I'm done with it I think...
8288	0	a	3 Words can discribe this game Pay 2 Win.. No really it's a P2W game and the weapons they sell are extreamly expensive and as far as I can tell the Devs favor on the Criminal side duo to some seriouse unbalance LTL weapons that take 8 hits just to stun a person but it takes 3 hits with a normal weapon to kill you seems a little on the BS side if you tell me. I would not bother downloading the game
805	1	a	very good game!! but almost full of hackers :)
6460	0	a	well I don't know because the game won't start, tired everything even contacted steam but it won't work. I can't help it, I don't really like the game cause I have spent so many frustrating hours on it. post if you are having the same problem.
496	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
6842	0	a	This game sucks
5713	0	a	Wanted to come back when saw announcment about new anti-cheat system. In first missions people followed my movement trough the walls, throw grenades at any of my cover spots, and vip instead of hiding was standing in the middle of the streets and killing all incoming enemies with pistol only. From any distance.  You are not a cheater? Forget about this game.
10434	0	a	It is a great game that makes the aftermat of the apocalypse seem enjoyable with your friends and other people online. This game is great on the RPG side as well as the fact that its free to play is really a good spot for those who just wants to play games without no strings attached.  BUUUUUT the gtame is dead so yeah....I wish people would've seen this game when it was in its early days...it was like the poor man's Fallout 3...Because is was FREE
3961	0	a	Although this game has lots of potential, I myself have found a few things wrong with it:  Firstly, the game is simply too resource-demanding. I myself have an Alienware 14 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, and 8GB of memory. To start with, this $1,000 laptop barely even runs this game on moderate graphics settings, forcing me to switch to low-end graphics just so the game can have a smooth, playable framerate. MAYBE this is something wrong with my laptop, but I think not.  Even playing on the lowest graphics settings possible, the game still manages to lag and otherwise have random FPS drops that would often result in instant death in the middle of a firefight. The vehicle control feels a little too arcade-y for my liking. In addition, there is a rather alarming population of cheaters on servers. Utilizing a mathematical formulaâ100 missions played, averaging 4 players to each faction for each missionâI found that over the course of those 100 missions that a total of 89 people were hacking in some way, shape, or form. If we conclude that in 100 missions that you will encounter 700 people (800 minus yourself in each mission), there is an average hacker ratio of 0.127 (12.7%). While Reloaded Production's newest Fair Fight Anti-Cheat Technology should help reduce this number, I still can see a large population of hackers managing to bypass this.  Regarding the servers, their software is outdated and faulty at best. Only the dedicated servers seem to run anywhere near smoothly, but even then their calculation systems and arithmatic formulas often result in a laggy experience.  Pros:  Decent graphics Dynamic gameplay ENDLESS character customization  Cons:  Requires a high-end gaming laptop in order to run smoothly Arcade-esque vehicle handling Combat utilizes hit-scans, which often bugs Outdated servers High hacker population  Overall score: 5.1/10.  This game USED to be fun, but sadly, they have moved away from their original roots of entertainment. The best that I can say about it is that it is merely a laggy, ramped-up version of cops-and-robbers that we all played as little kids. If you are looking for a decent F2P game, I would advise you to look elsewhere.
4006	0	a	Nice game and pretty fun to play for a while, but just as any f2p,the game does have some serious issues. In the case of apb,it's the balancing of the 2 factions,enforcers and criminals (=pigs and crims). While criminals are really fun to play,enforcers get a huge advantage over them by being able to 'witness them' and pretty much 2shot them (the combat mechanics of the game are: hold down your mousebutton,the one with the better weapon or first hit will win.)  The problem here is that the notoriety system of the game lets the pigs witness any criminal with a high enough rating. This gives cops a huge combat advantage,since you can't shoot cops as crim unless they witness you and start shooting.   If you dont mind balancing and serious hacker issues,you'll have a fun time,especially when playing with some mates.

10331	1	a	Very good game if you like walking through destroyed cities, scavenging and looking on radioactivenes mutants.
6490	0	a	It's a pretty good game, but it's the BIGGEST PAY TO WIN I HAVE EVER PLAYED. For example, it takes a while to unlock the rocket launcher. I've played this game for days and haven't come close to getting the gun that can one-shot cars. People can go straight in with real money, buy a rocket launcher, then run around blowing people up when they are such a low level. It doesn't seem fair that the people playing the game like it should be played are getting crapped on by the people who run in with a wod of cash and buy everything in the game.
1411	1	a	Love it.
6779	0	a	Succ a great game ruined by succ a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ company.
5966	0	a	By the time I had aPC powerful enough to run this game, I briefly tried several times. I was never successful at having any fun playing it even when it did run.
3229	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
2164	1	a	I really loved this game, unfortunately my computer wasn't good enough to handle any of it's AWESOMENESS...so I had to uninstall it...*sadface*
6530	0	a	I have quite a lot of hours on this game i've played the game since 2010 when it belonged to the right people people that did want to make the game amazing and it was they did succeed but the down side is they went bank robed and sold the game to gamersfirst, Why is that bad you ask? Well simply. Gamersfirst are money sucking none carrying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s bassicly, like EA just a much worse version of EA. Also the game is broken now so don't bother spending time on it.
484	1	a	What can be said about APB reloaded? A lot. I came from the orginal All points, which was a super fun game. This game sort of lives up to the orginal. Its fun, people are (sometimes) nice. Very well balanced at low levels. Customization  Pros: Customization (character/Cars) Weapons (tons) Driving Custom Decals Level system Rank system Group party Extra events Ram Raids (crimes) Faction choice  Cons: PTW golds Costly Perm weapons with extra damage Unbalanced game servers Reward to spend ratio low  Overall PTW -2 Fun +2 Customization +2 Weapons +2 Multiplayer +2 Money Ratios -2 funky gameplay -2  Overall 6/10. Not bad, not much of a free to play game.
2667	1	a	This game is pretty cool for a realistic shooter.. doing crime is fun I haven't tried the Police yet.. its a bit too hard to shoot other players and I rarly played it enough for all the space it took on my pc so i uninstalled.. it was Enjoyable tho
5626	0	a	It was a good game until i found i had over 200 computer bugs lucky Norton saved my â¥â¥â¥!
8406	0	a	A once promising game developed into a steaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ by yet another company that has no idea what its doing with its product. Seems to be a pretty common theme these days, hence why I consider this the MMO dark ages. Simply no good games to play, just a bunch of could have been decent games that have already been run into the ground by incompetent developers and greedy companies.
7555	0	a	Do not download this game, it is fun an all, but for a little, the matchmaking is terrible, you might be just starting to play, 1 minute into the game and you can get a mission vs highest rank with max weapons and such. Also, people get banned for no reason, me and my brother got banned for using 'hacks' if i'm correct in which if skype counts as hacks than thats just ridiculous. Do not recommend this, it is fun, but it gets you more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off more than anything.
9690	0	a	Well I don't really know how to start this off so I suppose I will dive right into it. This game is unfortunately a shotty shell of what it seemingly was meant to be. I didn't even play for very long before I got tired of it.   What I don't like:  Non-Intuitive Controls - Seriously, the controls in this game don't make much sense at all. This game is an MMO style game. Most MMO games use the same basic control system for things like interacting with the environment, and looting. This is fixed by spending about 5 minutes remapping the keys to what they SHOULD be for an MMO. It is almost as if the Devs had never played an MMO before to understand what the keyboard layout is. Why are Q and E mapped to 'rotate the character left and right?' What game even has those as keys? Q should be a hotkey ability and E should access looting, same with a right click.  Clunky First Person Mode - Here is the thing about making an MMO with the ability to play in first person. Either polish it to the point where it is remotely functional, or DONT HAVE A FIRST PERSON MODE.  In short, don't waste your time with this game unless the devs decide to make the UI acceptable.

Ride your hourse or your bike from town to town, looting for food and item and then buy some food or fuel to continue your journey, this game is so reality and I love it! people in here are nice, but there is some guys look like a scammer, always ask for your Steam Profile Number, don't share your info to ANYONE !!  Just try it ! And don't compare this game with fallout, they are different! just try it and you will see ! 10/10

10526	1	a	First off, I may have 8.3 hours playtime on Steam, but I have well over 1000 hours outside steam that I've built up mainly from 2012/2013.  Tribes Ascend has gotten quite a few negative reviews lately which I believe is very unfair. This mainly stems from Hi-Rez being very unpridictable and the playerbase seems to be worried they will drop the game at any time. This isn't going to happen. They released a major patch in December 2015 and have been patching since.   They removed the starting grind and simplified weapon loadouts to make the game less complex. Tribes Ascend can be very difficult at first because there really is nothing like it (well.. at the time of launch there wasn't). The mechanics take an hour or two to get used to, and the maps will take some learning to figure out the best paths to take, but after a few hours you will without a doubt be captuing some flags.  No other game has brought me more satisfaction of capturing a flag or killing an enemy. Because the controls are so obscure, when you master them and start kicking â¥â¥â¥, you really get a kick out of it. No other game will make me scream and shout with delight when it goes my way. Another fun part is that dying is okay. It's nearly important so that you can respawn and get a better path etc.  Yes, the population on the servers is a litter lower than it once was but there are still plenty of new players with a strong core community. Tribes is without a doubt in my top 3 list of all time favorite games. I highly recommend you try it out.
10055	0	a	Patch installer stops at 69 % so i can't install the whole game!  10/10 would patch again.
8397	0	a	Jim Sterling said it best... (Final score 3/10)
276	1	a	Really great game it's like a MMO of GTA where u can rank up costumize ur char,Clothing,Car everything truly recommend it to other people. And it's free to play!
10518	1	a	This game is being supported again. Tribes ascend is a game that is completly different compared to your modern FPS games. It requires lot of practice to get good at this game and it's definitely worth your time.
9241	0	a	When i first played this back in 2012, i was using an 'All-in-one' touchscreen computer, and to say the least, the graphics were not that good (on my end), but here's my actual opinion  Pro's: - The combat alright to say the least when it comes to a cycle between a fps/rpg battle system, but it has it's merits for it's time. - with the current level of graphics i COULD muster, the game's visual was ok. - The npc/monster/enemy AI was mediocre at best, but that's common in most fps/rpg games.  Now for the Con's: - The explorability was ok, but unguided in it's purpose. - The story line was (IMO) uninteresting, and lacked that edge that captured the player's attention. - The enemies felt re-hashed in different areas of the game, and it was repetitous.  Decision?  Try the game, and see for yourself. if you feel it might be a predecessor to Borderlands; then you might be right. but i wouldn't reccommend buying the dlc for obvious reasons. I tried it out of a whim, and got bored of it shortly after playing a few hours.
457	1	a	A decent game , fun to play with friends 9/10
6284	0	a	The game wouldnt get past the splash screen. Yeah I googled that you could run the exe by itself, but even then it took a very long time to actually load so I didnt bother...
5250	0	a	I'm going to tell honestly my opinion about this game . First at all i start with the bad side of this game which would be the really awful community . People take the game way to serious , a lot of bad words are getting used in the District chat, really mean people who just search for conflicts and fights. For me the community in online games matters a lot so here i can give APB between 1-10 a fair 3 and only because i met a few nice people otherwise it would be unfair.  Well from the community i can mention the 'cheaters' in this game. If you have really bad nerves then i wouldn't suggest you to play APB simply because there are really a lot of cheaters and yes im not in a position to claim half of the high rank people are using cheats but from a website called fairfight you can make your own image about the amount of hackers in this game .  So now we have a bad Community and lots of cheaters (everyday just imagine it lulz ) and we need help from the owners of this game ...Gamersfirst . So you want another reason why i don't suggest you the game? Here we go ;D  This game belongs to a company that a lot of ' normal ' people in APB hate simply because Gamersfirst doesn't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the players. If you have problems or a request you send them a email and get as usual a auto-message . It often takes way to long to get a response and you kinda have to spam(?) them till they answer even tho if they do, its just lame answers such as ' we work on it' ,or 'please be patient ' . Mentionable is their promises which they don't keep such as an engine update which was planned to be done long time ago but instead they do now interviews with their staff members , kewl huh?.  The only thing which i would say is nice in the game is the cuztomisation.. thats all to be honest . You have lots of ways to make clothings , cars and again thats it :D   At all i don't play it much but when i do its only because of my Character , i guess thats just my girlish side .  Try it out and see if you like it or not but be aware of the meanies out there !   Thanks for reading and Bye Bye &lt;3

5113	0	a	Reloaded Productions put themselves i.e. ca$h over the community, don't bother.
2865	1	a	APB: Reloaded.... Where to start, a fast action pace 3rd person shooter (Left or Right arm angle) Drive Cars, Shoot People, Collect Cash, Upgrade ur weapon/car &amp; Customize EVERYTHING! Its great game but very rage based in the fact that competition is so high.
3629	1	a	Not too bad. If you dont mind the lower graphics and no story, this game is good enough to be a substitute for those who dont have the money for Grand Theft Auto. DLC is a little expensive though.
3810	0	a	This game has been technologically stagnant for years, and hasn't (as far as I know) seen any patches that truly improved its performance. Unless you have an SSD and 8GB+ of RAM, don't even bother. Chances are the game will be nearly unplayably laggy for you, as it is for the vast majority of players.  On top of that, the game is  heavily  monetized, and takes every opportunity it can to shove all the various ways you can spend money on it down your throat.  Gamers First? More like Money First.
2907	1	a	It is like GTA but online. I don't pay for money or do missions I just drive around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not bad for relieving stress.
1551	1	a	this game is beast
5262	0	a	this game takes your money like an insurance company claims tax.
9566	1	a	Just think a fallout MMORPG... or S.T.A.L.K.E.R, or any other apocalyptic game, but in an MMORPG form. Pretty self explanitory. But i guess i'll go into more detail with my ever-so-rare pros/cons list.   Pros_  MASSIVE open world that would take more than a full day to travel from one side to the other on foot. (but don't worry, there are horses and vehicles to help.)  A bunch of cool secrets to be found.  Interesting roleplaying potential.  Cool story and factions.  (bonus!) The low playerbase gives a good feel of isolation, really gives that extra immersion of an empty wasteland on a dead earth. Though unlike with fallout, having multiplayer makes the few players you will come across, means no two people will have the same experience, and be able to meet people with interesting stories and characters and such. Makes the dead world feel all the more alive.   Cons_  Intense learning curve.  VERY slow paced leveling and such with a lot of 'go here, kill this stuff.' Though it does have the redeeming factor of traveling places you wouldn't go otherwise and seeing interesting scenery.  Not too active playerbase, but the ones that are, luckily, are usually the ones that have been there since the beta.  Old game with dated graphics and stiff controls, though it has aged somewhat decently well.  Support died off ages ago, aswell as updates, for the most part.    Conclusion_  Its an old game, but a good one, and worth the look.

8111	0	a	The game is OKAY at best. The maps are OKAY in size. The combat is OKAY. The driving is not good. The game is confusing and the overall game feels clunky and un-finished. If you're too cheap for GTA (like myself) and end up downloading this game with high hopes, your best bet is not to waste your time on this one. 
10180	0	a	Its ok, however the price of items of of merchants is way too high. The game features way too much grinding to do anything so its not worth it.
3123	1	a	Still one of my Favorite games to play, it's F2P and has lots of action and fun  Wacky physics, great gun play  Smart strategy and skill is key to become a gold level player  New players can easily dominate vets if you have the skill and ability to stay calm and play smart  APB:R atleast try it!
4739	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
4069	0	a	This game is a great concept that was executed by a horrible dev team.  First and foremost, this game is largely an FPS game; every mission boils down to a gunfight so you need guns to shoot where you're aiming, unfortunatly for APB the dev's decided to use random spread patterns for the guns. What does this mean? It means your gun will sometimes shoot straight, sometimes not, it's about 50/50. Even though the game does have a smidge of recoil, managing it does not increase accuracy or spread at all. On this fact alone you should not play this game, then throw in all the 'Pay2Win' weapons, horrendous server 'rubber-banding' (aka. lag spikes every 5 minutes), and this game becomes horribly broken and unbalanced.  As far as 'shooter' games go, stay far away from Gamers First, they are very incapable of utilizing common sense when create such genre of games.
5017	0	a	If you like playing one of the best games ever and they having it lagged server wide every 15 mins until you want punch out a dev, this is the game for you. I am literally the most calm person I know, and this games lagg issues â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off so hard I raise my voice and rage quit....... I NEVER rage quit and NEVER raise my voice. This game is literally making me a worse person. Gameplay is awesome, street fights are awesome, customization is UNREAL!! This sounds great until you lose 3 or 4 matches in a row because you are lagging for 1 min and 15 seconds you needed to tag a wall. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you devs, for making such an amazing game and then making it unplayable.
9335	0	a	JUST BUY FALLOUT 4 OR 3 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS 11/10
7460	0	a	game needs balance. ex) every bronze sever in high levelers. the goldgun code is spread. aim haker in game.  and sever is insecurity. ex) sever shutdown without notice to steam users. asia users only have high ping(150ms+).  
3693	1	a	It's a very nice game :P The Graphics aren't the best but alot of fun :D
7534	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.
7201	0	a	its a peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont play it
4639	0	a	Probably the worst MMO I've played. Actually, probably the worst game I've ever played, and I've played quite a few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my day. Let me explain.  First off, the only feature I loved about the game was character creation. So many options and the ability to adjust things to your liking without having to use presets, which I assumed a game like this would. (Judging by the graphics and how similar the characters look.) I spent around 25+/- minutes creating my character alone.   Now once I finished and chose my spawn location, I was pretty excited about getting into the game. Once I loaded, the first thing I noticed right off the bat was the graphics were less pleasing to the eye than they were during character creation. Checked my graphics settings and they were the same as they were before, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Changing them to a lower one and then back didn't solve the problem either.   You're immediately given tutorial quests which basically give you the run down on controls and game basics, but I was shot and killed before I could even finish the second list. Apparently you have the option of being or not being ready, and your decision effects whether or not another player (real person, not npc) can come and shoot you, bash into your car, or any other way to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you and your â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. I'm not sure when I became ready, was probably just an accidental setting I did while being a derp with the keyboard commands, but I wish that would have been earlier in the tutorial lists so that I would know 'Hey don't go outside while you're ready or some random will see your noob â¥â¥â¥ and kill you on sight.'   I was then asked to hijack a car and drive 500m. First, I had to hit the F key 3 times before my character would even consider the possibility of taking a car, and it took me a few times to finally hijack one because by the time I hit the F key enough times, the vehicle was driving off and my character was just standing there in the middle of the road being the prissy little â¥â¥â¥â¥ she's been since the start. Once I finally got a car, I tried to drive it per the 500m quest goal, and I have got to tell you. It's like learning how to drive all over again. You go left, the game decides to go left 3 seconds later. Oh, you want to straighten out your car so you're not ramming into pedestrians on the street? Okay, just hit the arrow key once to go the other direction and we'll just ram you into on-coming traffic because what is smooth movement, am I right? I was zig-zaging down the road until the quest was finished, then immediately got out of the car and ran far away from it never to drive again.  Trying not to give up on the game just yet, I started running around to see if I could find other players who hopefully wouldn't try to gun me down at first glance, but was set in 'not ready' just in case. Mind you, I was pretty much naked because somehow from the start to the car ride, I lost my clothes and I never tried to figure out how to get them back. /secretly calls out YOLO/ After running for about 5 minutes, I finally found another player at a vehicle spawn machine thingy and tried to communicate with him using the chat. After waiting a minute for a response, he turns around, sees me, tries to shoot, realizes I can't be killed, then hops into his mini-van and drives off towards the sunset unscaved--while all I was trying to do was make a friend who knew how to play the game.  All in all, this game gets a whole whopping 0.1/5 from me. While I know there are fans who love it, which is perfectly fine, I can't find myself playing this any more, which is what I usually force myself to do when I'm really trying to find the good parts of a game, but first impressions go along way with me and this game makes Nexon's look golden.   I'd rather play GTA Online with all the f-ckery that goes on there than deal with this game. At least it's optimized better, has better graphics and playstyle, and doesn't make you feel like you're playing GTA 3's crackhead cousin of a game.  Last but not least, this game is practically p2w, with premium members getting a 30%~ bonus of cash and experience from missions and people who are willing to pay for weapons and such get all the good stuff from their cash shop. The store page should say 'Free to download, but must pay to get anywhere in the game without wanting to rip your hair out with the normal sluggish process,' not free to play.
10375	1	a	Positive: i absolutely love this game although i may not have much hours on it due to how busy i am, i still have some free time to play this game i love the graphics and i love how its not pushing you into doing things (in other words they are not forcing missions on you) i would recommend this game to anyone who loves medium paced games and games that you can basically do whatever you want. the only thing that i am not a big fan of is the price of gas for my atv, other than that this game is overall it is an okay game. Negative: although i may have a good review above i think i should put some negatives in the review. it has extreme lag even for my friend who happens to have great intenet and a beefy pc, the game needs to have seperate servers and it also needs to have a singleplayer added even if the servers cant be added due to money just add a singleplayer mode. i honestly think that the game needs to have a plot that actually goes somewhere, i may not have a ton of hours on it but i can tell by where i am at now the plot goes nowhere. i hate how people can interfere with your missions, it really sucks how i am doing a mission and soe other person can come up and kill everyone so i have to wait a while for them to respawn and have to basically restart. oh and on a recent mission i was not told how to use the weapon that they gave me so it took me 15 minutes to get someone to tell me how to use it and it was too late because i had 30 minutes to do the mission and i didnt finish it in time.  i would give this game a 5/10
3948	0	a	Horrendous player community that puts Dota and CounterStrike to shame if you're lower than 100+ ranks you're likely to get kicked from a lot of parties instantly, rampant with cheaters and pay2win real money store weapons, cars handle like boats on ice, the servers are Laggy with huge ping spikes regularly with little to no moderation, the game is poorly optimized leading to giant frame drops and a hugely outdated Unreal engine.  Uses punkbuster of all programs too as it's anti-cheat so expect to get banned for having windows volume mixer open while genuine cheaters laugh their way to free wins in every match undetected.

3435	1	a	Good ol' APB, I have over 2000+ hours on my other acc where I used to play. However now I moved on over to a second acc due to my main char being removed. Anyway--  ----- Pros: -----  + Customization is GREAT within this game, you can customize anything from your clothes to how your car looks to how your character looks.   + Can get most things in-game for free, there are some weapons on Armas that are a bit too 'OP', that'll get fixed eventually but there are ways to counter weapons that are 'OP' anyway, it's all about teamplay and tactics.  + Not that many hackers around, atleast not for long. (Might take a few days for someone to get banned) It's mostly experienced players, who've been playing the game for a long time and for that reason alone they're being accused of hacking by a majority of players.  ------ Cons:  ------  - Nowhere near as many admins/GM's in-game as there should be, there's lots of things going on in chat that shouldn't. So don't take it to heart if anyone is trying to offend you.   - Some OP Weapons in Armas, as I said they'll probably be fixed in the future ''  - Poor optimization, you'll need a pretty good rig to be able to play this game with decent framerate unless you're willing to alter some text files or download Adv.APB Launcher that'll do just that.  - Takes a few days for hackers to actually get banned, FairFight doesn't work that fast, and sometimes it can ban an innocent player. I have a few friends who've become a victim of this Perma Ban sentance.   ---  There's a bit more than that, but the game itself is FREE, so I'd give it a shot. The Tutorial isn't the best, and the community might be a bit hostile, but there are friendly players who are willing to help you out.
6370	0	a	This game had protential but it did not come through.
6527	0	a	despite what the above may say i do not recommend this. EDIT: you can put not recommended now, so that's nice
5418	0	a	You play the game you think its fun. in next 10 minutes there comes some premium â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s or just hackers who kill you 11/10 would not play again 
1088	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.

3807	0	a	Heard this game was good in the past.  As a low level, kept getting my s*** pushed in my players 300+  Not a good experience :( I'll just wait for GTAV
344	1	a	BEST GAME FTW   i like this game a lot playing it no life because i cant stop. i have to many fun in this game   only thing is steam acthviements or something like that doesn't work for me so i got only one its glitch but np   I RECOMMEND THIS GAME
2115	1	a	never lets me load the game dont know why
2052	1	a	If only
9944	1	a	For a f2p mmo such as this, the gameplay is quite enjoyable. Though the story takes a small while to warm up, after players get to know the UI to a reasonable level the game becomes slightly addictive. Cooperative class building, equipment crafting and missions make for an enjoyable experience as you and your friends explore new environments.   The only issue I had is late game when pvp gets involved. The terrirotrial resource war pvp becomes very demanding on computer performance. Though not a game breaking issue, folks without gaming towers will just have to stick with pve (which isn't really a bad thing).

10059	1	a	Nice MMORPG :) IF you like Fallout you will like this.
8	1	a	Difficulty: Difficult  The Bottom Line: Solid/Great Score: 8.0  Potentially great game ruined by the game community / chaos and hostile environment.  In a gaming world filled with sci-fi and war-themed multiplayer games, APB seems like a breath of fresh air. It takes place in modern times more or less, in a city torn apart by criminals activity. You have the choice of playing as a Criminal (gang member) or Enforcer (law enforcement) and basically have to carry out missions depending on what type of character you're playing. Often you will have to team with other players and take out 'enemies' as you carry out your mission.  When you first play around with APB: R, it's actually kind of fun. It's like a lite version of GTA mixed in with a little Saints Row. As the action unfolds, San Paro's NPC citizens react to the action as it enfolds, sometimes crouching, screaming, diving for cover, or cursing, making the city come alive.  Your experience As a newbie is pure chaos, frustration, and confusion. Go on the PvP missions and you will get blasted again and again and again relentlessly by extremely high level players or hackers/ cheaters. Slaughtered doesn't even begin to describe what happens. 'Teaming' isn't at all like co-op, where you and a bunch of people interact and help each other out. Usually, it's more like a bunch of random people thrown together with no sense of teamwork who just 'do their own thing' while carrying out a mission and ignoring you and other teammates. Ironically, while keeping silent throughout the entire mission, they'll suddenly grumble in chat about how much the team 'sucked' after the mission is lost, and then angrily leave it. Team leaders will similarly keep quiet during gameplay and not give any guidance throughout, then kick newbies off their missions when things go wrong. But as for now. gamersfirst has fixed this and you no longer get kicked unless you have a demerit medal.  Expect to be kicked/ abandoned during or after a mission a lot if you're a newbie. If you're not sensitive, you'll just become angered by the 'kicking' because by being constantly dumped, you never gain enough experience to get better at the game or meet new friends who you can play with in the future. But if you're a sensitive player, the endless round of being dumped makes the game feel hostile. The chaos is out of this world! You'll be on a mission minding your own business and suddenly a player who isn't part of your mission will just keep ramming the crap out of your vehicle over and over again or running you over. Sometimes even your own teammates will kill you by running you over with a car or shooting you for no reason.  This is exactly what the first few days for the newbie will be like-- slaughter, griefing, uncommunicative teammates, team leaders angrily kicking you off missions, teammates whining about how much their team 'sucked, being abandoned by teammates during missions. Regardless of all that. when it comes to me. having a lot of friends in the game and enjoying every moment having fun while we're playing and laughing and ignoring all the bad in game community. it's all worth it.  What else can you do in game rather than playing? Tons of thingies.  If you're a boy then you can be a 'Girl' if you're a girl then you can be a 'Boy' K-k-Kawaii-everybody wins.  You can stand 24 hours in a social district being busy or simply being afk all day.  You can be a business man or business woman and sell thingies.  You can be a designer and design thingies.  You can be creative and create thingies.  One of the best thing in this game is the Character customization. It's really great how possible you can get your in game character face to look like you in real life. which that is something people in game don't do much. usually similar/preset faces.  Overall: As for 2014. The game is still getting even more better and will get a new solid engine and will get more content and more people to play this great game. Weather you're a veteran or new, make sure to give this game a chance and jump and enjoy the chaos.
7418	0	a	Boring

2723	1	a	This game is super fun!!! I love the multiplayer and the character costumization. The guns in the game are really unique because theres such a wide variety of them so it will take a long time to use every gun. Also this game is not a pay to wing game so thats a positive. I give this game 5 stars. Such a good game!! :D 
8354	0	a	PAY WALL that is all!!!!!!
10043	1	a	Fallen Earth.  One of my favorite mmorpg's out there.  One of the better things is does is it's crafting system.  Everything you own,you can craft. Of course you can still buy it, but it is still pretty awesome.   The gameplay is somewhat okay, it feels like a normal mmorpg in the gameplay.  The world is HUGE, compared to other free2play mmorpg's i have played in a while.  There are no real class, so you can create your own playstyle from a good bunch of skills and traits.    Now i know alot of people say this is a 'Fallout Clone/copy'. Which is far from it, the game is nothing  like Fallout except that you can both have first and third person. And that it is a rpg in a apocalypse world.  So my advice is to try it out before you judge it, because hey it's free2play.
200	1	a	If you like games similar to GTA Vice City you will love this game. In my oppinion APB reloaded is like the Grand Theft Auto games (GTA3 and after) except it has what we've always wanted, Multiplayer. Customize your character and cars and unlock/upgrade your guns through a level/rank system. I think its a great game and recommend it.
2959	1	a	Its a free game to blow some time on every now and then. A little confusing at first, but slowly becomes more and more endulgin for a creative mind.
3772	0	a	I have played this game and witnessed its decline since Realtime World's Key to the City event. The game was, and still is, full of potential that is intentionally not being maximized by a lackluster, underexperienced dev team that is simply greedy.  The mechanics function purely to benefit the only few solid loadouts in the game, no matter how you play you will be forced to use certain loadouts if you wish to compete with other players of high skill. (I'd really enjoy seeing any of the majority of the community utilize something like an OSCAR vs a Joker, which does its job better 10fold, provided both players are excellent at the game.)  The community is full of vile â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Since APB's release, if you stream you can expect this to happen in this order. Stream &gt; Streamsniped &gt; DDoSed &gt; If you react, enjoy being stalked no matter where you go. The game hosts not only unscrupulous individuals, but also developers. Developers that would much rather help their friends rather than do something for the benefit of the game or talk to cheaters on steam on a regular basis. In the past, I can think of Neume claiming 'cheaters are customers' and resulting in another developer quitting. I can think of two developers that said the other employees did not foster a good working environment and had questionable design decisions. I can think of the fact that support replies to all tickets with scripted replies, you will not get a serious answer and if your ticket category is deemed questionable you can be replied to with something that is completely irrelevant to your ticket. That support team fostered older devs, such as Revoemag, or Jericho, who spoke to players directly and they became biased with how they handled those players and those players recieved special treatment.  The GMs the game has have always been questionable. There are a few videos of GMs running around using things such as invisibility during player missions, GM's banning players such as Sluttles and Argan and a few others for beating their friend in the arena mode, Fightclub who were then forced to go to support, which had no reply, and the only way to actually get them proper support was for the people receiving special treatment to bombard the developers with steam and forum PMs. This has happened many times, hell Shini recieved a 3-day ban for inquiring about an ARMAS purchase he didn't recieve so they could 'investigate his account'.  To prevent myself from going on any further, ill just sum up my issues with the game. Vile community Unsupportive producers and development team Questionable design decisions and lack of any truly produced content (95% of all the content they have released was content that was stripped from RTW's version of the game.) Poorly optimized Greedy producers and development team  Hell, this could go on for hours with examples and just listing SUMMARIES of my issues. I legitimately regret every hour I spent on this game and any smart player would quit and attempt to get their money back.  
3819	0	a	APB is an interesting game with tons of potential and would be a wonderful game if it wasn't being developed by one of the worst companies in the industry.
3784	0	a	I'm just gonna--BOOM! Died by rocket launcher!  Gonna hop in my car--BOOM! Died by rocket launcher!  I'm gonna give this game a positive revie--BOOM! Died by rocket launcher.  This game used to be good until all the 'BOOM! Died by rocket launcher' stuff.  1/10, too many rocket launcher booms.
2910	1	a	Pretty Decent Game.
3882	0	a	Like games where the 'good' players are a selected few who are willing to spend IRL money in the game for op gear that cancels out the skill factor of games? well no further because within 4 hours of me playing and enjoying it i have encountered two players with weapons that can kill me within a matter of seconds from any distance. a game with alot of good potential with developers who clearly dont care isnt a good combo and this is a incredible example they remove the fun out of a game that is basically GTA online PLEASE DONT PLAY THIS GAME for your sake it is trash and will ruin the joy you were having from it when you encounter the cancer of the games community
7542	0	a	HARD TO DOWNLOAD INSTALL THIS INSTALL THAT
2680	1	a	Great fun, some problems but they only small.
1239	1	a	The biggest most funnest online open world multiplayer out there!
9082	1	a	They Basicly made this game for welfare bums that can't afford any FALLOUT GAMES.Fallout earth is a game about lag switching.And stealing from as many hardworking clans as you can...Gotta survive out in the wasteland.And pretend you're A girl so people give you free items and they can't kill you.
3401	1	a	  i like the game but honestly the community sucks as i free player its not possible to get past silver since all gold players are premium and have paid perks and weapons. but as a silver player or below you can have a good time with the game
784	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
8058	0	a	Full of hackers P2W Banned for no reason
7482	0	a	love the game but all the hacks in this game, it's just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. and it sucks how there are no npcs to even fight either. it's strict always pvp fighting but I'd love there to be PvE fighting in the game also.
66	1	a	APB reloaded is a great game in my opinion. The costumization in this game is just insane. Over a million combinations possible with your character and vehicle design. Upgrades onto your weapons, character and car. Such as 'Increased car explosion radius' Or 'Mobile ammo box' Or for your charcter 'Kelvar implants' .... It's insane.  The gameplay is extremely fun to play, but also extremely easy to make you rage. My advise would be to play for short whiles. About 1 hour, take 15 minutes break and another hour. Other then all that, it's no P2W (You can buy weapons, but everything is normally achievable without having to pay), and you can really â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with people, it's funny as hell!. My rating on this game is 8.5/10
8162	0	a	Got banned for nothing. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
5642	0	a	No, just no. I was looking for cops and robbers &amp; what I got was a clunky shoot-em-up where the cops act and look like criminals, the game is okay, just make sure its your style.
6291	0	a	foucking game 
7368	0	a	Honestly, APB: Reloaded itself is great and fun. The game type is entirely unique, in that it's basically criminal gangsters versus lawful gangsters (Criminals vs Enforcers), destroying the city through random missions and the robbery of citizens' belongings by means of ram-raiding shop windows or mugging them on the street. The open world instances are flashy and fun to look at and explore, even if the majority of buildings can't be entered. The game's customization is, and maybe always will be, the best of its class -- if there even is another in that glorious top-tier -- simply because you can make your own theme songs, decals, and more through the in-game editors. Even if you aren't very good at art, you can still enjoy the simplicity of the game's customization, and make complex designs very easily.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because of the company that presently owns it: GamersFirst. Whatever good content they can add is made worthless by one of two means: The slow ranking system, or the simple fact that it's exclusive to the cash shop, making it one of the largest pay-to-wins I've ever played. There's also the major problem of cheaters/hackers, and the terrible security that's presently implemented. Still, I found a way to look past all of that and enjoy the game for about a year, even if the servers rubber-banded every now and then. Unfortunately, that rubber-banding has gotten worse over time, as the servers are simply getting more and more degraded by the second. GamersFirst is incapable of understanding that they need to upgrade these servers, and now the game is in a state where every movement has a 5-second delay, rubber-banding runs rampant, and disconnections occur every 5-10 minutes which won't allow you back on for another 20. GamersFirst does not understand the real ideas behind running a good game besides content, and in that they have ruined the experience of the game completely.  This is not the first good concept they've destroyed. WarRock is another shooter that now belongs to Nexon Europe, and once belonged to GamersFirst. The vehicles in the game are solid, and plays like a free-to-play Battlefield, in its own way. When my friends first told me about WarRock, the first thing they warned me to avoid was the public servers. I asked why and they gave me one answer: hackers. By the time I got that warning, though, I had already joined a public server and saw a flying tank getting destroyed by a glitched helicopter. I quickly left, and played in a private room with my friends, having a great time until the servers suddenly went down. They didn't come back up within half an hour, and we all decided to uninstall the game shortly after.   It saddens me that APB has been ruined by such a terrible company, to the point where I can no longer recommend it. I've heard rumors that Perfect World Entertainment is looking into buying APB: Reloaded from GamersFirst, and I must say that sounds like a far better idea than letting it run on the slowly melting servers it's running on now.
1691	1	a	Customizing is da â¥â¥â¥â¥
6453	0	a	This game looks like the best game ever created, but it's a swift, hard kick in the balls once you start playing. It's pay2win, the missions are impossible, the shooting sucks â¥â¥â¥, and it seemed to me like I was the only cop and everyone else was playing as the criminals.
10301	1	a	really good

5572	0	a	can u fix apb the lancher dosent work
4771	0	a	Do you see those 25+ hours I have on record for this game? Not a single second of that was in-game play-time. You see, it actually took me more than 25 hours of trying to get the game to actually start to realize that no matter how good the game was, it wasn't worth it. So, ignoring whether my computer is just screwed up (which I doubt, I've never encountered this problem in other games) or something, I can't quite say that I recommend this game to others.
2156	1	a	This was my favorite game ever, and always will be, even though it absolutely sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ now. 11/10 IGN
676	1	a	I recomend this Game because it is just an amazing graphical game with lots of missions and many more things it's like GTA 5 but no flying or boating so it's like a free gta you might as well get it because it is a free game that plays amazingly. The driving controlls are w,a,s,d, but you can make do with them and change the settings if you want so I rate the game. 9.5/10 for being free and this good you should get it and play it and be happy.
10014	1	a	yes this game is old yes this game is buggy and does not have the best combat but this is not a simple game , its actually very challenging and rewarding game crafting is owesome and unlike any other game i have found.  There are no classes you make your own and have fun with it, leveling is slow but fun because you get to enjoy a lot of content tthe game map is massive and filled with dungeons and cool places to explore i played mmos for more than 10 years and never had anything come close to a game that is as unique as this one ,   Try this game have some patience learn how to play it and dont listen to those guys who just loged in and didnt understand anything , you cant learn to play a game in 10 minutes   also ifyou have at least a 1MB download speed the games takes 2 hour max to download ,the guys who took days must have a bad bandwidth
6611	0	a	Nope. This game has absolute potential, but new players are vulnerable to hackers and higher ranks with overpowered weapons. Don't waste your time installing this game, unless you want to get blown up by a pornstar with an RPG and rage over it. The only good thing about APB: Reloaded is the character customization. Not friendly to newcomers, you have to pay2win. Uninstalled immediately.
3776	0	a	After putting in a little over 70 hours into this game, I believe I can finally review it.  Pros: -Customization is fantastic in this game, regardless if its clothes or guns, you can change very small details to make your character  feel  your own. -As what on the outside looks like a generic Cops n' Robbers game, it actually is much deeper than just run and gun missions. There's a story behind each contact, and the relationships between the contacts begin to form as you rise through the ranks. -The weapons and clothing (no armor, per say) really do set you in the mood of a city that breeds anarchy and violence. It's depicted so well on the criminal's gear, wild and more punk looking. The Enforcers however, look very rough and beaten, but very strong.  Cons: -Connectivity issues are a huge problem when it comes to their servers. Regardless of what computer you're on, you still seem to lag out and drive right into a wall, or run right into a room full of baddies. Eventually coming back to full connection dead and respawning. -Hackers. Oh my. Hackers. There are times when they get confused with people who pay to win, but I'll get to that. There are massive ban waves that the moderators do to wipe all hackers that they detect. However, it's an IP ban, which means simply changing your IP address will let you back in. I believe it's the three strike rule, and then your character is deleted from that game. Regardless, for every one good player there are two hackers, and they usually farm kills on low-level servers. -The leveling system (Reputation/Threat). This system is flawed, I believe, as when you start out you get a letter 'T' next to your name. This stands for Trainee, and that's where it ends. There is no closed tutorial, as you are learning from a menu that tells you what to do in the active game. No training wheels, kiddies, because you could go into matchmaking as a trainee and get paired against a gold or two, and be completely destroyed. This wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, if the system wouldn't go by threat level. It doesn't detect threat level until after 5-10 matches of pure hell and dying, which is what usually drives people away. -Pay to Win. Finally, we're here. Considering this game is F2P, I was overjoyed when I first entered. I looked past my many starting matches and hoped that I would eventually find something that I could latch onto and love...I was wrong. The guns and outfits for normal players are nice, and take a while to get (A while is doing repetitive missions for the same contact until you unlock that tier), buying from the ARMAS Marketplace is 10x better. I played for 40 hours normal, and I was struggling at best on a Bronze server. Bronze. Only a step up from Green when are literally entering servers. I have a fully decked out character after spending $40 in the marketplace because everything is so overpriced. Overpriced weapons for overpowered players.  I really wish I could reccomend, but finally, I cannot because of the frustrating issues that this game not only displays as 'learning the ropes and playing with a great community' but disagrees and actually begins to kick new players from parties who say anything bad about the community or the game.
6661	0	a	when i click start nothing happens, help?
6640	0	a	pay2win game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
4622	0	a	It's probably one of the worst games I've ever had the misguided pleasure to play.Terrible community, bad game mechanics, that sort of stuff. But it's strangely addicting the first time around, so you keep playing and playing, even though you know its absolute garbage. I can't explain it really. It's like bad drugs or cigarettes, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ for you but you keep coming back.   Overall: Best game I ever had the pleasure of uninstalling.
3556	1	a	play the best game apb and i might let you playy with me XD 
4897	0	a	Cons: -GTA but P2W and horrible imbalances, with the non-P2W being horribly punished untill you go full out P2W.  -Toxic community, worse than Dota's. Somehow are proud that the game's P2W, probably because they're inferior to everyone in every way so they need to dish out for the best weapons possible to feel good for once.  -Game runs poorly, graphics are completely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yet it somehow runs worse than GTAV  Pros:  +Good if you want something to cross the line and help you finally suicide.

4730	0	a	Apparently it's pay to win, although I couldn't really tell. Everyone had lots of gear, somebody shot me and I had no idea what was going on.
9180	0	a	I played this game with my buddy Left Shark. He said he didn't really like it because Katy Perry wasn't in it. Honestly, I thought everything was trying to be put together into an RPG game, whilst you see that all there is to it is hilarious death sounds and funny PvP battles with enemies that die after yelling 'DIE!' I really think this game has potential, but I probably won't play it for a while.
8906	1	a	Download the game Call it â¥â¥â¥â¥ Uninstall the game  Come back to the game it's pretty cool it gets boring uninstall the game  Come back to the game It's awesome it gets boring uninstall the game  But somehow, the game is still fun.

9952	1	a	Kind of buggy. Price is right (free to play) took a little time to install. Played worse free games. Game should be happy i recommend it. just because i feel like it... lol
1552	1	a	Used to be really good. Now it's mostly about who can pay the most to win. Yet you can still enjoy it sometimes.
6222	0	a	This game is way too confusing. The hud is useless and overpacked. The maps are really small when compared to gta and such like. The posse system is really stupid and the fact that you cannot spot crimes in progress sucks. (There is a button to press like f4 or something, but that is glitched to â¥â¥â¥â¥). What else... Oh yeah, the community can be unfriendly. Thats the kicker. So I cannot say this game is fun, or I would be lying. Play something else, don't spend money on this game.
8434	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.

4475	0	a	P2W. That's all.
7532	0	a	UPDATE, yeah well it's good game in a way if there not was so much PAY TO WIN over it + ever high is most time always a camping noob or a run away or just dont know how to attack or always wait on you to attack so more or less, most golds dont have any balls at all or just only sniper wtih a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing noob nano or some other armas noob weapons and yeah i have been really good to play this game a time but now i only play wtih friends more or less for after 2 years this game is all about PAY to WIN now and no longer about skills X( it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sad and yes as you can see i have played close to 2000hours and it's more for i played befor it was on Steam so i say give one try and if it sucks than just â¥â¥â¥â¥ it side ways ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if you like GTA 4 you need to play this for it like GTA 4 in MMO just of cause you can lvl up and unlock things but you can close to customization all the way you want! :D for me it's one of the best game ever!
4611	0	a	So, where to begin with this game.  The gameplay is good, that's all i'll say about that. What's wrong with this game?  - The Community  - Pay2Win  - The constant fps drop every minute or two  This has to be the worst online community i've ever seen. If you want to play with a bunch of spoiled kids who insult you because you didn't have your 'mommy' buy you in game skins and overpriced/powered weapons and don't play good when you've just started and go into a level matched mode, have fun.  Everything else, yeah, you already know. No need for me to explain.
9926	1	a	Simply one of the best MMO's. It's complicated enough to get rid of all the kids. And not too complicated to keep it at a Mature level. This game is for grown ups who want to use some brain while doing things instead of just hitting 2 buttons and changing looks.
4795	0	a	pease of sh*t
1599	1	a	A godd gta-i game its a fun TPS the costumazation is endless going from masks to tattos but a lot of cool features need premium acc whitch requires real invested money,there is no single player but the multiplayer ist that much laggy and the grapich are deccent for a free game.The controls are tricky but the options menu takes care of that.I would reccomend this game to any gta fan ,
7472	0	a	When I saw the trailers, I thought that this is going to be epic game. But the truth is, that it is not. It has some good features, like breaking into a store throught the shop window with a car or the possibility of editing your character's appearance. But to be honest, you can't stand a chance in most of the PVP actions, since there are always players with special items from the store, that you can buy for real money.   So for me, it's a NO, when someone asks me about the game.
3042	1	a	Nice game!
630	1	a	Awesome game!!! reminds GTA and it's online
6724	0	a	This game is deader than the zombie apocalypse, the nuclear fallout, or whatever disaster that decreases human population density up to 50 square miles per person per server region.   If you played the game right now, you will get to be a part of a special few that have spent too much money to let the game go. Also some people just can't play the game without 'trainers'.  You want to play with the same person every night? That have been playing years before you? Has tricks that you don't have? I guess this game is for you.   As a person that has been a commune to the game before, my warning of this game being a 'Gold' drainer has not been heeded 5 years ago. Buy permanent to win or pay premium to be financially stable to even participate in the whole item customization and selling experience.  Yes you will have to rent guns that expire weekly if you have not bought any. Expire weekly.  If not bought. Up to 20k gold for a gun. When a maximum amount possible weekly earned is a little 5k. Not counting the the little Cops and Robbers sideshow that earns more money than the actual missions, nobody does that anymore.   The new guns that came out on the market is to say 'Sorry but we are too lazy to fix the weapon balance, here buy these new ones instead'. Those guns are not 'rentable'. 
2626	1	a	Having logged nearly one-thousand hours into APB:Reloaded, during the many updates, I can confidently say: This game has me forever. APB:Reloaded caters quite well (Thanks to the more recent updates) to new players, but still has a fair learning curve, and rewards the more hardcore gamers like myself.  APB:Reloaded hosts two Factions: Enforcers and Criminals. Whichever faction you choose, you're signing yourself up for the most brutal Cops vs Robbers shooter you've ever played.  Just like with any shooter, no matter how meshed it is with Online play, the tedious dying and respawning will sink its teeth into any gamer and steer them to the point of aggravation. Team up with friends or acquaintances, however, and you'll be the one enjoying the sweet taste of Raging Gamers.  APB:Reloaded incorporates teamwork as well as common sense and intense strategy. Playing against opposition, you need to spend your time wisely; rushing straight for an objective is the best way to feed the opposition kills and points. That being said, retreating to cover behind a vehicle after snagging a briefcase, you had better pray said vehicle doesn't explode if it takes too much damage.  All this reviewing, and I haven't gone over the character, vehicle and weapon customization yet. Needless to say, the vast majority of options given to you, the player, is quite overwhelming and will keep you playing for hours.  All aspects considered, I'm giving APB:Reloaded 8/10. There is room for some improvement, but that will not stop me from playing.
8241	0	a	Great now with the new anti-cheat system. Still abit to laggy tho but cannot complain WAY better than a year ago.
392	1	a	You shoot people, you get money. You get money, you kill people! What else do you want?
4461	0	a	This game worked once for me. ONCE. it was super laggy, i didnt know how to play the game and i got spawnkilled by a guy with a rocket launcher.    So whatever you do, dont waste your time on this stupid game. it could have been a good game but its just â¥â¥â¥â¥. evreything is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4084	0	a	i am still having log in issues with this trash game 
4103	0	a	I'm not sure whether Steam has marked down the amount of time I've invested in this game, but I'd give it a rough estimate of about 300 hours, between 2012/13, and a quick reinstall in 2015 with a prompt uninstall afterwards.  First impression? MMO Grand Theft Auto with way more customization? Cool!  Or at least you think, until you actually start to do missions, or anything relevant to what your objectives are. Griefers are rampant, and Pay 2 Win mentality is ingrained in what could have been a great game from GamersFirst. You'll be killed by hackers, heckled in text chat for being new (or if you mess up at all over anything), have your eardrums blasted out by post-kill death sounds, and people who you cannot defeat simply because they've dumped (too much) real money into a garbage MMO.  Do yourself a favor, just buy Grand Theft Auto V and be dissatisfied with that. It won't be nearly as frustrating.
3453	1	a	This is one of the most broken, poorly coded, bloated, neglected, newbie-unfriendly MMOs I have ever played, yet I can't seem to pull myself away. It's a mess that somehow still manages to provide hours and hours of ridiculous fun. I consistently neglect the mounting hoard of games in my library to play this game. I therefore do recommend it, although I would caution anyone that wants to get started that the game has a rather steep learning curve. The matchmaking is very hit and miss, which means you will likely get curbstomped for a long time before your feet find the bottom of the pool.  The plusses for this game are its impressive array of customizable options, and the intensity of its firefights, which can, at its best, feel relentless and fast-paced. The negatives are its bloated memory requirements, server lag, the toxicity of the player-base, the repetitiveness of missions. and the lack of administrative support.  In the end, however, if MMO GTA is what you're looking for... well, this isn't exactly up to that, but it's the closest you'll get, and for me, that was worth the time.
6009	0	a	It makes me have to redownload steam and all my games, Also it gave my pc a virus.
9591	0	a	Step 1.) Create account Step 2.) Log in Step 3.) Ok so it's 'getting an update'? Step 4.) Now I'm re-accepting the agreements... Step 5.) Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of time (or until you stop playing)
6834	0	a	it wont let me luanch apb i press start then it wont load
5833	0	a	Horrible
8938	1	a	It's really dead for what it could be, with lots of bugs, but it's still entertaining. gigantic open world to explore and tons of quests to do. Crafting is not that bad after you get the grip of it. played with a friend around 100h outside steam, had good fun. Plus, it's free.
6253	0	a	GTA Clone, ruined by cheats and limited missions
8117	0	a	As someone who has played APB a long time back when it wasnt on steam aswell, I have to say this, The game is good yes but what ruined this game atleast for me and proably for many others.. Is the fact that the community is the way it is... They are salty.. Mad at that theres cheater and that it's basicly P2W Most of the players you will meet are only in there to show others how horrible this game has become by being rude and sorry my language being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s aswell   Now if you can somehow avoid the community I can tell you will have your fun in this with friends and such   I am honestly suprised it is still alive seeing how GTA online is now on pc and has much more stuff to do :p well on that note   My regards.
3197	1	a	pay to win but is a really cool game
8647	0	a	This is a lot like Grand Theft Auto, if you took GTA and removed a ton of the content, made it nearly impossible to make money, and made it more of a pay to win. If you want to somewhat enjoy this game, you're going to have to shell out more money than it would cost you to just buy GTAV, every single month. So, in other words, just go buy GTAV instead.
1609	1	a	APB, a game where gravity is made up, and a garbage truck can do a triple backflip
6511	0	a	That lady's pants are about to fall off.
2578	1	a	Awesome Game Great Free To Play
6631	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The customization is amazing, more games need to have this type of personalization. And that's the only good thing about it. The game itself barely works, controls are awful, the community is horrible (you get called a n00b by others when you ask politely for help and their best advice is to 'git gud â¥â¥â¥ lel'), glitches everywhere. I'm going to quote another reviewer because everyone else has pretty much summed it up: 'Complete garbage and full of hackers of all kinds.'
5360	0	a	Why cant i play it?
2339	1	a	its like an mmo gta. the missions are challenging. and it is 110% necessary to use teamwork. ive only been playing for a little while but i love it.  my only problem is the premuim option. i feel that some of the stuff that is not available to f2p player gives little rich kids an unfair advantage.  but the game is truly amazing :)
2567	1	a	10/10-APB Reloaded it is a very fun and unique game you pick a side the cops or the criminals both with different gameplay the criminals can rob store windows and load the stolen items into a truck and the police can chase them or the criminals can go and sell them for dirty money. I do reccomend you play this as it is is free but the only down side is that there are many hackers and it is kind of p2w at some points with super fast tommy guns or super fast cars that are bought with a ton of real cash.

6025	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. i know this review was harsh but never for the love of god play it 
2859	1	a	Love the game and the customizations but some hackers r spoiling it
1903	1	a	Me: 'What's that sound?'  Brian: 'I didn't tell You? This is the Talavan.'  Brian: 'Talavan? Wait, why did you get ou-' BOOM (Assorted laughter) Me: 'F*** You, Brian.'
2580	1	a	Damm good game 51 hours of play 2 characters. This game is pure epicness definatly get it
10151	1	a	played this game for years now the devs never give new content or fix old bugs pure lazy dev team but for a frre to play game its one of best out there just dont hit max level to fast or bordom will follow
8337	0	a	This game at the first release was a GTA online free to play fix for those who didnt have a console to play GTA on. My friend introduced this to me a long time ago and it initally seemed like a fun game. Tons of customization, open world city, decent ranking system, and some pretty memorable fights. Though as the game has changed, so has my feelings for it. ABP has become a buy-to-win unfriendly tumor of a game to which I cant remotely enjoy anymore. The worse thing about this game is basically who ever buys the $40 assault rifle through micro transactions along with the $35 rocket launcher is now deemed invincible. APB has become a sandbox that requires you to buy quality weapons with real time money or else you will be the punching bag of the game. My friend bought me a $20 assualt rifle and let me tell you that made everything a lot easier... but that didnt help long since more people would buy the $40 ones. I dont consider a game fun when it requires equipment quality over skill, it shouldnt be who ever has the most expensive gun wins every match, rather it should be who ever has the keenest shot or the quickest reflexes and a quality weapon helps to a degree. sorry for this poorly written review but i do not recommend playing APB, its simply a cluster of microtransaction idiots with completely decked out assault rifles and RPG's
1358	1	a	a fun game but they do have some balanceing issue(really bad issues) but i had a blast overall so i recommend this
8770	0	a	Spent 40 dollars on this game. Finally hit rank 197 so I can use everything. I was banned 3 days later. For no stated reason. Wrote them a ticket and still no response. Stay away from this game and this company.
10258	0	a	Probably the worst Post Apocalyptic Survival i have played. So much lag, graphics are completely terrible, i noticed a lot of hacking as well along with overpowered enemies and you have to put tons of money into the game to be able to get anything good. As of all the game is not worth it, it is a waste of time and space.  2/10 i would say to be honest, The game has achieved to be on steam and has gotten many players to play it. But everything is off on it completely. And also to add the website is off 80% of the time and so is the main server. (I have played for a whole day\24 hours and it still sucks â¥â¥â¥...)
4126	0	a	Community. Enough said.
414	1	a	Apb Reloaded is one of the Best Games,itÂ´s F2p but it has a BIg Fun Factor if you play it with some Friends or you are in a clan. You can Design the Craziest things if you are a good designer,nothing is Impossible in this Game. Apb Reloaded shows us, you must not pay for a Good Game !
3736	1	a	Overall 7/10  Pros: +Customization is very well put into focus +Level of detail is amazing of the level/word +Music is good (few annoying songs plus you can maek your own mixtape) +Lots to do +Decent economy (no WoW farming money) +In-game market +Localization (havent met a person from another country/timezone) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Cons: -Pay 2 Win (some guns are way to OP and takes a 200 hour account to earn them on a F2P) -Premium is a option to buy for boosted stats and more cusomization -Broken world loading (empty servers of crims doing ram raids) -No Bulletdrop/Sniper rifles being way out of range but having the ability to 2 shot people (weapon in balence) -Cheaters (F2P game obviusly there will be some) -No large scale missions (server wide missions) -G1 has decided to run this more of a side business (Updates are usually seasonaly and only add more store features) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Want to play a true version of this look up 'APB EMU .com'  (http://apbemu.com/)  when this releases I will most definetely be spending time on this.  Reccomendation: Look at 'Identity rpg' that is a mix between Arma 3 and GTA V  (http://www.identityrpg.com/)  this looks and feels like a nice mmorpg when it will get relaesed if you can wait for another year or so.
8574	0	a	Maybe itll get better when it gets on console but now,bad
6965	0	a	why play a game that doesnt work?
307	1	a	Beautiful game, it starts slow as getting used to it is quite dificult, much more with all the other experienced players. Essetialy, it's a GTA like game, online-only, with much more to do in terms of missions sadly not in terms of interactivity. Still I recommend you all play this, puT some time into it and you'll start winning, guides also help, you should also take in mind lag is part of the game, driving is also horrible and some weapons are completely useless whilst others amazing so make sure to spend your money wisely, my top picks for starter weapons, if you really wanna get kills, would be the colby-smg (for close to mid quarters) and the H-NVR 7 (a 2 hit kill sniper), if you know how to tap fire but an N-tec, they're really good once you know how to use it! Remember the tutorials always help!
2897	1	a	Customization in this game is pretty varied and cool. Missions start to get repetitive, but the rewards make up for it.
3236	1	a	it ruined my life
229	1	a	awsome 
6839	0	a	Buy GTAV Instead
116	1	a	all the noobs who don't recommend it are just silver lowranks. Get gud or get rekt. Btw you first have to put like 200/300 moneys in this before you look cool, have awesome weapons and have a cool car.
6101	0	a	HORRIBLE game, sorry. microtransactions, grinding, the works
7009	0	a	I would recommend this game, but I can't connect to a server, tried all of them but wouldn't, gave it like a week just to try it out, but it still doesn't work
3605	1	a	This game is great! I love companies who make us wait 7 months for their promised engine updates! If you like waiting, this is DEFINITELY the game for you! GamersFirst promised an engine update by the end of Summer 2015, and now it's February 2016! I love it! I really hope they don't make us NOT wait! It's the best part of the game! GamersFirst really knows how to treat 'gamers first'! TL; DR BEST WAITING GAME OF ALL TIME!
4840	0	a	Well there are some goods and a lot of bads. I'll start with the goods and end with an in-depth overview.  Goods: -EXTREMELY vast customization options (though limited by lack of Premuim) -Fantastic Social/'chill out' District -Very easy to use and grasp -Decent backstory -Simplistic -Potentially great teamwork  Bads: -Hello hacker city -Pay to win -Customization limited by Premium/P2W -Godawful driving (the action-reaction delay is horrific) -Very awkward controls -It's on PC instead of console -Too many kids to count -VERY CPU instensive  Overview: Basically, APB is a simplistic, visually stunning, F2P MMO very much alike Saints Row. The variety of weapons and vehicles is nice, the customization is second to none and actually tops Saints Row and any other MMO and the gameplay is addictive, racey and smooth. Though the game does have a tendency for lag spikes.  Sadly, I feel the bads outweigh the goods. The ratio of hackers/cheaters to legit players is 50/50 or MORE on the hacker side unless you play with newbies. The P2W and Premium feautures of the game are disgraceful. You will be MILES above the rest if you purchase with real money - and a LOT of it. This also sadly limits the lovely customization. The benefits and potentially essentials you get from Premuim are completely unfair and a rip-off for what they charge.  The community for the game is frankly disgusting, too. Primarily due to it's fanbase being kids, low-esteemed 'girlgamers' and social-networking rejects. Expect to be called a noob and whined at in a moments notice and don't be suprised if the chat seems like it's been taken over by an army of 14yr old scene kids and CoDfans. The marketplace is lacking within this too. I would say that 'Gold Threat' players are far worse than any whiney tryhard in a CoD hacker lobby. Avoid them at all costs.  Verdict: Unless you're wealthy and willing to spend a good $120 on this 'F2P' game, willing to play with the newbies (which isn't bad at all), speak Russian, want a social MMO or have a bunch of clan-mates to play with, I would not waste time and memory with this game. It is extremely CPU intensive and addictive. Otherwise, gold-threats avoided, this is rather fun.
3318	1	a	This Game is MAJOR Pay-2-Win, the Anti-Cheat System Sucks and there is some Input Lag as well.  But if you can get past all that then the Game is somewhat Fun and Enjoyable with Friends. Just my Personal Opinion Though.   Final Rating 5.8/10
9429	0	a	Its pretty awful
9712	0	a	Too much work for such little reward.
3747	0	a	The most toxic community I have ever met.
9935	1	a	An A-OK Post-Apoc MMORPG and believe me most Post-Apocs MMORPGs suck!
6116	0	a	the game is completly one sideded all you have to do to win is 1.be a cop 2.buy guns and thing with real cash 3.camp criminal spawn points 4.wait for criminals to start a mission and seal club the new criminal players
9901	1	a	I don't recomend this game. I haven't even played it...and that's the problem. It takes forever just to check for updates. When you actually get in the game, there's no cursor or anything. It's hard to push any buttons it displays. I can't even click the freakin PLAY button. If this happens to you, don't even bother. If it doesn't, play away.
6793	0	a	This game gave me cancer. It is simply awful. I do NOT recommend it.
1422	1	a	Be a cop so you can racially profile and randomly beat them without any reprucussions!   10/10 would beat again
5878	0	a	the type of game where they charge stupid prices for the good stuff
3562	1	a	Cool game
777	1	a	I liked that the game can be played with friends on a private surver, one thing i disliked is the fact that youre character can become gasy and food that says redusces gassiness dose not.
4575	0	a	You want to be shot down by hackers? then this is the game for you ENJOY!!
4656	0	a	What used to be a great game with lots of potential was bought up by a new company whose devs were there for the money, not the game. Now it's a mere shadow of its former self, filled to the brim with hackers and toxic kids, as the devs recycle old assets to churn out the last couple dollars they can get. I'd stay away from this digital landfill of a game.

3177	1	a	its cool but not that cool 
759	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a game that combines 3rd person over-the-shoulder shooting within a sprawling MMO world that is always changing. After a rough start with RTW (being a retail game with monthly subscription) it was closed and sooner or later picked up by K2 Networks. Formerly known as GamersFirst; K2 Networks set out to turn APB into the 'Free2Play' game it is today, complete with a Cash Shop *ridiculous prices.* Overall a decent game. The customization will keep you busy for hours. The balancing could use a little work and the server is straight up horrible at times. 'Hackusations' are common in every other match. Although actual hackers play, it's not as common as the game-chat would have you believe. Some people will tell you it's pay2win. I disagree. Get a friend, and use a mic! APB:R gets repetitive from the few game modes they give you (just in a different location). Defend this. Attack that. Shoot this. Repeat. I'd recommend this game to a group of friends looking to spend time on a fast paced game and don't mind getting their a** beat from balancing issues.
3029	1	a	I love games where first of all you get to choose either female or male, but customization is key for me. Being able to control something like that is top notch already. But i love the feel of the game too. Flows nicely and i enjoy every step of the way.
8037	0	a	I don't recomend this to any new players because everyone else would be OP to you.
8641	0	a	APB Reloaded for dummys 1 download the game 2 sign in 3 fail signing in 4 make an account 5 sign in again 6 fail signing in sign in 7 fail signing in 8 realise you needed to confirm your email 9 confirm your stupid email 10 sign in for the last friggin time! 11 finally it works... 12 create your character anticipating that it has the best creation system ever 13 start the game with a crappy character 14 game lags like friggin crazy!! 15 realize, it wasn't love at first sight 2/10
1758	1	a	APB capitalizes on customization, great built-in design tools with lots of stuff to unlock and lots of skimpy non-clothing available for your female avatar's unproportionate â¥â¥â¥. Even though unsubscribed players are limited in how many design elements they can have on each peice of clothing or each vehicle, it still feels functional and fun. Hanging around the social district and seeing the hilariously creative outfits that players design is the most entertaining part of APB. Giving myself a back tattoo that said 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ASS' for all to see provided me with deep satisfaction.  Although the matchmaking and missions are fluid, innovative and fun, the sub-par combat and driving mechanics don't provide a sturdy foundation for all of this glorious and limitless customization to stand on, and it is reflected by its ever-crumbling playerbase.   Play long enough and your 'threat' level increases, putting you at a different matchmaking level to keep games fair and balanced, while at the same time isolating you from an exponentially larger part of the player pool with each rise in threat level. Before long I had reached the highest threat level, and was rewarded with a whopping 2 possible opponents that were currently online to play against. Nice. The most proposed solutions to lowering your threat level to again have fun with the game are to 'lose on purpose' or 'create a new character'... What? Seriously?  I'd like to see customization like this in the next stab at an online GTA-style open world game. APB definitely layed the groundwork for a matchmaking method that keeps everyone in the same world while simultaneously pitting groups of players against eachother. You'll often see fights between other teams going on right next to you.   Cool game overall, although the most fun to be had is in the customization menus and not in playing the game itself.  
5036	0	a	This game is HUGE P2W(Pay to win) Note: I used to have the game before It came on steam  Now here is some good stuff and bad staff about the game  Bad Stuff: 1. The game really wants you to throw their money your money at them, while at the same time they try to seem generous 2. Just about all the good guns need to be bought,Including cars and clothes with Real money 3. Everyone who DOES pay for guns, are Way too Over Powered or just do really insane damage 4. You need to spend a ridiculous amount of hours to get enough cash for weapons that are DECENT,by that I mean guns that dont need 3 clips to kill someone  Good Stuff: 1. The games custimaztion is Pretty fun and you can make just about anything, Unless you â¥â¥â¥â¥ out money 2. The game has a nice healthy player base and there is rarley any hackers, but sometime the players who pay look like hackers..... 3. It isnt to graphicly demanding, so you dont need a high end graphics card to run this game at high settings  Overall, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing paid to win or spend a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on of hours getting money to get good guns

4063	0	a	well its too much of a pay to win game and i hate that
8320	0	a	Blablabla Juggernaut here.. new growl vehicle there, every 2 weeks a 'new' so called weapon.. all about making money.. bad servers.. and the only slogan will may describe this game is: pay to win.

6567	0	a	i have 25 gb of space on my computer left after the download and it say i cant play because i need 2 gb or something like that
2933	1	a	If your interested in playing a MMO which has a INSANE amount of costumization options, then give this game a shot.  If your not interested in costumeization, then walk away. Very Very slowly
2988	1	a	I love this game,except that the noobs don't really get a chance.It needs to be less of a p2w
7651	0	a	Doesn't accept passwords, takes forever to load on SATA III SSD.

3802	0	a	What Reloaded studios PROMISED everyone on the APB:Reloaded RETAIL BOX:  - Asylum District - Racing District - Clan Wars (aka turf wars)  This was to be delivered by the end of 2012. None of it happened.  We're now by the end of 2013 in all this time and what they actually delivered was:  - Fightclub (A deathmatch mode which is basically a rehash of already existing city parts but with boundaries so that you don't actually load the entire city which causes horrible performance issues) - Lucky box 1 LIMITED TIME ONLY!!! EXCLUSIVE!! BUY NOW!!! SALE!!!! (gambling real money for p2win items) - Lucky box 2 - Lucky box 3 - Lucky box 4 - Lucky box 5 - Lucky box 6 - Lucky box 7 - Lucky box 8 - Re-hued machinegun (grey to gold) skins for 15â¬  Also, they will try to sell you the idea that this game is not P2WIN, I'd say that's arguable... Boosters vs Grindfest, Nano vs... everything else.   Update: Make that... - Lucky Box 9, 10 and 11 now.
2470	1	a	i would really recommend this game for players of the crackdown and crackdown 2 xbox 360 games because there really alike 
2791	1	a	APB is a very good game. Belongs to the sand table style game can be where you let all can go. There are many ways to do the task, very interesting
1341	1	a	brilliant customization and realistic crimes. i recommend this game to those people who like cops and robbers games    /\  _____ / / ___________  / __ \ / / /_ \ _ \  &gt; &lt; / / | / /_ \ \  / __ \ / / | \ \_/ \  \____ / / / |___| \_____ /  \ / \/ \/   \/ 
8903	0	a	Combat seems very basic, npcs stand still till you get close enough and the menu system isnt as user friendly as other games. I dont see how this was ever a pay to play game.  Has good theory but isnt pulled off, the world has no life to it.
3049	1	a	I LOVE IT, is like A..... GTA game unless is just MP and is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ loads with friends :D
3972	0	a	The concept of this game is really cool. Its kinda like a GTA online shooter, its completly open world and the customization possibilities are HUGE! You can literally create everything for your character!   A big downside of this game is the ingame shop. Im playing at gold rank without any premium stuff and weapons and 90% of my opponents are just people with premium to get more money and Golden Weapons with max Upgrades from the store. Not having these can make the game very frustrating since your opponents will just be stronger in any way without much skill. They reg Health faster, their weapons deal more dmg, their accuracy is higher. For example there is a premium SHOTGUN, that hits you for almost full dmg without being in melee combat, which is highly frustrating to play against. This is just an example.   The principle of the game is still fun, but the P2W model ruins it a lot in my opinion.
521	1	a	Many people consider APB: Reloaded as a P2W game but it really isn't its more skill based you can kill maxed ranked players that own ARMAS Marketplace weapons with the starting gun. The default gun given is the most balanced gun in the game good for long range and close ranged. The Apparent P2W guns are obtainable for rent without paying but require Joker Tickets which you can obtain from fight club. Honestly I feel like this game is not P2W more like you need Skill2Win I would recommend APB to any other gamer out there.   People also forget the positive parts about APB: Reloaded which includes the games detailed character design. The customization in APB is by far one of the best due to the ability to make individual symbols and then place those symbols anywhere on a piece of owned clothing, car or graffiti. Regarding the Symbol editor you have amazing artwork for purchase from other players with in game money that could be tattoos, clothing details, car logos, anime characters, nsfw, guns, and other things.   Positives: - Great customization - Fun - Mailbox at Social District - That nice tingling sensation when you beat a maxed rank gold - Combat is more strategic then a point and click to kill shooter - GM's hold events occasionally and distribute GM Joker Boxes - Fight club for those who like instant action - Variety of guns in which each gun counters another just got to be smart on what you choose  Negatives: - About 1/3 of the cool clothing is armas - The fastest car in game with nitro is as fast as a potatoe (Feels like the max speed is 100kmph) - Occasional server lag - In game 13 yr olds that teabag - occasional hacker   Overall I rate APB: Reloaded 8/10
3021	1	a	IT HAS GUNS AND â¥â¥â¥â¥
5551	0	a	I would love to play it...if I could play it.
338	1	a	Very much like GTA, but less realistic
9800	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
10022	0	a	wont even show the launcher, looks good but wont work...
7157	0	a	Was great years ago, now it's dead/ not worth the time
5883	0	a	this game ruined my sound.

10707	1	a	it's ok
1360	1	a	.
8970	0	a	The game has absurd texture issues even after I tried various fixes, including many variations on the graphical options, the engine itself is buggy as hell, and for some reason the voices are completely distorted. If this game is ever fixed, I'll give it a better review, but with the way things are looking? Not gonna happen.
9811	0	a	
9475	1	a	Fallen Earth is an extremely clever game! It's mechanics are well defined, and thankfully free to play. It follows a traditional MMO pattern, but with it's own defining characteristic. A FPS or thirdps mechanic that works fantastic! Any MMO fan will feel at home here. It's crafting system is amazing, but if you are the kind of person who loves crafting, you might end up spending a lot of game time gathering the materials you need to build in game objects. PVP is good. Unfortunately there was only one game type that was generously populated, the rest having either zero or a handfull of players wanting to play it.   Since it's free, there's nothing wrong with checking it out! Be wery, the game glitched on a ATI Radeon 4300.
3004	1	a	good game over all great balanced f2p
1216	1	a	IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HATE IT ITS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LAGGY AND THERE ARE SO MANY HACKERS AND THEY JUST KEEP KILLING ME EVERYTIME I WALK OUT OF A SAFEHOUSE
3553	1	a	is amazing game but it is dieing this cant happen nooo i mean its like a smaller less known verson of gta online without all the trools AND MY SNIPER plz dont let this grate game die
5755	0	a	This game is'nt even worth trying, take it from me. Great concept, yet so many problems. 1.] Every 5 or so minutes the game kicks you. No matter what, making the game barley playable. 2.) I'ts a pay-to-win game. In reality it's not free, as you can't go halfway through teh game without paying. It's a waste of space. A waste of time. Wouldn't play it if it was the only game on earth. 0/10 go die in a hole pls.
7977	0	a	R-U-B-B-I-S-H!!!! i wont make a long review for a bad game, so heres why..: 1st: UNBALANCED GAME, i always found myself getting crushed by high-rank players 2nd: Unfriendly Community 3rd:This is the worst part.......HACKERS!!! Aimbots everywhere!!  So just dont install this game.....just DONT  
8445	0	a	One of the worst games ive ever played
4860	0	a	Its a pretty bad made game it crashes from 10 to 10 minutes :(
2788	1	a	Great game just needs to fix the bugs. has a lot of potential tho
5287	0	a	it sucked i didn't even get to play it. it took five ****ing days to install it and then 2 more days to ATTEMPT to make an acount. DON'T attempt to download this wast of electronic space &gt;:(
9889	1	a	Good points: A good storyline. OK FPS (shooter) Good FPS (frames) Good customization on characters. OK weapons.  Bad points: A LOT of trolls Tons of idiots A few glitches You can't get past a certain stage. It just crashes and I have a lot of RAM, storage and more.  7/10, tries to be Fallout, slightly fails, still OK game. 
9593	1	a	Been a pleasent suprise been looking at it for ages and decided why not! It turns out its a very fun game! also the crafting and pvp is very good fun!
5150	0	a	  Kat plays it so it bad, it hurt brain celss and iz full of hackerz
1041	1	a	Love it so fun but aim is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5468	0	a	Tried to be gta, failed.
10792	1	a	Reminds me of quake live, but with jetpacks and skiing which makes it 10 times awesome...er
8255	0	a	Pay to win.
2957	1	a	The game is fun
8601	0	a	Right well played the game for a while and i must say it could be fun if you enjoy unfear match ups and almost impossiable leveling up. The game could use some help in combat CUZ the headshots do same amount of damage and taking cover is ussless most of the time , custermizing is a ******* pain and finaly making money if you dont do ingame purchase is slow and repetative. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FOR ALL YOU LOOKING TO GET THE GAME DONT!!!!!!!!!
6686	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
10224	1	a	Definitely fun. Post apocalyptic MMOFPS with crafting and vehicles. It can get pretty deep. Graphics are just OK, but the game is fun so I never notice. It's also free to play.
2655	1	a	sehr cool 
3799	0	a	I know some of you are going to look at this and think, 2200 hours + and a negative recommendation, come on man, but please hear me out. I've been playing this game for a very long time now and have came to the ultimate conclusion that, yes, hackers rule all of APB, it 'IS' Pay 2 Win, and Gamers First will not do anything about it ever!  Now, here are the reasons:  1) Hackers are their primary source of income.  Need I say more?  Most of these guys that are hackers are little rich bleep nozzles who aren't good and instead of actually trying to get good, they buy hacks, and if I wasn't wiser, they're probably purchasing the hacks directly from the same people who run the freaking game.  I know this all sounds strange. But over the years I've played this, I've noticed so many hacks I didn't even know that many have existed. Walls, Aimbot, Lag Hacks, you name it, its in APB or has been.  And whats even funnier, oh ya'll are gonna love this.... The hacks seem to change out every couple of months or so. Its like they're on a subscription plan to hack! I have little doubt of that.  Now, if you throw money at this game, it helps you out dramatically. I use to think that, well, you can get these guns in the game with in game currency if you just play for long enough, but no... no, no, no, nooooo, this is not true. For example, you can buy an OCA with in game currency, however, if you use money to purchase an OCA Whisper, well, its about 3x better of a weapon from what I've experienced when using it.  I know some of you hackers, trolls, and others are going to downvote this, but w/e, it is what it is.  There are some things that make this game good, dont get me wrong. I think when it was first developed they had 'some' good intentions. I'm not sure how far those good intentions go however.  The good things about APB are, the customizations in the game are 2nd to none. Highly customize your car, your body, your clothes, even create songs and themes.  Another good thing is all the events that they hold. I really like that and I wish other games would do it more often. For example, they have a Halloween event, xmas event, and lots of others all throughout the year. Also they do special events. For instance, they just had an event where if you get so many kills a day, you unlock 20 Joker Mystery Boxes. It was cool.  Now, this is where the good things stop.  Ok, so one thing about the Joker Mystery Boxes, they hold special permenant weapons that you can unlock, however there is a slim chance of getting one. Actually, a way way way way way too slim of a chance of getting one. I unlocked 60 Joker Mystery Boxes and didnt get 1 permenant weapon. 60!  I feel bad for people who spend money on this game that dont hack honestly.  I feel bad for people who spend money on this game period. At least until Gamers First does something about the horrible hacking community they have in APB. Which, from the looks of things, they're never going to do anything about. Because like I said, refer to point 1) in the beginning of this review.  It all makes sense. They say, oh we implemented Fair Fight and that will take care of the hackers in APB. Yeah, well, Fair Fight only gets rid of the blatent hackers, the ones that skip all over the map... shoot a lot faster.... and get 30 kills and 0 deaths contantly. Problem is, theres so many more hackers that go undetected by Fair Fight, and most never get caught. And I'm guessing for good reasons too.  I really have had some good times in APB, but there's been way more bad times than good I can say. Mainly fighting the hackers. I just got out of APB and every match was against hackers, I mean come on, all I want is a decent match without hackers, is that so much to ask for?  One more thing, this game has lagging unlike any other. I'm not sure why, or how its possible that this is the 'ONLY GAME' that lags like this, but its really annoying. I sort of feel like the hacks have a big part to do with it honestly. I think the hacks are actually coded into the software itself and it compensates for them through lag to make up for the time.  Anyways.  If you're new, welcome to Hackworld. If you don't hack, I wouldn't even waste your time like I have unfortunately :(  Also, as a side note, the APB community is the absolute worst community I've ever experienced in the history of gaming. Absolute Worst!  All the legit players that I know wish and hope that this game will come around and that the hackers will be all gone and dealt with one day, but honestly, I just dont see that happening. They've made their choice. And instead of fixing that, they shove out more things for people to buy on the marketplace. Its disgusting really.  If they would just get rid of the hackers, this game could really shine and be a legitimately fun game that thousands of people would spend hours enjoying with their friends.  I'll continue to play this game until I get all the achievements, which isn't far from now, and also my criminal to 255, which is not far off. But after this, I won't be seeing much of this game anymore until Gamers First decides to actually do something about their disgusting community of hackers, trolls and the sorts.  If you'd like a list of  Games You Absolutely Must Have , check out our group here on Steam and we'll be happy to show you some alternatives to this mess.
4681	0	a	I have been playing this game on and off for about 5 years. Everytime I had to take a break from the game it was all because the hackers. -Speed hacks -Aim bots -Walls Much more...  Point is it's fun but the hackers have killed the game and made it suck balls.
2590	1	a	this game not playing in my pc
3387	1	a	This Is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ING Good game
4044	0	a	G1 ruins the game.
2760	1	a	Hundreds of hours, since the very first P2P release. Five stars.
5324	0	a	POSITIVE: Honestly digged this game and was addicted like crazy. reminds me of saints row but with a faction between bountyhunters and criminals. Game itself has some really awsome customization! you can spend hrs customizing your car/clothes/guns/music/spray tags/ and more! as a criminal you can mug people and break into stores and sell them for goods. as a bounty hunter you can pretty much go cat and mouse with the crims.  NEGATIVE: now that ive said how i first felt about the game and still do a little lemme explain a little about how they need to fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that actually makes you want to rage quit. first of all the tutorials SUCK! goodluck finding out how to do anything in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game unless you actually look it up on the internet or you have a friend on APB.   Next is the weapon and perk system. ok wtf. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing no way in hell can my character beat anyone whos been playing this game for months/years and they already have almost every damn perk in the game. and if its not the perks its the weapons. People brag constantly how much they spend actual money on the game just so they can kill you in 2-3 shots without using a sniper. oh and not to mention the HACKERS!!! its soo â¥â¥â¥â¥ing frustating!!!  i wanted to enjoy this damn game but theres no way i can play it when i either have to pay actual money to stay alive, or take constant losing for about 5 months until i can actually unlock powerful equipment! â¥â¥â¥â¥ that! There needs to be some kind of lvl measurment. oh wait! there is!   Threat level (trainee - bronze - silver - gold) which requires you to be stuck on certain servers to fit your gameplay rating. but if someone were to just constantly lose from gold and become silver and then silver to bronze or to have a group member whos bronze. then guess what. YOU ARE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED! as a trainee i fought countless golds and silvers and got my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me for days. heck weeks! and i kept getting mad at myself for not being good enough... until i finally realized it wasn't me, it was the game itself that no matter what strategy i did or used, if i wasn't properly equiped, i might as well shove my â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a blender because theres no way im â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anytime soon. lol.  CONCLUSION: I played for like about a good month until my gf and i killed eachother out of frustration, havn't played it since.  -The End
5256	0	a	No. I rarely write reviews but this was horrible. I'm sure it may have just been me, but this is my opinion. When i launched the game from steam, it came up with a launcher, which is fine, most games have those. they then opened over 15 tabs in my browser telling me to create an account. i did, and then they wouldnt let me mlog in, even when i activated my account. also, This is ver obiously a pay to win game.
10361	0	a	its crap
7635	0	a	COOL BUT CAN GET OLD
3096	1	a	love this game, honestly thought it would be bad but it is so amazingly fun to play with mates or by urself.
8274	0	a	Practically the best Pay to Win game ever! If you're broke, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! :D
9025	1	a	It takes a while to get used to, but you can do many things, graphics are like 'Play Station 1', besides who love building car/ATV's, or battling bots/player's(PVP), join clans......
8294	0	a	This game is an awesome idea,but there is just too many mistakes made in it.  First of all its complicated,atleast it was for me. No real tutorial rather than text. Pro players in starter area. Glitches. Pay to win.
1513	1	a	Great game! Try it out its free, nothing to lose, great graphics, gameplay and a lot of different customizations.
2286	1	a	This game although old is very fun and easy to get into. You start with 2 of the best wpns in game and through progression obtain any weapon, car, clothing you would need to sucessful w/o spending and RL money. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shooter games. I have over 600 hours so far in the game and still enjoy it (played a bit outside of Steam)
9182	1	a	I really saw potential in the gameplay. The first mission before you go open world was very interesting but the screen is just so messy in terms of menus and stuff. It annoyed me. But if you can look past that then you might find it pretty good
4337	0	a	Pay to win, as a noob you cant do â¥â¥â¥â¥ with the basic weapons you're given and you always get rekt by neckbeard players with OP weapons. Also theres no hit boxes, even if you shoot someone on the head it doesn't do more damage
7021	0	a	This Game Eat â¥â¥â¥â¥. He dosent let me login.
1223	1	a	i want to play but i dont know how to fix Not RESPONDING
7227	0	a	Had fun for many hours, until I realized that I kept on getting beaten by lvl 1's because they decided to be P2W and buy rocket launchers and all kinds of crazy â¥â¥â¥â¥.  This game is 80% P2W, and 20% actual fairness.
5628	0	a	This game is good apart from it takes ages to load and i cant even play it at the moment cos it keeps having to download directx
5939	0	a	this game sucks nuts dont bother getting it its much worse then warface
7893	0	a	Horrible game and company dont waste your money...both me and a friend got banned for absolutely no reason...we hadnt even PLAYED the game in over a year, suddenly we get on and their fairfight system bans us the second we log off? thats cool.  I spent like 3-400$ on this game, never playing their games again.  Email them try to follow up, and they basically say 'that sucks'  Started playing the game(looking over emails here), on 11/2/2012, never made it out of silver, never got any crazy stats with any of my weapons, i was better with some that others obviously but eh.  Then after almost 2 years of completely ON AND OFF play(mainly BECAUSE of hackers running around in the game), my friend gets on tells me about the fairfight system, and how he has not seen any hackers since, i get excited i hop on, play literally 1 mission log off and boom.

10471	1	a	I like the game, but my tutorial glitched and I can no longer do anything :/ so I might set this one aside for a while
1349	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!
10501	1	a	love tribes, hate hi-rez the sad truth
6062	0	a	I played this game for about a month (Don't mind the little play time on my steam account) and i can say this. Hackers everywhere, their servers are laggy as hell and with every update it gets worse. Next is the p2w thingy... If you are new to this game and don't want to spend any money on in than don't even bother playing it....  Edit 2015-06-12: Lags, Lags everywhere...
817	1	a	Imagine if you put aids and terminal cancer together, then made it a game this is what would come out of it.   Welcome to AidsPointsBulletin one of the worst managed free to play games you've ever seen. Bundled with the worst anti cheat anyone has ever seen in their life and players with brains as equally as smart as dead sperm cells.
8229	0	a	Crashing as often as it can.
6147	0	a	This game is basically the dictionary definition of pay-to-win. Not to mention the overwhelming population of hackers and 12 year old girls running around with stun guns. If you want to have a good time then it is in your best interest to click the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off this page and find another game.
7465	0	a	Well, this should be nice, but it's not working on Windows 7 64 bit...
1448	1	a	Drive by shootings. High speed driving on freeways and then hitting a ramp and soaring. Robbing shops like a boss. Shooting up Criminals like a boss. I like cars.
6485	0	a	buggy as hell and doesnt want to load the game and if you do get in the game you might get about two min with the game before it crashes. i dont recommend this game to anybody.
2267	1	a	Everything that's good about this game is also bad about it. Gameplay is very fun and simple, yet incredibly repetitive and plain; the level and weapon system is complex enough to give the player incentive to progress and its not p2w either, but at some point you're gonna understand that there's only 5 different missions in the game and you're doing the same sh*t over and over. Customization is one of the best out there, but guess what, you have to pay real $$$ to get the cool clothing items and customization slots.   At the end of the day though, there's no real reason not to try it. It is fun to play with friends, it is very competitive yet easy, and it also happens to be free to play.
8023	0	a	This game is an MMO. If that doesn't tell you what you should expect, probably stay away. If you like dying over and over again, this might be the game for you. I don't, which is why I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Frankly, this is not a review of the game so much as it is of the genre and the community. If you're the kind of person who can keep interest in this sort of thing long enough to get good, my review should mean nothing to you.  As for the rest? The people like me who joined too late/couldn't get the hang of it, and were thus deprived of all the fun this game had to offer? Well, if you're like me, you got interested in this based on style, color, and rampant, light-hearted brutality. You can find all that, plus a single-player or co-op environment that wants you to experience it, in the Saint's Row series. Saint's Row the Third and Saint's Row IV in particular are the closest to what I wanted out of APB. And go ahead and get the full package for the games as well, if you can. Having a tank right out of the tutorial sequence was EXTREMELY helpful and fun in 3.
8142	0	a	every time it launches the game keeps on saying reinstall so when i reinstalled it still didnt work
8501	0	a	Was great years ago, now it's dead/ not worth the time
6372	0	a	Personally find it extremely confusing. Driving is the weirdest ive ever experienced. Probably good if your pro in it. 3/10
8473	0	a	i might change my mind when i finally get it working. but for now it has been only annoying.
6644	0	a	The Servers for this game are very bad. EXTREME LAG its one of those games where if your new your not gonna be able to do anything
4055	0	a	240% more unclear than running blind. Tutorial is crap, stock gun is crap, 3/4 of the game is worse.
3645	1	a	Great game, as long as you are willing to spend your life savings on a single car.
7023	0	a	This game is nothing short of terrible. Was fun initially, then just went to hell VERY fast. Sad thing is this game had potential, but also has developers that suck.
3025	1	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T alot of the time but its unique in its own way. Lots of costumizations. i still love playing the game. i rage here and there but its nothing i still have fun
4712	0	a	I bought this game when it was just APB with Realtime Worlds.  It was frustrating then but enough people played to make it mostly enjoyable. I decided to give it another go and I just can't even get a foothold.  It's an uphill battle the whole way. Max rank, gold threat opposition every single game. Me and the sad team the matchmaking system would scrounge up for me would get trounced every game without fail.  You either have to buy some better gear (which I get the sense they count on), find a team that's good or slog through the grind until you can compete.  Long story short, this game is NOT beginner friendly.  I also need to add that the 'microtransaction' system is nothing close to micro. In fact, to purchase a gun it costs $20 upwards. That's just a single gun. They've taken the notion of a free to play system and add ons that are cheap and gone crazy.  They incentivise it at every turn as well. It's an impossible grind to obtain items unless you buy them. In many games you almost have to have the purchased weapons in order to compete when the other team is packing them. I'm sure most people would rather just buy a game outright and have everything the game has to offer, or at the very least not pay a price for additional content that rivals what a normal game's price would be to begin with.  It's a shameful, obvious cash grab. I would buy something if the prices weren't so outrageous. This system has strangled and alienated the community at a steady rate. I'd be surprised if within 2 years this game is still alive as a result.  ...Not to imply that the current community population could be considered 'alive.'
5352	0	a	JUST READ IT BEFORE YOU PLAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU FROM A MENTAL BREAKDOWN  F UCK.THIS.S HIT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALVUE YOUR SANITY.At first this game was awesome alright, having fun doing good stacking up the g's. Now my first thing i want to say is that there is A F UCKING R ETARDED GLITCH where when you buy a gun it will charge you for it 2-4 times losing the money you just spend 6 hourss working for. Next complain. ALOT OF THE PEOPLE, mostly the criminals, WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE F UCKING D IPSHIT A SSHOLES WHO FEEL THE NEED TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THER F UCKING MICRO P ENIS'. When your trying to earn chash,the point of the game, you'll have people who decive you, say they will help you and right before you are about to get money they will f ucking r ape you and give you their F UCKING AIDS so that you die and they can steal your money. Next, when your in a van your IMMEDEA TELY F UCKED; having a van basically says 'hey im transporting a s hit load of money come and f ucking get it you c unts'. Now that will trigger all the squeakers around you and they will immedeatly flock to your a sshole trying to wait for you to get out of your van to steal your it, the f ucked up thing is that you need to leave the van to stat making the money, not going to explain ho because it will take too long. Just image the scene from finding nemo with the seagulls, great now replace them with R ETARDED 7 YEAR OLDS. Ok, my final point is that one of the easiest ways to make money is ram raiding which is what i have been talking about mostly, when you have been sweating your a sshole off for the past century to the point where it's dicintegrating your gonna have a nice fat stack of chash available in the back of your van. When/If you get to turn this in with out the f uckboy's around stalking you. Your gonna be on the map if you have above 2.5k dollars. When you've been working THAT F UCKING LONG AND THAT F UCKING HARD AND YOU GET IMMEDEATLY F UCKED IN THE A SS AND YOUR MONEYS BEEN STOLEN YOUR SOUL GETS SUCKED OUT OF YOUR A SS AND YOU WASTE 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE ME WRITING A RAGE REVIEW ON STEAM BECAUSE ANGER IF THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. And so concludes my review/essay on why never the play this CANCER GAME.
5179	0	a	APB:RELOADED is the BEST GAME EVER.. For the spoiled children and Trolls. For the people who VALUE their time,it's a game that makes you nothing but mad.
9030	1	a	I haven't liked most of Steam's F2P games, but I was pleasently surprised with this one, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great. It's free, so it's not like you've lost anything.
10203	1	a	It is a fun game. The controls are a bit wonky but it is free and more good than not
4339	0	a	THIS GAME IS JUST CANCER, IF PEOPLE CANT SEE THAT THIS GAME IS PAY 2 WIN THEY CAN KISS SOMEONE SPECIAL. FOR ALL THE NEW GUYS WHO DECIDES TO JOIN THIS GAME BECAUSE IT LOKS LIKE ALOT OF FUN, THINK AGAIN! IF YOU JOIN THIS GAME U HAVE TO BE PREPERED TO WASTE LIKE 100$ TO LIKW EVEN KILL ANOTHER PLAYER WHO HAS EVERYTHING.
10109	1	a	This game, despite its few bugs that dont 'bug'me very much at all (haha) is one of the best mmorpgfps's ive ever played.  Its emmersive its competetive you dont need to purchase things with reall money to have fun (just to show off) the character development is greatly in depth with the things that effect others the amount of things to learn is somewere in the millions theres something new to discover every day it can be played almost endlessly for years (ask the very first players that are STILL playing)  the list goes on.  I strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes open world, in depth, post apocalyptic, competitive, play forever mmorpgfps that is free to play.  Well done developers  P.S.- all you naggers out there who down the game for its tiny little bugs need to focus on the good things more, not the bad things.  Your's Truly, Tajaloe
10225	1	a	Like Fallout but multiplayer :D
7526	0	a	Pros:  - Fun Gunplay (to a certain extent)  - Extremely indepth customization.  Cons:  - Balancing issues (Certain guns can 1/2 shot lower level vehicles.)  - Terrible Matchmaking system. (Someone with &lt;1 hour of gameplay can get matched with someone of &gt;3000 hours.)  - Server Issues  
4286	0	a	um its ok as long its playeble.But um gamer first nope.
205	1	a	I'm going to go ahead and play the optimist on this one. Try it for a bit till you get mad at it, because you'll probably still get mad at it as you go on.   Though as you can probably see, i likely didn't miss much from when i stopped playing it.  As it was, I found myself having to go shirtless and run amok through the town, doing GTA like BS.  That was true to a point. If you were on a sever with low cops, you could go nuts. But on a populated server, you could just miss a turn and hit a store by accident and the player cops would be on you like flies on â¥â¥â¥â¥.  While i'm sure they rebalanced things, back then it was more advisable to kill yourself countless times than to fight back.  Anyway, again, try it for a week or two, get mad at it and wish you hadn't.
2660	1	a	Best F2P shooter, despite the ongoing server issues and the 'youthful spirited' community.
7796	0	a	This game, haha, let me get started. This game is a good game, I like the concept of the game, but it is purely, Pay to Win. The tutorial helps you little to none, I had a hard time figuring out how to even change cloths, it's also REALLY buggy. Besides after spending 15 hours on one character I got banned by Punkbuster for having, 'A Bad Driver' on my computer, this game in my opinion is a waste of time and space.
1759	1	a	A decent game imo to have fun with your friends :), try it out and see!.
1947	1	a	My friend wants me to play it but I dont want to because of high ping :3 8/10
7237	0	a	Would have recco'd but takes for ever to update Engine scene is dead. VVGT
9304	1	a	Basicly Fallout online but not because of copyrights ;P
3831	0	a	Pros +Uninstall works perfectly  Cons -Too much P2W -Cancer team m8s,community. -Matches ranking unfair -Everyone gets a bazooka and destroy you dont matter how skilled are you at the game  9/11 Would uninstall again
731	1	a	better than most mmo's that i have played
3690	1	a	this game is the best
2938	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
9069	1	a	its just too bad there isnt enough people playing this game. thats what kind of killed it for me. felt like I was playing single player lol. Aside from that, pretty awesome game. I may or may not come back to it.
225	1	a	Very nice game ;D
6071	0	a	P2W Reloaded  P2W=Pay to win just in case you ask
2148	1	a	this game is awesome! love the Customization in it, and its just really fun driving around as a cop :D lol!! highly recomend ^_^
8276	0	a	Pay to win but in its own fashion, its one of those games were u cant tell if u will like it untill u play it allthough i did not like it would i recommend it, no but u may still like it.
9353	0	a	Just don't play it. It is a waste of time.
3471	1	a	Noice game over all tbh
3193	1	a	Heavily reliant on your RAM. Synchronization is server-based rather than client based, so when you press W it takes an extra half second for you to move forward. Once you get used to the slight lag, it's a wicked good game dude.
5108	0	a	Was even effort put into this? I would rather say that all they did is just make the graphics good... there is about a thousand bugs and new players cannot even kill one enemy because of everyone buying weapons for real cash and be OP... So this game  IS NOT RECCOMENDED EVEN TO TRY!
551	1	a	Honestly id say its a great game, ive had alot of good hours in this.  Easy to get into a clan, meet some people and enjoy some hours in missions. But then again boring alone, full of trolls like everyother game, not just to get started on the toxic players in this game. Cheaters included. Some says its p2w but id say it pay to look good. Most of the guns in armas are reskins, every gun can be beaten so i wouldnt listen to that.  Then again it gets boring in the long run, mostly the same things over and over, so be creative and have some fun with friends and its an enjoyable game.
4236	0	a	I CANT PERNIMANTLY BUY GUMS WITHOUT REAL MONEY!... otherwise the game is ok.
5598	0	a	It says I have 4 hours, but that is not the case. Those 4 hours are from the game not opening properly. I have not had a chance to see any actual gameplay, but from my experience with the game as far as I had gotten, I wasn't going to continue. Many people have complained about the dev, and I kinda agree! Don't play this.
3140	1	a	this game is well made and its fun to play and blow tings up
3919	0	a	since the G1C spike and gamers first yet â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ another great P2P game i will say this.  this game is fun to a point... the game lags online syncing issues and also the fact that  Armas weapons and a variety of other things make this game unbalanced. not to mention  they are using PUNKBUSTER of all anti hacks that any script kiddie with the iq of a rock  can bypass and make aimbots ruin the overall experience. i blame the minor part of the  gamer community that plays FB games and the ever popular 'micro transactions' â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the rest of the experience for all of use. well here we go.. the games physics sucks... a small jump can turn your car over which seems to be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blimp with wheels.  animations or horrible. the other thing.... customization for free users to limited and requires you to get premium for a half way looking decent character. premium costs 5 dollars to 400G1C. also... your are going to hate people after playing this because the ammount of trolls and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s kill you with a  small burst from a smg or other fire arm while you have the dumb â¥â¥â¥ shit little 556 rifle they give you and expect you to kill something with it. so you get through the tutorial get a new gun play missions get new gear car etc.  the issue left is money you need alot of money get get anything decent. so formula higher rating you have more money you get, lower rating lower money. so.. hell if you have a few dollars anyways... and you dont want to listen to me go on play it.  but as a community ambassador i say to you not to play this filth please.... just dont there are so many better games out there... the community for this game is alright.. but trust me when i say this just dont bother.. sure its addicting and fun to play with freinds. but play it alone for a little when you play with freinds you will over look things but alone you will see why this game is terrible and how you die fast. i almost forgot..... weapons you buy WILL EXPIRE! you want weapons that dont expire PLAY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME GET A REWARD TO CHOOSE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PERMA WEAPON... sorry that is all good bye...
2013	1	a	I can shoot da guns n hurt pplz 10/10 plz nerf power shots tho,too mlg
10598	1	a	This game has been one of the best FPS games that I have ever played! It is free too, which is a great bonus. You could pay money if you want to get more classes or weapons faster, but when you start playing, it is really easy to get those! Highly recommend this game! 20/10
1557	1	a	Very realistic game. Recommending it for everyone.
4322	0	a	This game is fun and all, it's just that there's so much that could be fixed. There's way too many hackers in this game and the developer's just made an automatic ban system to ban the hacks that are known to the system.   Also let's say that you've played 6 missions in a row, won them all, great stats &amp; all that. Your next mission can cause you to quit the game entirely because of bullsh!t game mechanics killing you, enemy team teaming up and playing the game way too competitive or just get tickled to death by a nano or whatever.   I've had so much fun in this game but now it's just like tip of a pen that's running out of ink. No more ink = No more fun.  I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends unless they've played it and can handle or have experienced utter sh!t mechanics f*cking you over and over again.  If there wasn't any customization in this game i would've never spent all the hours that i have now.
4445	0	a	It's pay 2 win......what else do you expect from free steam games?
7184	0	a	All I see in Merry Elfin' Christmas. I feel like I should just go back to fantasy MMOs. Also, I cannot find my pants.  &gt;1/10
5912	0	a	WTF DONT WASTE TIME  SUCH BAD POOPOODOODOO

2932	1	a	If your short on money or just want to have fun, this is the game for you. When you start up the game, you are told that some city somewhere has gone into complete anarchy. The government has passed a bill that allows vigilantiasm to try and bring down the crime rates. You are then told to choose a side 'Criminals' the Anarchists, who can Mug people for money, steal cars and sell them for money or plow there cars into store windows and steal all of the items that fall out and sell them for money. Or you can choose the 'Enforcers' the vigilanties, who can do missions for money. They can still 'Steal' cars but they have a special badge that makes it ok. You then create your character and give him/her a name and you are ready to play. Basically you roam around the city waiting for a mission to pop up. When one does, people from around the city are randomly selected and put onto two teams. (Recomendation cut short because steam caps the character limit) basically its good dl it.
6777	0	a	the game that has potential and ruined by two companies; hackers and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ comunity
1719	1	a	Action-packed, easy to learn (but hard to master), lots and lots of customization options (even without paying for anything). It's what an MMO shooter should be.
9058	1	a	Best Apocalypse Sandbox MMO out there ... oh and it's Free 2 Play !
1535	1	a	Best Game ever you dont need to pay a thing
6281	0	a	  What aload of crap
8711	0	a	Has potential but it is empty , souless and NOT fun. Would have been great if others (GTA/Saints row IV) had not already beaten them to it.
1923	1	a	I do recommend this game to all of you but i enden up playing it so much that i got banned, I was really good at the game and i would never intend to hack. But i only lost about 200 dollars and g1 gave me no refound so its okay i guess. Go ahead and try it the chance of being banned for not doing anything is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tiny i have 10 alternative accounts :D
9854	1	a	Most people will compare this instantly to the Fallout series, the only thing they share in common as far as I'm concerned is the Post Apoc setting for the world. The game plays more like Neocron, Hellgate London or STALKER.  The game play requires some getting used for people who've never played a hybrid interface game as there is a toggle between Aim/Fight mode and RPG mode. In Aim/Fight mode the game behaves like a FPS. While in RPG mode the mouse cursor is free so you can click on menu items, objects, and such. Many people make the mistake of skipping the tutorial, a really big mistake as a lot of the basic how to's are taught through the tutorial.  Fallen Earth literally has a spider web of story especially in Sector 1 (the beginners sector) where various stories from starter towns and the later higher level towns actually come together or are related enriching the experience. Much more to say, but not much space left to type. . . give it a honest try and enjoy it for what it is
5961	0	a	I would love to play it...if I could play it.
10272	1	a	pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥!
4919	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
1156	1	a	This game is cool =) I spend 400e for G1C and destroyed 4 keyboards =)
8135	0	a	Hackerfest and the absolute definition of pay to win...steer clear of this game the best you can. The company is absolutely horrible and cares nothing about their customers. They rip people off on a usual basis and are pro-cheater as they consider cheaters paying customers. Additionally, the servers are very shoddy and lag on a fairly consistent basis.
71	1	a	never played it but here is my review
5946	0	a	I hate this game! This game make my PC slowly and it a â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME! Game suck ! 
6187	0	a	nah not my kind of game
1794	1	a	love this game!
9168	0	a	i know i have no play time for this game but that is exactly why im writing this review. let me start from the begining, i wait 2 days for this game to download(slow internet) and its done so i start the game and it asks me to create a account so i go and fill in all the required stuff and wait for the verification email, get the email and open link, then i get a error, this page cannot be found, so i redo it again and same problem, tried at least 4 times, keep getting the same error. now i see why it has so many negative reviews
4256	0	a	Best character creation to date.
211	1	a	IT is a cool game   
5536	0	a	This Pay 2 Win Game gets boring quickly because of shooting people over and over again they could host more events but they're too lazy to do that because they're 'making' weapons and making huge prices for them if you think this game is Free 2 Play then you are WRONG this game will not let you progress through it without BUYING it
78	1	a	Good Game And Fun.
4688	0	a	Insanely grind or pay 2 win. Creators, you could make this game not free 2 play and remove that stupid premium â¥â¥â¥â¥ and etc.. because not its imposible to play.. rich â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ are just chilling with premium stuff, when poor people get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ toxic and angry and everything, because they cant buy every gun they want for real money.
1972	1	a	For a game that pisses me off and I get called a hacker for using a sniper that has the capability to kill someone through a slight corner with a well aimed shot, I like it. The customization, the weapons, and the cars are great, but being able to gun down an enemy just feels better! I'd have to recommend playing with a team though. Gets lonely lol.
9784	1	a	If you are one of those 100% completion types, this will keep you occupied for a very very long time. i have over 200 hours in this game, and i still haven't even left the first major area. and i still have quite a bit more to do yet before i will move on.    also good if you are a cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like me. all that time in, and i've spent no real money. i may not ever(sorry devs) because i can gather and craft anything i might need.   not for the impatient. some things can take a very long time(days) to craft, and only one at a time.
5073	0	a	Pay to win.
2380	1	a	Great game in my opinion ... :3
1374	1	a	This game is really fun. Though im really bad playing it with keyboard. Think im going with xbox 360 controller ( which i believe its good for some people like myself ). I recommend this game to anyone interested in 3rd person shooting games. Play if you like GTA, Sleeping Dogs and Crackdown
10069	1	a	Great game. Fair for F2P Graphics - meh  
2272	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
7824	0	a	A glorified, pay to win version of cops and robbers in which to kill someone you have to run around like a madman and throw explosives at anything that moves. also, your guns do as much damage as flicking a pea.
10192	1	a	this is a fun moltiplayer game with blood and guts :)
9610	0	a	â¥â¥â¥
7421	0	a	i use to think this was alright, but now i cant even load up the game
4214	0	a	This game has a fantastic concept. Free, open-world, full customization of your character, go on missions with new people; all this stuff makes for a pretty fun game...but the game is extremely unbalanced. Because of this inbalance, it has caused more rage than it has fun. When you are matched against players that are on your level, it is very very fun. But the chances of this happening are extremely slim. Chances are, when you are starting out, you'll be against so players with better skill, better weapons, and better experience. If you don't pay for the bonus weapons, you're going to fall behind and it'll take quite a while for you to catch up to the players that you get matched with. Often times when I play this, I think about how much more fun I could have playing something else where the matchmaking isn't so imbalanced.
10606	1	a	fast game and i am no kinding in one game the tables can tourne i really loved it but the matches and maps or o.K
2780	1	a	The worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing imbalanced crappy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ you could ever play.Stay far away and let it die once and for all.good game for griefers,trolls amd hackers.
5718	0	a	Long loading screens, many time wasters, worst game ever. I deserve some hash browns.
4429	0	a	OMG THIS GAME IS THE BOMBA I JUMPED OVER THE BORDER,AND TRIED IT WITH AN STOOL,SO YAH XxLOLZORXx
3635	1	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game.   I can also run The Witcher 3 in Ultra with 60 fps
8206	0	a	I try to play and just didn't work at all and i have a good computer for games.
4717	0	a	Character Customisation = Dank Uninstall Button = Dank
10719	1	a	Favorite game by far for the last 3 years and cant wait for the new updat they just announced
9643	0	a	Terrible... This game has lag, poor character movements, and not enough of a character setting. I recommend you get TERA instead that game is so mch better

1985	1	a	is a good apg game 2ond opticks but the bullet damage is the same on the headshot and the body . thats all i have to say
2688	1	a	Great game
7145	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
626	1	a	Been playing this game for over 2 years. Yes like every game this game has flaws, and YES we complain about it everyday, but its sooooo addicting that it makes us come back the next day. It has both action and social features, the game has one of the best desigining features in the history of games, i would prefer it if ur a artist too and I would really recommend this game for open world game players, plus its really close to GTA multiplayer... Better actually :)
7272	0	a	This game is the 1 of the biggest POS games iv played in a while it automaticly made me a account and set the date to 2015 so cant even play it on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ list it right next to nether witch i can nolonger play cus it did almost the same thing but its linked to my steam account so i cant make a new account
5734	0	a	So many hackers. If you don't hack you will be used hard.
4265	0	a	If your a hacker. Play this game cause there literally is no hacker prevention here. If your a regular player, avoid this game at all costs. Until removal of all hackers, game will remain bs unless played with friends.
7970	0	a	?
9965	0	a	you should probably make sure your game doesnt lag to hell when you look at an entity... especially when a large bulk of the game is combat oriented. im not wipinng myself with this game unless they fix the lag issue. its bad enough that they make the player wait for a dogs age waiting for updates and a million agreements. if the lag wasnt a problem however it would be pretty good.
9533	0	a	At first, I was like 'Ah hell, it's free, why not?' An hour later I'm bored â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4096	0	a	This game is good, but we want to costum must buy -_-
6799	0	a	this didnt work. it just took up room and now i cant delete it 
3261	1	a	great game
5495	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
5364	0	a	pay 2 win but its fun somtimes unless the people you verse have there moms credit cards as weapons
8281	0	a	APB Reloaded a fps good for anyone that wants to play a cops vs criminals,Awesome gameplay nice graphics good music and sound its almost perfect but its the wors game I`ve ever played cause its unplayable you cant spawn in a district or play only 1 hour cause the game crashes every 1 second I dont know why cause I played it before and it was better and had no crashes now it fells like the game is a beta not a full game because of the many crashes I tried everithing turning down the graphics and resolution and didnt work so Dont waste time on this game
2627	1	a	Weird combat. still a good game fun to crush and be crushed.
3993	0	a	Game was going fine for a moment, until PunkBuster decides to kick me out of the district for no reason.   Uninstalling this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. I knew that this game is not good yet.  0/10 because PunkBuster is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1680	1	a	This Game Is only fun with friends but if you are anti social and want to play a dumbed down GTA clone with other people this game is perfect for you
6742	0	a	If you enjoy constantly being pitted against players far above your skill level without your say and losing many, many matches before you even get a grip on how the game works, then this is your game. The matchmaking system is so flawed, it has effectively driven away anybody who might pose a fair, but not punishing, challenge against you.   Because of the matchmaking, this game has two difficulties in essence: Stupid Easy and Stupid Hard. Pick your poison.  The gameplay itself doesn't have much to it. Just level up contacts, shoot at some players once in a while, and do the same set of fetch quest, ram raid, or deathmatch objectives pretty much every mission. That is the meat of the game, and it's not subject to negotiation The game is based around PvP, and normally, it would be something you could have a bit of fun with after gathering up a few friends and duking it out in the streets like you're supposed to. But then we come back to the matchmaking issue, which takes the aspect of 'fair competition' and chucks it straight out the window.   It's also not a very well optimized game. I can accept when a game is simply too intense for my PC to handle, but this game certainly shouldn't be on the list of 'I need to turn A LOT of settings down before I can play' games. I'm not running on a potato, either. It's just terribly optimized. So, word of warning, do not expect to run this at high and get smooth frames on anything less but the most rugged of gaming rigs with a lot of resources to burn.   The best thing I can say about it, really, is the customization. It truly is the one aspect that takes this mediocre game a step up into the realm of competitively mediocre. 'Course, don't expect to make any particularly insanely awesome character outfits without dropping real money or grinding the game's endlessly monotonous objectives, all while battling the world's worst player matchmaking system.  Until this game gets its crap together with the supposedly upcoming engine update, I can't recommend this title, even in its free-to-play format. Play it if you want, but prepare to get annoyed.
7106	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Fun with friends. (sometimes)
601	1	a	One of the best games ever.
4540	0	a	I personally would not recommend the game. This is because of the fact that the matchmaking system sucks since a lot of the veteran players like going up against new players since it's easy. Also the fact that people do hack and the devs seem to not care.
5094	0	a	honestly just a waste of youre time
8591	0	a	Boring
10574	1	a	I am happy to say that Tribes is a fun game again! Before, Tribes was full of bugs and abandoned by Hi-Rez when they began making Smite. Now, they have began updating it again and many of the players have returned (including me)
4011	0	a	1st take - If you're not willing to spend real money it is pretty much unplayable. Hacking,macro cheating, and golds purposely farming lowbies galore. Maybe if G1 got their act togethor i would say its a worthwhile game...but they're making to much money off the p2w guns to even care.  2nd take - Fairfight solved some of the hacker problems, but i still would not recommend this game yet. Only good thing going for it at the moment is the sheer amounts of customization. But there is still to many glaring problems that needs to be addressed.  1.Matchmaking - The matchmaking in this game is atrocious, it makes leagues matchmaking system look flawless ( and thats bad) . Odds are you will be placed against people who are gold and R255 while you are just starting out. (even if you go to bronze servers they're still there)  2. Armas Weapons - This is the big one, Armas weapons is a double edged sword. Yes it is whats keeping the game afloat since it brings in revenue. But also its whats making the game completely unbalanced. Though i would think this could be easily fixable by adding ranks to the armas weapons, so a brand new character cant run around with a shaw 'first blood'.  3. This ties into 1, but the fact golds can stay in bronze servers. This could be easily fixed that once you hit gold you are automatically booted out of the server.  4.They need to find a way to hire actual GM's , cause there's is a load of people who need to banned just for the way they act in this game. If players were actually afraid of losing all their work and the real money they spent on armas. Maybe the community would be less toxic.  These are only some of the problems, maybe after these are fixed i could actually approve this game to new players.
2236	1	a	Best troll simulation. Great game, community makes it hilarious, a couple of weapons can seem very p2w, you will rage if you're easily angered by games, Criminals seem to have the most veteran players, Golds (rank) will trash talk when they beat you and trash talk when they lose (X'D), Everything from your character to your car is EXTREMELY customizable, you can say what you want and create what you want, people will not help you unless you can further their wins, people with rpgs will spam rpgs and then talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ because you died by their rpgs, kids play this (not sure if majority, hard to tell), guys play as girls to get attention and help from veteran players (a method many players now take), as starting out you will most likely get put up against a silver by 60% and golds by 40% depending on time of the day (More golds on at night and in the morning), if you are good at this game you will be called a hacker a lot, nobody in this game plays for fun (but me), game was made by real time worlds (great company) but then game was given to trolls, who bred more trolls and now this game is full of trolls young and old. In all I suggest this game for the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles, but not for a serious gamer. Good luck. Did I mention it's free to pla--- troll?
6599	0	a	great game, or atleast if would be if it wasnt pay to win and stuck on a rent system with your gear. i dont like having to re purchase guns because i cant play regularly to keep them from expiring
2527	1	a	nice game but driving sucks big time!
6579	0	a	~This review was original a recommended review for this game on 22 May, 2012~ The worlds best Free game.  ~New Review 2014, June~ I spend so many hours on this game that's unbeliveable. We have gone through bad times, good times, we've cried together, laughed together, and just been together since RTW release. I've meet new friends, found enemies, rivals which I've had so much fun with, when we found each other against each other again after days. And I've now came to the point, that this game is a zero. After Gamersfirst took over this masterpiece, is jumped down a hole where it hasn't hit the ground yet, and it's just a matter of time till the ground is visible. After every release, the game gets more and more bugs, and the server performance is getting worse. It's so hard for me to down vote this game, but.. I would lie if I did anything else.  Pros; - Had a lot of potential. - Had one of the best playerbases I've seen.  Cons; - Performance. - Servers. - Support. - The AI's - G1 is not willing to listen to the community, and is basicly ignoring them. - Only content updates, and rebates for their items which cost real money. - Outdated Anti-cheat program. - Outdated game-engine, 'Dosen't matter that much to me, but a upgrade would help them optimizing the performance'.  *At this point I just hope that G1 are willing to sell it, to a company who will safe it, while it's still falling down the hole, even though I think it's to late*
8698	0	a	.|. 
1564	1	a	APB Reloaded is a F2P version of an old game APB. Theis version ghas better graphics and more content. You shuold totally play this game, here's why: Character customization Vehicle customization Intensivity Freedom 9.5/10
9840	1	a	yes it is a good fallout like game 
10775	1	a	Hirez has shown they are capable of being a very good company. A year ago if you asked any tribes player that a full update would take place with class changes, weapon and class balancing, new maps and new weapons you would have been seen as crazy. The new update is by no means perfect but is one well done. This game is very much worth it especially to new players. Despite its steep learning curve the community is well accepting of newbloods (new players) and offer multiple mumble servers in many that allow players to learn the ropes and take part in more competitive play. Unlocks also seem to be free for now so joining in now will not put you at a disadvantage. 8/8 gr8 blupl8 m8. 
10726	1	a	I hear the developer is going to revive this game soon
1814	1	a	Run around in a pair of briefs and a tie while cops yell at you to do something criminal.  10/10
5453	0	a	Make sure your underwear is as â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered as possible.
4465	0	a	Unique game with potential ruined by incompetent team of weeb chimps.
3162	1	a	there were several bugs, but now its awesome! :3  cool with friends
10752	1	a	Kind of hard to play, graphics were good at the time however. Also its was fun overalll, would recommend 8.5/10
9324	0	a	No its just bad i had bugs, alot of em. also its content is just Crap! Worth your time? Nope
3814	0	a	Don't bother trying out this game.  I downloaded this game and it appear to be that they had a server merge and I tried to talk to support about my account and they refuse to restore my account and now I am unable to login   Let's put this straight 'they don't give a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you'
4472	0	a	It's a terrible game the trailers are all lies some guns are too OP and the strategy to this game is to attack and run away there is no way i could take enjoyment out of this game mainly because its a big â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-canoe and it...Just sucks stay away from this
4542	0	a	Worst 'free to play' game ever. Dont you even try playing this piece of poop. It will suck all your money.
7751	0	a	If you want to have fun then this is the perfect example of a game not to play.
4993	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.
5949	0	a	I have just downloaded the game, and i can't even create a character before i get disconnected. I't keeps saying it might be connection error, but that can't be it because i can play all other online games without any problems with connection.
5913	0	a	This game is confusing, no really, I don't understand anything
5922	0	a	look in my screen shots that will explain why the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
48	1	a	It is awesome and i love the customization options everywhere with clothes, cars, weapons, symbols, music, themes, srays and many more HOWEVER.... the PvP sucks BIG time, the enforcers are too weak and the criminals are to over powered with a ton of damage and they have to lower the damage delt by criminals... I mean.... do you really think criminals will have the upper hand in reality?  Yep, i rest my case :| oh well, i still like playing it but the PvP system needs to be changed or else this game will become dead to me :|
10457	1	a	Great F2P Game!!
8958	1	a	The game is very good, I'm Russian, so I can not fully enjoy the story, since I can not translate all fully ... Please add the Russian language in the game ...
5485	0	a	+Good game for fans of Saints Row and GTA +Nice graphics  +Awesome music  -Launcher is bugged its never turn of untill restart Steam -Keep counting hours spend in game even if not playing it -Classic P2W -Can't delete account even if you ask support
3276	1	a	It's a very good game. But it's (very) hard for newcomers. Some people say it's pay 2 win - nope it's definitely not P2W. People say that when they are losing and going mad about it (They're using excuses like 'This game is P2W' or 'You're Hacker' or they say that the weapons are unbalanced.) This game is fun, you must enjoy it and have fun while playing (with your friends or even alone) If you'll decide to play APB i recommend doing all tutorial tasks, trying every weapon you can and bringing some friends with you :D (use team speak 3)  Remember - Stay cool, never give up and don't go mad
5188	0	a	APB Reloaded. It's like the original APB, but driven straight into the ground so no one can enjoy it now.
6688	0	a	i made an account, went to validate my account , it said 'page not found ' i repeated it couple of times... didn't work, i went for help to the website but to get help i need to be logged in... 10/10 amazing gameplay (sarcasm)
4093	0	a	The only way you could have fun is by paying the micro transactions. All in all, this is pay 2 win.
6171	0	a	Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. Hackers everywhere and so P2W avoid this game at all costs.
2293	1	a	Best game 11/10 Thanks g1 for good quality game. Only g1c i hate its fookin expensive .-.
8993	0	a	This is the worst game i hav ever played... waste of bandwidth
4716	0	a	Does't work so I can't recommend it.
9274	0	a	Its free, no game should EVER need to update in game. if your going to download it over steam NEVER EVER EVERRRRRRRR MAKE YOU SIGN UP ON A ALTERNATE WEBSITE AND HAVE TO UPDATE IN GAME. other than that i have not even played the game because of that!
4790	0	a	Nearly all of the hours I have in this are updates.
10783	1	a	This is by far the best game I have ever played.
615	1	a	good game not the best but one u can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around on
779	1	a	this is a fun game you go around and shoot ppl stell cars play as a cop or a crook XD its pirtty fun sorda reminds me of gta :D hope some of u guys get it glhf :D
372	1	a	I found out about this game through my 'random links' method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled 'A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions'         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions&nbsp;
7135	0	a	this game does not work any more so do not down lad this games please.
190	1	a	While not the best sandbox game around, APB Realoaded gives you a great online world for you to play in with your friends! The map list is a bit short at the moment but this can easily be fixed with updates. The Character creator also is very nice and has some depth to it, allowing you to make a really unique character. The microtransactions are a pain but they can easily be ignored. Weapons are also a pain as you can only buy them temporarily unless you spend real money but this also doesn't ruin gameplay, as the starting weapons are pretty good. Veichles also have a decent amount of customizeation, letting you put your own logos on and you alos use those same logos on your clothing or as tatoos!
8311	0	a	God Awful. I have been playing this game for like a month or 2 and it f***ing sucks. Sure you can customize weapons and cars n' stuff but the online gameplay just sucks. I ready in and wait 30 minutes for a mission and my other teammates wont even do the mission, they kill me when I try doing something(friendly fire X_X) and tell me they're 'priming'(from what i heard is not doing â¥â¥â¥â¥ untill a police force comes to the scene) and yelled at me for being a noob. I as a rookie game developer tell the developers 'you're doing great with customization, but PLEASE set up a better matchmaking system'. for the players i say 'Just play GTA Online, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ just sucks'. oh and one more thing developers 'WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY RENT GUNS'. thank you
8616	0	a	It doesnt seem to work on steam? I suggest downloading the launcher from the APB webpage.
4756	0	a	Very laggy not worth trying it... Also maid my laptop frezz and gave it bugs
6223	0	a	Can't login useing steam
4135	0	a	i give it a 4 out of 10 its not that bad its just repetitive otherwise it would be a great game
6973	0	a	who the hell would buy a 100$ dlc for this game
7592	0	a	This game... this game is partially unique. But there are SERIOUS problems.  1) There's no tutorial of any kind, you get put straight into a lobby with real people. 2) Those real people almost always have sniper rifles, or a gun that fires faster than yours. Basically, 9/10 times, you're pretty screwed. And those peopleare the ones you have to do missions against! 3) The cars handle like GTA 3, with the tyres popped. On ice. 4) The interface is astonishingly confusing, and like I mentioned before, there's no tutorial. The game assumes you know what you're doing. 5) The mini-map in the corner doesn't show buildings, or anything of much use. The only thing you can really tell is whether someone is behind you or not. But you don't need a map, you have a sniper bullet in your skull for that.  That's just five of the many, many problems this game has.  I highly recommend...Not getting this. Even though it's free, and does supply a bit of a laugh with friends, it isn't much of a game. It's like a concept for GTA.  **EDIT - And I still have no idea what APB stands for.
4731	0	a	This is pretty much just a poor man's GTA Online.
5647	0	a	It wont work and its a sorry â¥â¥â¥ excuse of a GTA copy. It can suck my 8====D
8008	0	a	I did not recommend this game it's Pay to win
1273	1	a	As long as you play criminal, the game is fun.  If you play cop, the game is a constant grind because it is so incredibly hard to make money.
5455	0	a	not fun no more 200+ time played
2922	1	a	Go ahead punk, make my d- OH GOD HE'S PAYING TO WIN, HELP!
1306	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gay game it would not let me play i could not chose a world
5681	0	a	This is the best game ever.....If you're not new to it.   Decent game ruined by yet another play to win model.
9702	0	a	Seriously, don't install this piece of trash.
10593	1	a	awsome fast and epic all I have to say
2913	1	a	You should definetly try this one , since its the best Free to play on steam.Its not a gta mmo but its close , diferent and good.
2566	1	a	this is a great game!!!!
6378	0	a	IN my opinion this is just another one of those games that look like gta V's ugly cousin :v
8048	0	a	The only problem i had, was the biggest one. MY SCREEN WOULD NOT STOP SPINNING. Everytime i tried to move my screen spun. everytime i got in game, my screen spun.
6707	0	a	:(
9776	0	a	This game has horrible button layout and the story makes no sense
9779	0	a	pretty bad considering its a grind game and it is not a survival
417	1	a	If you want a Grand Theft Auto type game, GET APB RELOADED. This game has amazing missions as a police storyline or as a gangstar storyline. If you think the Cops are the 'goodie-goodie' type, you thought wrong. The Cops also have the capability to beat up citizens, so they are definitely not to be overlooked. The gangstar storyline is your classic gangstar with the girls (or guys depending on your gender), the theft, the beating up, mugging. Massively Multiplayer. Action. FREE 2 PLAY. Get it while it lasts.
7935	0	a	As of now i cant even spawn i try over and over and i can't spawn and until they fix this i would not recomend unless you would like to sit through 5 minutes of loading screens for the game to crash.
8843	0	a	I've saw other people saying this is a bad game, I bet it is, but I'll just try it. That is why I got an extra bit of ram to play this game for my birthday.
2006	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
6411	0	a	I just want to let you know you are a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiots working down there. I just uninstalled your game because you have Steam Log in / Whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ your company is called log in. Okay i want steam log in but not i still have to make a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ account with your company? whats the point of this. Uninstalled just based of this stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ hope youre proud of your engineering and your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game looks like wow and gta 3 had a baby and it touched your hands and you had your head up your â¥â¥â¥ and were trying to dig it out what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this.
3917	0	a	The game itself is alright, the customization is great. Everything else sucks..to simply to put it.  Terrible community but an even worse support. They spend more time on trying to make a fast buck over helping players who were falsely banned. Whether you pay or not you're on their ignore list. If you try posting on the G1 forums they'll lock the thread and tell you to submit a support ticket, and if you submit a ticket, you'll get an automated-response that doesn't help you at all. The matchmaking is unbalanced, 9/10 times I get opposition that suck so bad they accuse me of hacking, apparently that isn't better than you will call you a hacker. There's a handful of exploits that people take advantage of. People will grief you constantly. There's only 4 maps total, 2 of them are pretty much just deathmatches. It's not pay2win but it the weapons are significantly better so in the right hands they can make a person unstoppable. There's a variety of missions but more or less repetitive. Enforcers get stun guns which can become very annoying very quickly, marketplace items are beyond overpriced. If you have no friends to play with in this game, it can really disappoint. Every so often you'll also come across hackers.  OVERALL  Game: 7/10 Community: 4/10 Support: 0/10  Total: 11/30  In other words, don't waste your time on a game that won't waste its time on you.
9677	0	a	Just terrrible. No real action what so ever, Nothing FUN to do at all, Its just another borring â¥â¥â¥ RTS like game. Very very very very very disapointed in it.
2702	1	a	Like Grand Theft Auto, but like Team Fortress at the same time!
1607	1	a	very fun game. so much to do. never got bored playing this!
830	1	a	Anyone else remember the time when you could put images on certain billboards? Yeah, Hentai, HENTAI EVERYWHERE!
8824	0	a	This game is not fun. The customization is amazing, but that is the only good quality about this game. The driving is the worst I've ever seen, the combat is ridiculously annoying, and the overall feel of the game is crap. It's fun to force loser pedestrians to give you their money, but the animation is always the same, and it gets old fast.  While you are mugging the 30th half naked white girl, you will pray for a idiot to run her over in a car.   I give it a 10/10 'cause I'm an idiot.
7056	0	a	You will encounter pro players if you are new in game, those players have plenty of premium and P2W weapons you dont stand a chance and thats why this game is dying all new players, are rage quitting because of that, the devs dont care about it because all the Golds are paying in $ Gold/premium hackers are not getting banned, they get supported by game masters.  roughly 54% of the players are hackers, 30% are Pro players and clans and all the rest are randoms and noobs.   gold players play on silver servers to pwn the regular players, the silvers are mad and play on bronze servers because they are tired of getting owned by golds and the bronze players and trainee players are getting pwnd by both and thats why they are leaving this unfair game, you shoud NOT download this game until they fix it or you will have a very frustrating/painful and hard start into this game, which means you are forced to go this way because they will NEVER fix this issue.
1616	1	a	The âJust 5 More Minutesâ Award  Fits Perfect for this ha
9595	1	a	I put in over 100000 Hr and i can say that this game is so MLG PRofesicanl Dwat I Waidsted Awl Myw Money. Its so good that i can say i didnt want to kill my self 30 times in a day when forced to pay this for loosing a bet. Also the admins or so amazing! they like are so mature! They listen to you and make sure all your errors are fixed. Exept all thos times people asked admins for help when they where getting harrased and the admins then harrased them...... So now i will show you how a average joe act on this game..  **** YOU THIS GAME IS GAY **** **** **** *** **** MY MOM JUST TAUGHT ME CUSS WORDS YOU ******* **** *** *** *** *** **   So people are rely friendly and help each other out all the time. This rely is the MMO experience you deserv right?  WRONG    Fallen earth takes the regular consept and makes it better! Example: Long Crafting times Horrible Respawns Ugly World Horrible Quest lines AND OF COURSE! THE BEST PAY TO WIN MOTTO! Erm... I mean ITS THE BEST! 69/420 MLG approved

9098	1	a	WHY ARE U READING THIS GET THE GAME ALREADY ITS FUN
9559	0	a	&lt;---(Fallen Earth)- I played this before it came to steam and quit because it sucked balls. The biggest problem was the abysmal map system combined with lack of direction. I thought that would be fixed since it came to steam. I just tried it and its exactly the same stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. There is no excuse for such dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the year 2012. Quit making games that make human beings look like they haven't evolved passed the Atari and Donkey Kong. This is a really crappy game. It feels generic as fk and is a total waste of anyones time. ANYONE.
10402	1	a	This game was fun but far too slow for me to really get into a lot I gave it a bit of time but the progression was just way too slow for me I felt as if I was playing WoW and the tutorial system was just as bad as WoW's when I tried this game though even with that all being said the game looked great and it showed a lot of promise.   While this type of game isnt for some people myself included I would still recommend it just for the fact that the game itself doesnt feel lieks ome kind of horrible ten minute made on a low budget game. The quality of this game is amazing and the simple fact that its free makes it all that much better I don't understand why so many people have a mixed view of this game but I am sure its in part to the fact that the community wasnt very nice to new players.
2637	1	a	One of my all-time favorite games on Steam. This game has insane customization and lots of replay value.
5910	0	a	Waste Of Time... -Informed Gamer
7038	0	a	Hello Guys, I've played this game for years starting in 2010 with some friends and I have played around 2000+ hrs on my account and 60 something hours via steam, But the reason I'm writing this review is to give advice to the next Innocent person walking into this â¥â¥â¥â¥ hole of game. Firstly the game is a love hate relationship you either like it or hate it not to mention also customization is brilliant but here comes the negative aspects.  Apb is a free to play mmo cops and robbers themed game, With free to plays you expect microtransactions well there is but the problem is they milk people for money, without considering what people actually want. For example people want the engine update or fix's for annoying bugs, but instead of good updates which make people more happy they slap a armas gun on the market place claiming it to be something magnificent, but it is only a reskin of another weapon in game.   Another reason why this game is bad is because of it's own community, the people in the community are absolutely cancerous and only strive to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off or make your day worse, Not saying everyone is cancerous because I've have spoke to quite a few nice people it's just the majority. Not to mention there are quite a few unbalanced weapons, like before I used to think 'Well that guy is Just better than me' Which in most cases it was; but if you put a unbalanced weapon in the hands of a good player or even a bad one they can â¥â¥â¥â¥ your entire match up.   After all of that Negative â¥â¥â¥â¥, I'll come down to saying this I'm giving a Warning to all players or people thinking of Playing this game. This game can cause you stress like nothing else and if you have anything like epilepsy or some sort PTSD stay away because it will cause you so much stress and make you soo â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you're either going to have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing seizure or just freak the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. Last thing I will say just to give you another reason to not play is gamersfirst make tons of promises which never happen.  Out of 1-10 It's a 4/10  Thus that makes the end of my Extremely Negative review and if any of you are interested I'm selling 4 of legendarys on Jericho (NA) add Ryoukomatoii and PM me or leave a message in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ review. Legendaries, Grenade launcher which shoots Concs, Nano, Ntec 7 Ursus and Hitchhiker I believe. I'll take real money these Will be going at a cheap price
6430	0	a	The game used to be good but now its another pay to win game.
10677	1	a	The game is so fast paced. If you get a kill it is SO much better than any other FPS because it its so hard to kill someone. The best game mode in my opinion is CTF.
845	1	a	Great game, so much fun fighting it out against the enforcers as a criminal. The customization in this game is amazing!
1382	1	a	YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!!!!  at first your going to think that the graphics are superbad,i dont care about graphics if its a good and fun game which this.I had this for about 1 month it is a super good game i am normally a envorcer.   BEST GAME I HAVE EVER GOT BESIDES GTA5!!!!!!!!!!!
3633	1	a	Great game but there's a lil delay when turning
5625	0	a	You need to like them on Facebook to play. I don't have a Facebook.
8329	0	a	TLDR:    Great ideas bought for naught after bankrupcy and then turned into pay2win hell with no actual game improvements since the take over.     Once upon a time, some developers made a game with huge potential and many nice concepts. Unfortunately they went bankrupt before the potential could be fulfilled. Luckily another compay bought the game and turned it into a more profitable one!.... By making it pay2win, thus securing the games future, at the low price of of the game turning from a fun yet incomplete game into a horrible pay2win game, which is also incomplete.  I did enjoy myself for a while, but as soon as it dawned on me that no amount of grinding would put me on par with the pay2win crowd, I lost interest and moved on.
6477	0	a	lags like a dogs â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you dont have a pre good pc and is about as fun as watching dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ dry to play 4/10
2281	1	a	Its ok.
7881	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
8438	0	a	Just a load of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
5742	0	a	In my 4 hours that i have played this, i have experienced hell. the hud is barely managable, im barely able to understand whats going on around me. ive read almost 3 guides on this game. all wasted time. when i got into my first mission we had already lost. i made it to the objective to be shot down and killed in a single bullet. second mission, same thing. third, fourth i was catching on, all the players i were playing against had spend money on this game. i dont spend money on free to play games, and when i do its when i really enjoy it and want to support the game. (ie rift, neverwinter, and team fortress 2). i am not going to sit back and be completely destroyed by people who have wasted money on a concept that is beyond convulted and overdone. not to mention, all the servers on here are over flooded with idiots and racist â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. so, 2/10. not even that. -10/10.
1821	1	a	A nice F2P and MMOTPS to play, check it out.
7667	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
3561	1	a	is nice
9139	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I tried to do a mission and it said to make bullets i had the materials but I couldnt craft it.It turns out you have to find teh blue print this quest is one the of the beggining ones.
8073	0	a	I don't like writing bad reveiws. I am saying a no on my recommendation,(The little hand thingy),but I am saying yes at the same time. It is a very good idea of a game. It was developed well,the idea is good,and they came through with the idea. But the bad part is that it is a PAY TO WIN. I mean,come on. You have more gun verieties than GTA(From what I've seen,but you can buy them with real money,or rent them. Really I would only spend money on this game if I just had EXTRA money on my account that I have no other use for. To recap,the game itself was good,but any customisation that you actually want to look good (That's not basic) you have to invest money into. I would highly recomend this game if they change their Pay To Win ways.
5644	0	a	Man reminds me of the old days when you had to blow the cassette to play the game. Instead if charges you money and it won't work. 11/10 too much toxicity.
3724	1	a	I really like the game. It might look like its hard to get into but with the help of some friends you can get better really quickly.
8621	0	a	What is wrong with this game ? They let me make an account and after that they told me I'm too young. When I finally entered the game I realise how garbage is it.
3498	1	a	Great game!
1103	1	a	is good i met 2pac he wasnt very nice tho
4057	0	a	This game is broken... I downloaded the game off the official website and it would not let me launch it up. So i deleted the files and downloaded it off steam and yet again would not let me play. So i tryed to delete it again and it would not let me, even now as i write this review it says im playing APB, but i'm not. I dont know if this a common problem but personaly i am pretty disapointed.
2961	1	a	A Good fun game , It's much better with friends, The only thing i can complain about is the fact that you can only buy weapons that run out after 10 days, Or you can pay real money or farm for 1-2 months to earn one, If you go to buy one with money the cheapest for a character is 28 euro. (Perm for that char)
3495	1	a	update: the game is dead. now they're just milking the remaining players as much as they can. still... APB for life.
8872	1	a	Over all a pretty good game , but FE has it's share of issues as I'll discuss below.    Story:   There isn't one. There is a bare bones backstory to the different factions, what they're about, and what they offer....but that's about it. There's also general story lines in each settlement along with a ton of sidequests, but they do little to establish any kind of narrative.    Gameplay:   FE works like a 3rd person shooter combined with WoW. You have to aim your own weapons (more on this in the PVP section) and there are a number of abilities you can activate during combat to give yourself an edge. This part of the game is done pretty well, combat is intuitive and if you pay attention to the tutorial, fairly easy to pick up.   The crafting system in this game is fantastic, almost every material needed to craft everything you could ever want can be salvaged from the world, harvested at player created farms, collected by player made harvesters in PVP zones, or purchaced off the Auction House.     Graphics:   This wasn't that big of a deal to me since I don't get hung up on graphics much, but this game was developed in 2009 and the graphics look pretty dated.     Player population:   I don't get alot of the complaints about this as at no point were any of the sector hubs empty. As a crafter I had no trouble making money off the Auction House as there were plenty of buyers for most of my products (once I figured out how to price them properly). You probably won't be tripping over other players when you're out in the middle of nowhere on missions, but is that a bad thing?    F2p or pay to win?   FE is good about this aspect as well. There is a cash shop where you can buy boosts to things like experience and faction point award rates; but there's no explicit thing you can buy in the cash store that will give you any advantage against an equally skilled and leveled player whom has never bought anything from the cash shop. The items you pay real money for are largely cosmetic or purely for convinence.     PVP:   This is by far the most mixed aspect of Fallen Earth. FE does reward pvp kills against different factions with a pvp currency, but in a move I haven't seen in any other MMO (except EVE), FE adds a reason to fight in PVP zones other than pvp currency, Harvesters. Harvesters are player created structures that generate crafting resources that hard to impossible to find outside PVP zones, and as you can guess can only be placed in PVP zones. When all goes well PVP is fun &amp; rewarding, regardless if your faction holds the conflict town at the end of the day.  So what's wrong you ask? First off you're not likely to get a real taste of PVP untill you're close to level cap, granted if you hang around the level 20-45 conflict towns you might bump into an enemy faction; but if you do it's likely to be a clan blob of 5-10 people leveling their alts &amp; steamrolling anyone in their path. The reason the lower level zones are so empty? The level debuff, which cripples anyone above a given conflict town's level range. The idea isn't a bad one: to keep tweaked out lvl 55s from curb stomping fledgling pvp players. But instead of bringing them on the level of people supposed to be in that zone it effectively renders the higher level player helpless; as a result nobody goes near conflict zones if there's even a chance they'll get hit with the level debuff.  But the absolute worst part is the proliferation of hackers (aimbotters and the like) in pvp. G1 does a pretty inconsistent job of keeping hackers in check; every once in a while they do a purge of hackers and PVP becomes fun again, but they always seem to come back. 90% percent of the challenge in pvp is consistently hitting your opponent, preferably with headshots which do considerably more damage, getting good at hitting and avoiding being hit is the core of PVP. So you can see how the fun gets quickly sucked out of this critical part of the game when you have ENTIRE CLANS able to sweep whole PVP zones simply by activating a 3rd party hack and racking up 100% accuracy while their opponents have no recourse what so ever. The fact G1 has been unable or unwilling to find a long term solution to this problem is by far FE's biggest problem.    Summary:   Fallen Earth is f2p game that isn't pay to win; that alone makes it worth a try. But digging deeper this game has plenty to offer in terms of PVE, crafting, and (if the hacker population is culled at the time) end game PVP. It's really up to what you value in an MMO if FE is worth your time; it certianly is for me despite it's faults.
7491	0	a	my game simply just wont load up :/
10748	1	a	Should you play this game? Yes. Think TF2 quality but faster. EPICSAUCE!!!!!
3248	1	a	This game rocks. There isn't a better free play game out there
7771	0	a	Pros:  - Fun Gunplay (to a certain extent)  - Extremely indepth customization.  Cons:  - Balancing issues (Certain guns can 1/2 shot lower level vehicles.)  - Terrible Matchmaking system. (Someone with &lt;1 hour of gameplay can get matched with someone of &gt;3000 hours.)  - Server Issues  
3528	1	a	it is a fun third person but one problem it crash A LOT i can barly play it but it is the first week on steam so....
2232	1	a	Always come back to this game, it's just different to everything else that it's compelling honestly. It's not very rewarding or welcoming for newer players, and basically has a skill 'cliff' once you start playing with better people. It's an amazing game once you get into it. Please don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing listen to the 'p2w' â¥â¥â¥â¥ that some people still believe, the N-Tec, Joker Carbine, PMG, and HVR are the best guns, which can all be bought very quickly as you hop into the game for the first time. A lot of the guns you don't know are usually just reskins of the HVR or N-Tec you get through loyalty rewards, purchased on the store, or from endgame contacts. Some missions are flawed, like VIP missions and a few unfair locations for them. All guns are usable at certain distances, and you change a lot. It's nice. Trust me son.
3182	1	a	Love this game. PLayed it for years.
123	1	a	Fun, And the custom designs of clothes and cars, never end. better playing in groups of friends
258	1	a	good game but the city is to small 
780	1	a	i like the game its awesome
8656	0	a	Imagine scrubbing your â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the new and improved 2016 edition of SHAM WOW! Its really painful because its actually a brick inside of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ towel so have fun!
2276	1	a	Its a fun time kill, some aspects are a little clunky but not hard to overlook. Customization is fun
6170	0	a	JUST NO. Riddled with microtransaction. SUCKS BALLS. The pictures here are misleading. Horrible UI. JUST NO.
8864	0	a	I played this game early on, ran a very popular clan, and loved PVP. Gamersfirst destroyed Fallenearth. In 3 years, they have made 4 new weapons. No new levels, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ exspansion areas. This was one of the best games I ever played, but G1, destroyed the whole game. Don't let my hours through steam fool you, I played way before steam launch. The PvP used the be the best I could find anywhere, but now it is so plagued with aim botters, and all the PvP builds are cookie cutter builds. I made a build from my own preference, a low heals high damage fighter, and it worked, so what happens, they nerfed it till I couldn't use it anymore. Building a character for PvP through your rp mindset doesn't work. The PvP is down to a variety of six weapons, and four reskinned sets of armor. The developers of this game, take all the money from it, and dump it into other games. It was one of the best MMOs I ever played, and it will not be forgotten, but as it stands I will never play again .
895	1	a	I do enjoy this game. Many people comment upon the fact that the game was spoiled. I agree with this statement to an extent. For the first couple of week playing the game, It's extremely fun, But after a while it become repetitive and boring, but this is after a long time.   Pay To Win:  This game as covered in pay to win items, but this is understandable since it is a f2p game. Anything that you can buy with money, you can earn legit through hard work in-game. So its just really booster packs. The only exceptions to this is apparel and vehicles. Some of the best weapons in the game you can simply buy on the in-game marketplace with in-game money.   Team Balancing:  Team balancing is horrendous. I have had experiences of being on a team with bronze threats (2nd lowest threat level, I'm a silver), And been against a team of gold threats. The reason this occurs is due to the fact that the punishment for gold threats playing on a silver threat server is next to nothing. This is an easy way for gold threats to play, because they are against silvers and bronzes. And they are not getting punished for doing so. Due to this, The gold threat servers are gathering dust.   Enforcers VS Criminal:    Enforcers have a MASSIVE advantage over Criminals, E.G.:   Having the ability to arrest us, and then kill us (because the penalty for doing so is next to non-existent)   Having all of the apb veterans on their side, This is a massive issue.    Repetitive:  Apb has got repetitive, I mean like.. Stressfully repetitive. Players are forced to grind for weeks, playing every single day of the week to be able to catch up to the opposite teams. They are forced to do the same thing over and over and over again. This is one of the main reasons I don't really play this game anymore.    Conclusion:  In conclusion, despite what I have said, I would recommend this game to a very specific audience. That audience would be:   Willing to spend quite allot of money on a game.   Willing to grind for weeks on end   Willing to do the same thing over and over again   Willing to enjoy something like this   Willing to put up with the unfair team balancing   -TheKillerToaster
4296	0	a	It doesn't work after I press 'Start' on the launcher,
230	1	a	this game is good get it now 
7339	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥       jk i've never played it i just have it xD
10556	1	a	This game was and still is the game that saved pc gaming for me. I love this game (even when I played on a toaster) so much and the newest update changed the game in a way that I could reimagine the whole game. I recommend this game if you want to have a fast paced game and countless hours of highspeed battles travelling in ridicoulus speeds.
5818	0	a	it was a good game, but was
7807	0	a	Game has micro transactions. I get thats its free, but microtransactions are the only way to play the game? Really? 
4344	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
7730	0	a	NEVER PLAY THIS GAME. So laggy at the sight of another player, you just stop moving. Not even fun as a joke. I have never played a game that was so badly made, problems installing and playing. It also uses punk buster, the worst piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ software there ever was.
962	1	a	hOW DO I GET IT TO START?!?!?
9496	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game don't try to play it its like combat ars â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ omg !
203	1	a	one of the worst games I've ever played. there is nothing to do. you can't do anything in it. there's tdm and missions and you can wear clothes but if you are a girl you cannot wear certain pants.
5131	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks â¥â¥â¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.
3405	1	a	Well, the balance system is a do-it-even-exist but it has the most advanced character custumization system ive seen and the environment in missions is awesome so its worth testing
10700	1	a	Jump off a hill. Hit skiis. Go fast. Grab the flag. Run like hell. Shazbot. Oh, and there's some shooting too. Why are you still reading this, by the way?
8962	1	a	I played this game on and off for the last few years. Sure its pretty dated but it holds together well.   It's really in its on niche at times, but it's still great.   It's not exactly a causal game or regular player game. It just depends on what you want to do, because the world and its missions are are pretty open.   It's worth trying at least once.      
2231	1	a	I hear they are doing an engine overhaul!!!!???
3335	1	a	10/10 would uninstall again
10430	0	a	Wasting time simulator ;D

9101	0	a	Controls weren't fluid at all and felt akward, Crafting system wasn't player friendly, and Nothing was very clear on what the goal was.
7069	0	a	wtf is this?
3754	0	a	Review Update: The link that showed proof to the corrupt devs has been removed by the original poster, It had nothing to do with protecting the corrupt devs.  TL;DR Version at bottom
1729	1	a	I very much recommend this game to anyone really, it's a very fun game indeed and has a excellent player-base in my opinion. There may be a few bugs and lag issues but the fun content in the game makes up for al that. 5/5 stars!
2833	1	a	Cool, Game, Very GTA but with mates.
7740	0	a	This game isn't really new-user friendly. It handles much like GTA, but guns are unlocked based on your level, and you have to kill people do gain levels. They basically start you out with a stick and everyone else has rocket launchers. It's more fun to play with a friend, especially if you're just starting. Friends are more likely to put up with your learning curve than the community would.
2706	1	a	Its like cookies, sweet and sometimes bitter
9255	0	a	The game looks pretty fun to be honest, but i don't think i'll ever play it.   too many problems preventing me from even getting into the game.  -Official site nearly always down, you have to wait a long time on high speed internet for them to send you a verification link after making an account -if you manage to even log in, the faulty launcher gets stuck in an infinite loop, constantly deleting and redownloading the same files.  take a look at the issues the playerbase has with getting access to this game, and save yourself some time.
3921	0	a	Horrible community always getting abused for winning and sometimes losing.  p.s Rip my feelings
2349	1	a	just making this to annoy my friends
6675	0	a	APB... APB its, its amazeing! The customization, The Detail. It had me playing it for hours. To the point where I wouldnt even know the sun has passed and the day was over. Though the community can be harsh. Thats not so bad. All the guns are ballenced, So i thought.  All the guns you get (In-Game with out paying) are ballenced, I am even talking about you annoying OSMAW, You are balenced as well. The thing is, Some guns in the 'ARMAS Market' Are just plain, stupid. I mean like the universal ATAC or the NANOS. Those wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt mixed in with the commonly known 'De-Threaters'. People who lose matches (So they may join bronze servers, Though they may be a gold threat rank) often ruin the fun time, Win or loss, i may be haveing with my friends. It is just a major killjoy when a bronze comes in with a ATAC and NANO, His skills are just way beyond me or my friends. As they reck havoc on all the missions, till they hit gold. Just to dethreat back to bronze, to repeat the process.  Another problem is the rerolls, People who make new accounts so they wont have to 'De-Threat'. Rerolls are quite common. As the fact i am a R212 and a R009 will join and kick me and my teams butt... Alone. With no help. Not saying they hack, I know some ppl have VERY Good skills on games. It just makes it hard for me to return to such a beuitifull game. This legit  'One of a kind'  game. It saddens me about all the problem this game has.   Lastly my ending result for this game. Sadly would be to  AVOID IT . It is very fun, Very Addicting, Very... Frusterating, Screen punching frusterating. Unless you are a natural born shooter. Evrey one I have talked to agree, that g1 (The Game owners) only have this game running because it is a 'Legit' Money farm for them, All they do is care for the money. I mean look up the prices for your self. All and All this game would be a five of ten for me.  Thank you for reading this review on this wonderfull game. 
8258	0	a	if you play have fun going to lag hell , dont recommend
10557	1	a	.
9461	1	a	I was almost addicted to this game! There is such a vast world! I love it!
1961	1	a	I like this game alot.
6086	0	a	Apb is a good game and fun I put more that 70$ on the game But today apb gave me account block or in other words, banned I never done cheats on the game  I never scam or anything els This week i got 4 permanent guns from joker boxes and now every thing that i put on the game is in the creators money and more that 600 hours  Was nice to play apb alot but im rly  Disappointed from the game...
3850	0	a	I have really played this game a bunch. Back when it was pay2play.  In that state though the game was alot better. Let me just state it in pro's and cons:  Pro's: + Fun to play together and in clans + RP Possibility + Big map Cons: - Lag, very unstable  - Hackers, oh god the hackers, not normal. Unplayable since the game has been F2P  - Micro transactions are terrible.. - Player base is low..  Play it.. Dont play it. Whatever you decide.  I wouldnt, not worth it.  R.I.P  APB Reloaded.
7763	0	a	I have issues, the voices in my head don't like this game.
8660	0	a	Didn't play for two minutes before I was shot and killed by my own team for doing a mission objective. Tried a few more times and same thing. What a great way to start a game,being tk'd and cursed out. This was on the American server so it could be different on European/Asian servers. Community ruined it as constant barrage of insults filling the message box for the most inane things(not even related to my own noobiness). It was like a bunch of junior highers hitting puberty at the same time and not knowing what to do with all the new hormones invading their system. Instead of saying 'hey we don't raid this because it gives us a serious disadvantage or hold out here' you get called 'stupid *&amp;^%()$ trainee' for doing what the game instructs. Don't even want to know if there is a good game underneath it all. Eve online's community is more forgiving.  Edit:The concept and gameplay are quite solid but the lag is terrible. I know it's not just on my end due to user reviews along with people screaming in unison about it while playing. I just can't give it a thumbs up as of yet.
1581	1	a	GREAT NOT PAY TO WIN YOU CAN BUY GREAT GUNZ INGAME 100% worth brathaz TRUST ME WHEN I FIRST PLAYED THIS I SAID OH â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS PAY TO WIN â¥â¥â¥â¥ BUT I GOT IN TO IT I HAVE EVERY THING AND NEVER PUT ANY REAL MONEY IN TO THIS GAME 
1927	1	a	The games lost its charm, but I still play it! why do i love this game so much?!
3247	1	a	...
7873	0	a	Go and â¥â¥â¥â¥ your self with the nvidia phisyx
9919	0	a	It has bugs, it wont let me open the options menu and it freezes everytime i use the scroll to zoom in.
9583	1	a	My face hurts ;_; 10.9/10
8789	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
3444	1	a	  -Really fun gameplay -Graphics are okay -2 Teams -Open World Multiplayer!
5569	0	a	All these 19 hrs that you see here were all updates for me....i didn't even get to play the game...our internet is not that bad to download all the files within around maybe 2 hrs at the most..like literally the update speed was 10 kb/s
10478	1	a	Yeah its pretty cool, don't play it much now.
6882	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
4808	0	a	It left something running in the background of my computer for 244.66 hours. I played for 20 minutes. 
848	1	a	Ignore all the people that say bad devs, it's a half truth. It has devs, and some updates, but it has very FEW devs. They are in Dev hell, play and support, its in a hole.   Play atleast, make friends, they will keep you playing. You don't have to spend money, atleast give them numbers so they can get support another way. This game can easily become number one.
6026	0	a	Words cnat even describe how pay to win this is, but I can try.  First off it is important to note that the 'tutorial' the game gives you is little mpore than some stuff that you need to do, but it doesnt really say how and while you do it, your not in a seperate part of the game like most mmo's, no you are in the game, with no clue what to do.   Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.  Honestly, when i got this game, i saw the bad reviews and thought 'Whatver, this game looks awesoeme!', and even though i started with no expectations, somehow, this bundle of steaming horse crap has gone below my lowest expectations. Do not play this game, please, just trust me.  Overall -10/10
8125	0	a	This game sucks
5311	0	a	Its lazy, boring, driving controls are just... no
7894	0	a	It was once a good game, now broken by bad devolopers, bad matchmaking, and greedy developers.
82	1	a	i love this game :D 
3333	1	a	Fix your game, i am stuck on the character menu.
3789	0	a	You don't want to play this game. I had typed out a long review, but Steam decided to discard it, so let me summarize:  Bad matchmaker. Low level players instantly against high level ones, over and over again, and level makes a difference in this game, both in skill and gear. Buggy gameplay, with bad shooting mechanics based around spread AND recoil, with few guns being able to perform more than one singular task. Horrible players who alternate between hacking, griefing, and acting like total tools to the rest of the community. And a game company managing it who doesn't know what the word manage means. Literally has let the game get worse and lag more and more over the past year and a half. If you must play this game, do not pay for anything, there is no reason to, and it's just as likely the game will die in the next year, flushing your money down the drain.
4486	0	a	the 1st prob is too much cheaters/hackers in the game! (that's the fact!) the 2nd prob is the shop's price is too much expensive like 50-60â¬ for 1 weapon or half price for haircut... and maybe idk some of the players are rich who knows? many of the players are full stuff with gold gear cars weapons... and the weapons are too much CHEAT the gold ones send u 10 bullets in 1sec (example) and the standard white gun in game is like you have a shotgun 80% damage in 1 shot and when u shot (all ammo off) those players under 5m they just kill you with handgun (gold weapon) like 2 shots without accuracy and keep running... the 3rd prob is technical i mean the game is unstable 'cause i'm playing on pc gamer and using fiber but have some trouble with the game stability or something... (i mean it's not perfect)  PS: i played over 300H so it's not just a beginners reaction!
3101	1	a	Best shooter i have ever played
8679	0	a	this game. issue after issue. so, first off. after opening it the 2nd time. the launcher was scanning. infinitely. for god knows what. after disabling IPv6 protocol, it worked. but when i tried to launch game. it did absolutely nothing. well, it opened chrome tab, 'like us on facebook to get 1 day free premium' (big whoop one god damn day..) after pressing launch AGAIN. it opened a splash screen. then opened another one. after leaving it like this for couple mins. nothing. so far, from my experience. this game. not worth 1 hr of downloading. (5GB from steam, then came with 500MB update from launcher, which only downloaded at 25-50% of my max download limit..)  (as i havent been able to play this game yet. dont take in consideration of my 'do you recomend this game' as u may not experience this issues like i have.)
2072	1	a	Make no mistake, this is not GTA. It is it's own thing. And it's a big give and take. The big attraction is the customization for characters and cars. It's VERY involved, and I love it. The gun play is passable, not great, but it has it's moments. Driving is terrible, it feels just totally wrong. The game modes are a lot of fun, with one exception. You can only get so much fun out of this game without friends to play with.
6690	0	a	The free version is very hard to play. You are dead, dead, dead and dead. Running through the city with simple SMG, then someone with RPG blast you from behind. And again and again.
6063	0	a	Apb is a good game and fun I put more that 70$ on the game But today apb gave me account block or in other words, banned I never done cheats on the game  I never scam or anything els This week i got 4 permanent guns from joker boxes and now every thing that i put on the game is in the creators money and more that 600 hours  Was nice to play apb alot but im rly  Disappointed from the game...
1865	1	a	Multiplayer Cops and Robbers styled game.  Whether you be a Enforcer of the City Security Act or a Criminal out causing havok, this game is quite good if you're into Team Deathmatch and 'Capture the Flag' style games.   You have the ability to customize your character and your vehicle which can drive around one of the many districts available with players always on. From there you can accept missions and be placed against other players or even go solo.  The game is different from most team servers, where games set you up with people you don't know, randomly, etc. APB is different, it encourages you to make a team even providing in-game voice chat.  The only cons about the game I have is it quite laggy at times (at least for me), due to the fact the servers are not Austrlian based. The lag is hardly noticable unless you're in a vehicle due to the poor response times it has. Another thing is the hackers which are on the game and you have to purchase premium which gets you points quicker.
4442	0	a	I absolutely do not recomend this game to ANYONE. This idea that criminals are taking over the city with the police in dissaray, but a new act is passed which allows a militia police force of sorts can fight the criminals is exciting. I picked this game up on the idea of 'Oh why not, it is free' only to be greeted by a game that took an eternity to download. I had to download this download that, do this third party application, taking me an hour to finish! Could you do it through steam instead!? I then said 'After all of this the game better not suck' and oh boy.... I will start with the positives. A HUGE customization system that i have never seen before, being able to modify character height, muscularity, you name it, it is there. It doesnt end there because you can customize your clothing as well with decals (I made the LVMPD uniform dont judge) You can customize your car and it is the most fun i have had in this game. Now the negatives.....where to start. When i first did a mission, I was happy as the game was kind enough to put me with decent people. After that, I was thrown into games with people who had better gear than i did, had more skill than me, and used every dirty trick in the book against me, a guy who just started the game! The matchmaking is awful! You will be cursing and raging at how much you die because the game puts you with better equiped and skilled people. On to the combat system. It is awful, just awful. Please tell me how a guy with an smg can get the same accuracy on the move as a guy aiming with an assault rifle? You will constantly be saying, 'How did he not die?!' or 'How the hell did I die!?' There is no headshots in the game because you know, shooting someone in the foot is the same as shooting them in the head right? There are no balanced hitboxes. you can make your character as small as you wish but you will have the same hitboxes as a tall person. WTF!? Veteran players abuse this 'ghost shotting' and you will be left scratching your head how you died. Also, the missions are extremely limited to a few modes. King of the hill, conquest, team king of the hill, car capture the flag (hotwire), and capture the flag. The mission descriptions themselves are also rediculous and are real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reasons to send the SWAT team, FBI tactical teams, ATF tactical teams for a pile of pirated video games?! Does it seriously take an entire Special Weapons and Tactics Team to raid a place for a couple boxes of pirated video games? Apparently it does because the criminals decide to defend a couple hundred dollars of damn pirated games. What i'm trying to say is that some situations you are put into, make no logical sense at all. Since this game is F2P, there are microtransactions, you should expect that. But here is the problem, instead of fixing a broken combat system and a multitude of latency problems and crap driving, they are adding new unbalanced guns to the F2P gun store. Another thing i will add, the community here is almost entirely unfriendly to ANYONE. In missions, instead of coordinating with team mates, they stay quiet just going in random directions and getting shot. At the end, they blame their team for being crap when they didnt do anything to coordinate. I was teamkilled by OTHER POLICE FORCES in a mission repeatedly. They will then go to insult you in the chat as well because you trying to coordinate in the game is a crime to these guys. These â¥â¥â¥â¥ers think that this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Esports tournament and if they lose 1 match, they lose a chance at a million dollars. Playing solo like I did is TERRIBLE, dont do it because you cant rely on your team for anything, bring 3-4 friends with you. I could forgive a crappy combat system if the community is somewhat bearable but here, nearly everyone is an â¥â¥â¥ or a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are only a few decent players and the game is fun when you get into games with them. However, getting into these games is super rare. I had a round with a really good guy that was one of the quiet ones but then opened up a little bit as me and him did missions a bit more. We were in a 2v2 and all parties were trying and it got so close, we almost won, and that was fun! What else? Oh there is a whole lot of hackers and they either aimbot or are the one shot kill types with AK 47s. To sum this all up, the community is crap, the combat system is broken, there are tons of bugs and glitches, the devs dont listen to other players on the forums and defend hackers, they dont fix the game, and it all boils down to it being a rage inducing Free to play MMO. Don't even waste your time.    Update at 2/21/2015: tried to play this game again after an update. Had a couple of good games, because i was lucky. Community is still a steaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Teamkilled by police forces.....again....called a 'dumbass' for not remembering every damn corner of the map. I hope this same community doesnt infest the other police sims out there. seriously most of the community sucks. I cannot seem to have fun in this game whatsoever but by pure chance. Im going to enjoy uninstalling this POS from my hard drive.
1521	1	a	First impression of the game was great. However, as I progressed, and looked around, did research... I discovered that the game is indeed pay to win, with an over priced cash shop to boot.  That aside, Strong weapons don't give you skill. You can outplay a cash weapon, but God help you if you have an aimbotter with one. Yes, this game is full of hackers. Hell, today I was up against someone named 'NxT' Who has horrible, horrible aim just two days ago. Now suddenly, they have near perfect aim, no matter where you go, where you juke, where you jump, it hits. This isn't a rare case, a lot of people hack, and the community denies it, along with denying claims of pay to win. Side note, yesterday I saw someone running on foot, faster than any car in the game. Aimbot: Check. Speed hacks: Check.  NOW. If you can put those aside, it's actually an extremely fun game, it's fun to jsut â¥â¥â¥â¥ around, make decals to sell, cruise around and 'accidentally' hit someone that's clearly in a mission, ruining what he's doing. If you're the type to be able to find fun as a free player that can enjoy his time, working around hackers and going on a grind for other weapons, then I will recommend this game.  If you're the type to really care about a fair fight (We'll get to Fair Fight after this bit) then I cannot recommend this game. You will find a lot of hackers and cashers that think they're super cool to have stats that you can only get by paying $40 bucks for one weapon.  Onto Fair Fight, APB's pride and joy of an anti cheat system. Yeah, it's complete trash. They have an over priced cash shop, and don't spring for real anti cheating. I'm being completely honest when I say that 1 out of 10 hackers are banned, and the one ban is still very rare.  TLDR? Recommended if you're not a tryhard.  I myself enjoy the game, being a free player that plans to not spend a dime on the game, so this review ends in recommended simply due to my own enjoyment.
6515	0	a	Nah Even if you have 8gb ram it still says not enough ram
5365	0	a	Just get any Saints row or GTA game, its better then APB in everyway, don't get me started on the hit detection.
9289	0	a	Pros: The idea seemed cool. Poorly executed though.  Cons:  Clunky Controls, C**p gameplay, Pay 2 Win, 12 year old staff members with the ability to Powerflex when they choose to, and the list goes on.  Took me a few hours to download it, took me 5 minutes for Eric Cartman the moderator to find me and start talking smack and ban me because I refused to respect his authority despite him just being a massive do**he nozzle towards new players. Wasted so much bandwidth trying to play this s**t game. Would not recommend even p**sing in this games direction.
3670	1	a	i seriously never understood what i was doing in this game, but it's fun.
281	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
1922	1	a	Other than the fact that Gold Rated Districts and Players are either hackers or gods, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome game with intense ammounts of creative freedom, also get ready for the pervs, there are lots.
8952	0	a	After playing for a little bit and ended up realising that this game just isn't fun. They give us an open world that is just completely empty, the hit boxes are horrid, and the fact that in order to PvP you have to accept duals is kinda stupid for a gaint game such as this. This game just feels like World of Warcraft with a Nuclear Apocalypse skin on it. Someone's review said it was like fallout. That is completely wrong it only looks like Fallout:NV (Gaint, empty, and brown being the main color) I would not download this game as it is a complete waist of time and space on your hardrive. Also one other thing, everthing goes by levels, so instead of going around and being ableto take on things and people because they have a gun and you don't you take things on because one side is mega level 9000 (just an expression) and your not. Leaving this unbalanced and enemies just plain boring. Especaily since you start out with a gun that can kill things from lvl1-10. Its just plain boring.
6507	0	a	Just not my cup of tea.  I can see why players might like a game like this, however I despise multiplayer shooters of this nature. I was made curious by the apparent explorey open-world look of it but it's just a fancy-pants way of dressing up a series of competitive multiplayer maps.
2165	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!! :D)
2825	1	a	um yeah i think that you should make it a fun game to play and get it to be have fun playing
6665	0	a	took loads of space took forever to load and was terrible once loaded 0/100000000000
6800	0	a	Doesen't load the Game 
9996	1	a	This game... Well simply I picked it up on a whim and got addicted to the crafting system, the first crafting system to actually make sense. Besides that being a shooter mmo it is not like most mmo's where its press tab and sit back; no on the contrary you better aim your gun or weapon carefully.
6578	0	a	This game is unfinished and buggy. Only creating my character took me about hour and I had to do it 3 times. And then, after I joined server, game started to crash every time I tried to choose spawnpoint. I have to wait to next update and hope they will do something. They did. I finally succeed to start game without crashes, but there were so huge lags that I refused to continue playing. Oh my God! This can be so much good game! Character customizations, symbol and vehicle editors. I don't know much games able to rival! Just, please, DO SOMETHING WITH ALL THOSE BUGS!
6960	0	a	Crashed in the first five seconds. 10/10
10385	1	a	In first hour this game was worst for me, but after 1-2 hours i was addicted to it :D
541	1	a	help... i... cant.. stop....
10114	1	a	The best mission-threads of any MMO I've ever played. Post-Nuke Bliss! ...but eventually PVP is going to rear its head, so be forewarned, if that's not 'your cup of meat'. I give it 8 out of 10, and no one gets a 10
10424	1	a	Great game, crafters heaven, bit old looking but it is a bit old. There's plenty to do fun to make your character look like a bad@$$. The faction system feels so good and make you feel like you have control over what you do as you allign yourself with people of similar morals.The only big downfall to this game is the lack of player base and the small team working on it, if this game got more attention it would turn into something great. I really hope this game grows!
6401	0	a	Could be a lovely mixture of Saint Row The third with GTA (hope someone makes a better version)  Great cosept and a bit similar in how distany works, but in all Very awfull UI, not so fun driving, bad popups, more and more  postive things: - Alot of cars and guns - Alot of custom things you can add to cars and cloths  Bad things: - Most is 'locked' away behind pay bars something like nearly everything... basic guns and vehicles no... they mostly is pay for 1 free of everything else (primary, car etc) - nothing going for it in the beginning only when you have been able to unlock some its fun? - No balanced districts becomes a problem - UI sometimes can't explain whats importent and standard menu and all is messy and is not good at all (don't even tell new players where the car custominazion is or 'store' etc)
8533	0	a	A great game with amazing customization that is a way smoother, better GTA Online.  APB: Reloaded is a repetitive game that you never just kind of get bored of, since its never just killing each other, you will always be tasked to defend/attack/capture an objective. Every mission you play is different, each team will affect how the mission progresses, for example, if your team has anti vehicle weapons, and the enemy team has to deliver cars, you will have a way higher chance of winning that stage of the mission. Using the right type of guns in the right situation will greatly affect how the match progresses.  Missions with multiple players are always chaos, as players with rockets launchers and light-machine guns come after your â¥â¥â¥, other players out of your mission hurry to their mission, and on their way, crash to your car causing your car to flip and forcing you to continue on foot. Many things can affect your mission in a positive or  negative way. San Paro is absolute CHAOS.  Pros and Cons  Pros: - A great Grand Theft Auto like PVP game - Amazing customization (cars, players, clothes, guns, symbols) - A very unique type of game that you HAVEN'T seen before. - Many ways to play the game - Free to play - Very smooth gameplay - Doesn't get boring after thousands of hours of gameplay - Very fun to play with friends (not as fun alone..)  Cons: - Armas Marketplace (You can buy ingame stuff with real money,  prizes are ridiculously high and they should rather be unlockable through ingame progression)   (THESE ARE HUGE ISSUES WITH THE GAME) --&gt;&gt;&gt; Poorly optimized (even players with high end computers lag alot) --&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Servers lag often (only thing they seem to do is reset the servers which does nothing)   - Devs are really slow at fixing the game's problems - Hackers (they now get banned fast though) - Bad community (unfriendly) - NHVR sniper needs to be nerfed, ridiculously overpowered  ##################################################################  In the end, after 2,990 hours, was it worth it?  No. Servers at the moment are garbage, game servers lag almost daily (ddos or other excuse they say), and fps is garbage in the game always since they do not optimize it, and servers are always running on migitation (means more lags, less ddos)  Would not recommend this game as the core idea is good but the game itself is a HUGE disappointment. I've had to spend a ton of money to enjoy the game to the fullest. And to a degree, I regret it.
7726	0	a	I'm afraid that I found this game sparse on content, and without progression. You do not get to keep anything- only rent it for a time, and that means that in a few weeks, you are back where you started, regardless.
5344	0	a	This game is terrible and get worse by the day. After firing the dev team and promising to be better, Publisher GamerFirst took a few steps backwards. The servers promised never arrived. Server downtimes increased and all the way around, worst communit ever. Good luck and God have mercy on your sould you choose to play this game.
7931	0	a	pay 2 win, poor match making system, lags alot, bad shooting mechanics, time consuming for weapon/mods/vehicle that lasts days   the only + is the character creation system! the character customization is dope! the ability to create your own music tracks! the ability to create your own logos, the art customization is great! but it aint enough to save it
7547	0	a	Fun yet stupid game if your going to play this you either need a lot of money or you need to be able to withstand lots and lots of rage and stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking is broke as â¥â¥â¥â¥
5116	0	a	full of cheaters
4719	0	a	the game wont even start up for me what a waste of my life trying for 1 hour to get this work -1/10
2802	1	a	Simple Cops vs Robbers but highly addicting ! One of the Best F2P Games
9941	0	a	Boring and mediocre.

10811	1	a	Tribes is ascend is a slippery slope of back and forth with classes straight outta the fortress hood.    rekt/10
6857	0	a	i used to think this game was great, but i was extremely wrong  the community is terrible, if you lose or win you have a good chance to get either a generic 'gg' which isnt too bad, or you will get insulted. what makes this even worse is that there is no rule about being nice to other players at all  the matchmaking is even worse, any rank can visit any server even if the server is dedicated to a rank lower than them. this means that a silver rank can join a bronze rank server and absolutely destroy everyone  driving is sloppy because if you lag a lot you have a 100% chance to crash into a building and kill a few civillians  this is what really changed my mind the most, the criminal faction when i started playing as a criminal, i was followed by enforcers non-stop so they could witness and then kill me without giving me a chance to even blink  this game could be a lot better if the devs actually put a lot more thought into the game
633	1	a	I don't know why, but i really recommend this game. Good soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, cool gameplay. Just play it! No matter if these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that pay by 'Microtransactions' are rekting ya. Just have fun! &lt;3
10051	0	a	Wasting time simulator ;D
559	1	a	Oh APB....better known as ALWAYS PLAYERS BlTCHING.  Tutorial: Covers almost nothing besides basic movment. Grahpics: For a game released in 2010, it looks decent, however it is very poorly optimized and basic system requirements will net you about 5 fps. Gameplay: Honestly? It at times can be great, and other times it makes you rage so hard your skin turns green. Between the hackers (which some people will refuse exsist in this game) the tryhards, and the game just downright screwing you over, you will get mad at this game. Playerbase: Filled with trolls and children.  This game is basiclly a GTA MMO. And being F2P they have done a great job keeping it from being P2W. Now on the downside, there are hackers like any other game. Only problem is, those are the same hackers who have played for YEARS. The next issue is the massive egos players have and the complete cesspool community. Played EVE? Imagine that and multiply it by 100. Yeap, that bad. If you can get passed the ignorant children and the known hackers, this game is hands down the best game I have played. I have around 4500 hours, don't let steam fool you. It wasn't always on steam. It's worth a download.   APB features much more than just mission based PvP. You can deisgn your own clothing, cars, symbols, music, themes, etc. They also offer fightclubs which is a fast way to get in the action if you only have a small ammount of time to play such a game.   Be warned however, the cash shop is VERY over priced. So much over priced a single gun runs you about the price of a new video game. Do not buy anything unless it goes on sale, which happens fairly often.
854	1	a	Poor mans GTA with twice the cancer. Devs don't care and community is very poor. This however, has kept me entertained for quite a while. So it may work for you. Just don't sink any money into this, its not worth it.
237	1	a	If you take your time and get used to the world and weapons you will do fine. Sure this game has a few hackers but so what? If you actually have some common sense and skill you can still beat them. I love this game! T ~ T
935	1	a	Its like Saints row, but free
1485	1	a	Love this!
1982	1	a	Yo
7039	0	a	It is an ok game but it kind of runs slow on my pc . Also its not that fun to play to me.
581	1	a	The embodiment of the phrase 'Pay to Win' whomever has mommy's credit card wins the misson hands down. The missons are exactly the same idea everytime, break into this , kill that, find this etc.   With all its flaws its still good for about an hour of fun before you get frustrated or realize that its truly not worth your time.  4/10
2834	1	a	Like GTA you can customize character,car and many more.you must try it!!
4914	0	a	Too many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ enforcers, not fun when the experianced guys pick on newbies. #NotCoolMan #JustNo
6522	0	a	The game seemed promising enough at first but when I got in a car I noticed the most peculiar of happenings. The driving lagged...a lot. like when I tried to turn left, it wouldn't turn for like a second or so after I pressed the button, leading to some frustrating driving. This one seemingly insignificant drawback successfully ruined the game for me.   Final Verdict: 2/10
7171	0	a	It was a great game until they change the game. The server so laggy when they put the server together {west and east}. Building load slow, bad community and banned for no reason even if its 'skills'. I believe the banning is causing the game to be low population 'silver is now gold' from what i heard. I hope they fix the game ASAP or its gonna go POOF.
310	1	a	It's really fun when you get a bunch of friends to play with you. But if you don't, it's only meh.
6167	0	a	Well, first of all... the game is great, the only problam is when I try to exit, and its a big problam. I have a computer with exactly the recommended system requierments but it still crashes... (blue screen /:)
1967	1	a	10 out of 10
10601	1	a	Very quick gameplay that takes a long time to get used to, but when you do, this game becomes really fun.
8803	0	a	You see a lot of the cool ads and all of the cool character customizations... when you get into the game all you get is confusion with no tutorial (or I didn't get any) and the game is just bland and boring.
4302	0	a	Lets just say this is not the APB reloaded I remember...
10823	1	a	From what I remmember it was like Halo
6635	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-
2493	1	a	Sexy game.
9223	0	a	No, I dont recommend this game.
9326	0	a	Terrible controls are clunkey and are some what delayed pros:  1. not hard to run 2.decent story  cons:  EVERYTHING ELSE  dont waste your time on this game
2402	1	a	Hell of a game. mugging, robbing, and missions. Own this now.
7187	0	a	I do not reccomend anyone to waste his time by playing this game. It's poorly made and very inbalanced. The match-making system is terribly broken. You'll often find yourself, a low lvl 5 guy against lvl 200 players. It's very frustrating, progress is very slow and unrewarding. The game is very poorly made and optimized, the physics engine is terrible, steering lags a whole 3-4 seconds making car driving close to imposible. The game is full of trolls and rammers and the overall atmosphere of this game is of hate. The most commonly typed sentence in this game is 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ y0u N00B di3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!' Many players were banned for no reason because of an upsurge of cheaters and with every patch the game just keeps getting worse, the only additions being new stuff to rob money from you with. I DO NOT Reccomend this garbage to anyone.
7018	0	a	This whole playtime it was just me trying to open the game and log in. Created two accounts and it would still not let me log in, I stated my real age which is 18 but apperantly I'm too young to play the game. The game does not close nor open normally and you cannot alt+tab while in any part of the game. The in-game logos at the start are un-skipable and it's just completely a mess...
1631	1	a	People are â¥â¥â¥â¥, devs tryina jew the money outta you, can be buggy and rather demanding on your system. 10/10 if you're a lil â¥â¥â¥â¥ just like them.
1840	1	a	When APB first came out it was a fun and interesting Idea, many many balance problems but the future looked bright, that was until 3 weeks after the game was released it was shutdown due to 0 cash and 0 cash means no company means no servers. Eventually G1 picked it up and relaunched it with some minor tweaks and all was good except no compensation for players who previously bought the game. History aside now lets get into it, this will be fairly short.  Gameplay is alright, G1 surprisingly continued to develope the game and not just let it be a cash grab completely. The rework to the economy where you rent guns rather than buy sucks, a lot. the poor hacker prevention is terrible but hackers dont run to terribly rampant and low skill players wont run into them hardly at all. All in all its interesting, with a fairly par shooting mechanic, and a nice amount of customisation for the free player and a lot for the subscriber. I never feel like I have to subscribe even though I have on a few special occasion when I play for more than a month at a time. Something about it keeps pulling me back time and time again, sometimes just a few days, or a month. but just like EVE online for me I just cant quit it for long. (although in APB I'm not blacklisted by multiple corps for abandoment and possible spy ect ect.)  overall. 6/10 a good fun time but come expecting that you are gonna spend possibly 20 minutes at a time just being bent over and taking it from all sides while you can do nothing but throw your body on an objective praying that you dont get turned to tiny gibs of goo and being reminded that you got pwnd by all sorts of catchy or horribly annoying theme songs.
1308	1	a	it's â¥â¥â¥â¥'in amazing
1769	1	a	OK Game. The graphics are alright, and you have a fun experience.
5383	0	a	You know a game is bad when you press the 'start' button and it just sends you to a Facebook page to leave a 'like'.
7781	0	a	Well I cant even play the game because when i click play the launcher appears then disappears, but it looks like a fun game i waited a year for this game to get better but it still does not work but after a while i will try again but for right now i don't think so
2298	1	a	Not much to say, addicting â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
8807	0	a	This game has people that spend money on items that are either perm or temp. Before their were any hackers but now we got aim hackers and speed hackers everywhere and the anti cheat is just plain garbage. If you dont spend real life money on this game you will not get anywhere unless you get boosted. I get 1 shot by a pistol when my shotgun cant even kill them close range which is what it is meant for. I wouldnt recommend this game if you dont wanna waste money. But if you do then go ahead.
2501	1	a	DUDE YOU GOT TO FIX THIS I CANT EVEN PLAY
1110	1	a	Hackers, Aimbots, Scum of the earth...  That's the APB you know and love. No matter how many times this game kicks you when you're down, you'll always come crawling back!
9443	1	a	It's a loading simulator, not a MMORPG of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  10/10 loading sim
2648	1	a	This game is very fun! You can do many things and it has that one thing GTA 5 dosen't have a Cops and Robbers mode and this game is entirely based on Cops and Robbers. Each has there own Vehicles and Weapons very fun and i really recommend this game mostly for Roleplayers or Cop Lovers!
9087	0	a	trash game lol i made a character named 'dog tounge tribal leader' i met up with my friend 'onion bread' and we basically â¥â¥â¥â¥ed off for a couple of hours. After finding out that crafting is a day-long process in real time, (legit some stuff takes 30 minutes + to craft) yeah it sucks :( also third party acccount or sum â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that.
6963	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
4042	0	a	i am still having log in issues with this trash game 
1015	1	a	+ Fun game. - Idiotic community. - Pay 2 Win. 
3035	1	a	Quick fun gameplay, right from the begin!
10543	1	a	  Slide and shoot stuff for free.
890	1	a	Pay2Win in a nutshell. The game has a magnificant concept but it has been executed terribly. You can't stand up against people who have paid for the game in both customization and actual PvP. However, the games funny physics and hilarious outfits, it surely does bring a few laughs, especially when you group up with a pair of buddies. It's an incredibly fun game aslong as you have a fair game, and if you don't mind paying for a game to have fun, this is recommended - Aslong as you got a good enough computer to handle it!
446	1	a	Great and unique game, lots of customization and cars / weaponry to suit everyones needs, fun mission objectives, almost no mission is the same in regards of what can happen, regular events and just alot to do overall. The downside is it hasn't recieved too many game changing updates in awhile other than the anti-cheat system but that's about to change with the engine update coming out awhile from now, which will make the developers have the ability of implimenting new content such as maps and game modes. It can also be somewhat difficult for new players considering the people with thousands of hours will basically demolish you in most scenarios, but given time you can learn.  (Also customization really only kicks in when you eirther get premium through events or purchase it with real money, which is rather unfortunate)  Summary: Solid game with great content and customization but limited unless you have premium and is also difficult to beginners.
4364	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
5354	0	a	It locked me in the game where i couldent change the volume or exit the game 0/1000
6080	0	a	How the worm has turned!  from the best game I ever played to a set of scamming â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s who are not in any way interested in what the community needs or wants.  G1 have totally killed APB and turned it in to nothing more than a cash cow.  I will never play this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ again.  Makes me feel sick that i supported this bunch of crooks.
4660	0	a	This is the definition of Pay 2 Win.
6850	0	a	Download to watch a duel with your anti virus software.
8514	0	a	Anyone know why i cannot join the game. Im from mongolia so i think its restricted or something. It said this acc is already on use or some error numbers. For the developers fix this thing if you create this game for people to play. Make things full pleasure. Not for money. For future technology of game.You can make money from this but not just for money. Remember this. for the review i give 4/10. Who have same problem and same feelings with me ??
6152	0	a	This game is a lot of fun specially with friends sadly this is a pay to win game.
2375	1	a	APB RELOADED is one of the best online multiplayer game i have ever played! This game is manely fun with your freinds but dont let that stop you from getting this game, the game is still fun without friends all im saying is when you are playing with friends on this game you pee yourself in laughter even more than you do on your own playing this game. I like how you can creat and customize your charecter and make yourself look like a complete BADASS, also you can even customize your own car to make just as equally as BADASS as your charecter. You get a choice of being a Emfocer or a crimanal, you can pick diffrent districs and locations to spawn at and also you can even make your own group or join a group. There is so much good things to say about this game but i will just end it with this.......of the few hours i have been playing this game i have fell in love with it i like this game more than anyother game i own or have now. WARNING THIS GAME MAY BECOME ADDICTIVE!
7098	0	a	This tryhard tried hard to like this game but it fails hard especially as a FTP.  Lots of neat customizations but none of that can make up for the repetitive missions and gameplay. Having no PVE you can only progress in the game by playing the missions against players. Most of the time I get put up against high level 'Premium' players who resort to cowardly tactics. Players will mostly try to run you over or use explosives. Cant shoot driver out of car. They like camping with a supply box and spamming grenades. Apparently OP pistols and submachine gun pistols seems to be favored.  Despite being the first to fire, being accurate with the rifle, hitting them 50 times (no joke) they can snipe you with a pistol or rush right up to you and kill you in 10 shots sometimes less. Yet those same players get attitude and send whispers calling me a noob and a cheater the moment I manage to kill them which seems quite ironic. All in all that I can still find a few good challenging matches with nice people where the ammount of effort to kill/be killed is equal. Sadly the game either has a major gap between level, Premium, or lacks legit players. 
9103	1	a	Fun for awhile. Boring after a while. Played with friends 2 hours in total and got deeply anoid with how this game plays out  5/10 Meh gameplay. Fun for teamplayers
7858	0	a	APB Reloaded is a game where I can assume the dominant role in a 'Cops vs. Crooks' s&amp;m environment.
4473	0	a	A lot of weapons are P2W and many say obtainable by F2P if you play long enough, but there IS weapons you can't get being F2P which a lot of people use and murder with, over all, if you want a good shooter, don't expect to be good even with amazing aim. :/  -Customization is amazing though, I'm sad it's crushed out by the horrid shooting mechs.
5200	0	a	The name of this game should be: Pay to Win Reloaded This game is THE definition of Pay to Win. There's next to no content available for anyone who doesn't want to spend money on this pile of trash. The gameplay is completely unfair when fighting morons who spent money on the game. The driving is terrible, the gameplay is slightly less grindy than Destiny, and the environments are bland and boring. The only thing good about this game is the amount of customization possible. You can put anything you want on nearly anything. Put the N word on your shirt, on your car, on your own body as a tattoo, and around the world as a large spraypainted image. Roleplaying as a member of the KKK has never been so easy.
10715	1	a	Quite a nice game for F2P. Very fast paced if you like that. But it seems it has lost lots of its players and developer support.
4	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a storied past of a launch that ultimately failed and a company that resurrected a product that many probably believe should've been left to die. Where Realtime Worlds failed to deliver a perfect product, however, GamersFirst has slapped on a number of band-aids and made the best of a bad situation. And we thank them for it.  The main issues of APB Reloaded are in its very particular hardware requirements that will cause the game to hang and crash unless you can work around them - and the deplorable and oft-buggy implementation of the mostly useless PunkBuster service, which has a bad habit of kicking players for its inability to function without initializing services on your PC that often won't load, or can't be found. However, if you can power thorugh, find fixes for and look past the game's shortcomings, the game itself is a blast to play.  The game offers a small but well-designed pair of open-world combat maps wherein you are randomly assigned missions through their well-implemented matchmaking system and battle it out on the streets with handguns, shotguns, fully automatic weapons and much more in what is essentially games of 'Capture the Flag,' 'King of the Hill,' 'Deathmatch' and many more orthodox PvP mainstays. You won't find a lot of new innovations in gameplay, but what the game does, it does well. Game balance is fine-tuned over many years of service, and more recently, it's far less common to see people using aimbots or hacking than it was even a year ago.  The game is at its most frustrating when you find yourself up against players who have, through microtransactions, secured weaponry or vehicles that are very difficult to acquire as a free player. At times, the game feels like a 'Pay to Win' Freemium nightmare, but it still remains skill-based, and though the rich among us have an edge, a veteran TPS player will still find themselves winning as often as they lose. This said, those afraid of the Free-to-Play model, steer clear! This is not the game for you.  The shining point of APB is in its character customization. Peerless in multiplayer games, it allows astounding volume in character creation options, going beyond even facial generation and into custom-made personal decals on the abundant clothing options and tattoos, which you are able to project and position freely on your avatar. No two players look exactly alike, though there are a lot of less imaginitive people who prefer to make Marvel Superheroes or TV characters. And surprisingly, the game holds up graphically even today.  It is a flawed, but ultimately very fun game that you can easily spend hours on.
1082	1	a	this is a good game becuase it has a uninstall botton
9231	1	a	If you do not receive an e-mail within 5-10 minutes, please try registering your account again.  ... F*cking registering 50 times again and again.  10/10 would lose 1 hour again.  I recomend this game :/

487	1	a	APB reloaded is a great open world 3D Massively Multiplayer shooter. This game is great and I seriously recommend this game to vetern game players. The game has some negative things like Pay2Win assets that allows rich spoiled people to have everything they desire from a one hit kill assault rifle. To a 1 second reload rocket launcher with a radius of the base of the Pentagon. It also has much trouble with people 'Hacking' as some people call it. However its just a simple means of people downloading Aimbots for it and ruining everyones gaming experience. If this were to be No Pay2Win and you could buy this game for 5 USD. And have a decent ban system and anti 'Hack' system. It would be worth the 5 USD. 9/10 without Aimbotters.
4402	0	a	You pretty much just get tossed into this game with absolutely no clue what you're expected to do and somewhere between few and no tutorials to explain how to do it. After fumbling around my first five minutes, I eventually picked up a quest to go capture some criminal....on the other side of the city. With no car to drive to him.   Ten minutes of running later, I realize this guy is moving. Five minutes later I realize it's another PC i'm chasing. 5 seconds later i'm dead, and I respawn halfway across the city from my target.   I was done at that point.

9542	1	a	this is best game i played because it is nuke and u survive in earth wow
866	1	a	how do i say this, its like a hybrid of marijuana and cancer, it can spread to people, its cancerous, its addicting and it makes you wanna killyourself
5317	0	a	Simple and Easy : Pay2win...
4585	0	a	Unfortunately, while this game is unique in that you unlock clothes and character customizations as you play, you have to deal with trolls and hackers (which unfortunately the game devs vehemently deny, because of their 'hackguard software' is good... Like 6 years ago..) Some days the trolling can be so bad, that when I do play anymore, I am usually sitting on roofs sniping NPC characters with a handgun or using the van that I eventually unlocked to smash storefronts to rob them.. Missions are only really enjoyable if you have friends playing with you that can calm you down when you end up queued against a team of max rank gold players whom are only on your server to troll because they claim to not be able to fill their own gold server (which they have and have had for several years) but in actuallity prefer trolling people that they know that they can beat (Less experienced players), rather than fighting people of their own calibur. Weapons are another can of worms all together. Permanent box weapons, which can cost you an arm and a leg, can turn an unskilled player into god with no effort whatsoever, even the rank unlocked guns and cars are junk next to the purple and gold weapons and cars in the G1 and Joker stores. On a side note, I do have a few permanent weapons and cars, from owning the retail version of the game, but even those are inadequate to the newer stuff that comes out every few months. At least my retail cars have mobile supply to let me change out gear in the middle of town.  Still it is much funner to ride around town shooting NPC, mugging, storefront robbery and grand theft auto, then playing the missions with unfair ranking. Money can even be made if you learn how to manipulate the Music Maker and clothes designers and sell what you make on the players market. I used to make money nearly everyday selling death tunes in the tune of Nyan Cat and Still Alive. The company claims to have unfair ranking and hacking under control, but this cannot always be seen when playing.
7044	0	a	While the game has a great idea behind it, still one of the best around when it comes to character customization possibilities and has nicely flowing combat (if your pc can handle it), sadly the game is riddled with faults. Declining population, constantly rerolling cheaters who just can create new account as soon as previois one gets banned (which takes ungodly amount of time for them to do despite having 2 anti-cheat systems running), bad netcode causing loads of desync issues, servers failing to run at intended tickrate, etc...  That being said, if you're still interested to see it yourself after these warnings, why not give it a go? Just expect total misery and the game may happily suprise you (bet it won't in most cases though).
3662	1	a	this game could really use melee weapons and a skill try so the player can build his/her character and i would love to bet the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of people with a baseball bat or something but besides that it is pretty fun 
5038	0	a	No Australian servers so the latency is just awful and in most cases unplayable, it was originally disigned by Realtime Worlds but they sold the half finished piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the K2 network for 2 million dollars... not that the game wouldn't be fun and enjoyable but it is still quite bad, on the plus side the character customization is insane, much like The Sims only without the clothes option. I honestly don't know why they can't just get off their lazy asses and get some Australian servers?
2373	1	a	Best online 3PS game by now
10029	0	a	Looking at this, I was expecting a Fallout-ish experience. I was mistaken, but not by much. Don't let the play time fool you, I played a good 50 hours of this outside of Steam. Pros: -Crafting -Exploration -Factions -Multiple starts -Many weapons -Steampunk feel -Reminiscent of New Vegas without being a clone -Very open  Cons: -Glitchy -Crafting system is a bit confusing -PvP is populated almost entirely by hackers -Optimizatin is â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Players are generally ill-tempered -AI isn't verry Intelligent -Quests can be a handful at times -Aiming likes to twitch, making long-range shots hard -Leveling system is a pain  Neutral: -Tutorial can be a bit confusing on your first run through -Graphics are a bit dated -Kinda empty (Not sure if they're going for the 'Wasteland' feel)  Overall, it's fun to play with friends for a week or two, but not something I'd sink another 50 hours into
945	1	a	Gta is better :P (ofc)
4018	0	a	While the graphics are good, it lacks in storyline and general flow. Nothing is really clear when you start the game, the map is confusing. Character Customization is good when you first start but if you want to customize further in the game with things such as weapons, or clothing then its very difficult and expensive. Combat is one-sided, with you being the lesser side and rather often dying and you're always resurrected way back at the beginning where you first started. Its gets a bit easier if you are playing it with friends but not that much. All in all out of 10, I'd give it about 4/10.
2023	1	a	Definitely a fun game! Even on a crappy computer like mine I still find a lot of joy in this game.
4165	0	a	Being that this is a shooter, I would kind of appreciate more button mapping options for controllers. The defaults are akward and clunky. And the tutorial is difficult to manuver when you are trying to learn the new buttons. So this one didn't last very long with me, even though I am aware that my opinion won't be popular amongst the MMO community.
1102	1	a	this game is bay 2 win fun 
5709	0	a	Run around, shoot people, blow stuff up, it's all the same. APB Reloaded? What does 'Reloaded' have to do with this game? I'll tell you: nothing. APB Reloaded is a GTA clone whose only characteristic that sets it apart is the fact that it's free. Who doesn't want a free-to-play, third-person shooter where the goal is to ruin people's lives? The game itself is fine: I can tell the devolpers tried very hard, but APB has very little lastability. After a 20 minute game session, I'm tired of using cars to block the entrances to the main hubs of the map, I'm tired of crashing my cars into other players, in fact, I had more fun screwing around in this game than acually playing the missions. After a while, I had to create my own fun. Is that what you want in a game?   Because I know that I don't.  Nice try, but no cigar.
10129	1	a	This game is actually so much fun. Yeah it's mostly a rip off of Fall out new vagas, but not everyone can afford games like fall out. This is a great FREE game that's loads of fun, but it does have some really stupid achievements.
1182	1	a	This game is incredibly frustrating. But play it, because at the same time, It's one of the best F2P Shooters I've found.

10227	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
9453	0	a	is it bad? i dont know
437	1	a	This MMO is crazy fun. It's just massively multiplayer, cops vs. crimnals, Grand Theft Auto style ridiculousness. The in-game transactions are totally optional and not necessary. You can enjoy this game for hours upon hours for free.
7623	0	a	This game is really bad, the only fun thing was finding a fast car to drive. I liked that I could really customize my character only to finding my character would spawn as a floating hair peace, eyes, a mouth, a pair of shoes and a floating gun. The missions made no sense and had no direction on how to perform the job,let alone could you find your health or change that set up making game-play too complicated, as well as, the game was easy to hack, a conversation happened in chat and next thing I know every car you touched exploded, or people shooting infinite grenades and lagging the server. If you hadn't fallen through the ground yet the game crashes instead, dying instantly as you spawn,pvp glitching the f out and making everyone try to kill you and being stuck looking at your dead body with out being able to re-spawn. At first I liked that I could add my music to the 'in-game player', until I found that the game corrupted all of my music(mp3,mp2) on my PC... by the way that includes game music/sounds for other games!, cut scenes with no sound, like playing any game on mute. If your thinking theirs an update for this game the last one was almost a year ago.. it's not going to happen. Don't even try the game!
6935	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again

5891	0	a	Not really good. I thought this was going to be like a gta but foer pc and free. it is. the aspects are great but i find the game unplayable due to the fact that it takes a second for the game to register that you pressed a button.

9079	0	a	Horrible just flat out horrible. Tried this game when it first came out and you could only play the first few mins then you were stuck in a room going nowhere cause they wanted you to play to play. Gave it another go a week agaon and holy crap it sucks. Not sure how it got a Metacritic score of 71, but dont waste your time on this one.
7035	0	a	I cant eaven start the game with these all errors game 0/11 go nahui game
5736	0	a	To be honest i haven't played the game in a while but i just re-installed to see what has changed but other than that the game was good, I used to play it alot then the game just went downhill and I uninstalled. It is also very pay to win.
3113	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
7776	0	a	This game's anti cheat/hack system is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.Kicks you out when ever you attempt to login b/c it thinks you are cheating. Not to mention this game is super glitchy. I can't even play for five minutes before it freezes or boots me out. 0/10
1900	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
4432	0	a	Weak gameplay, riddled with cheaters with no obstacles to stop them. I could literally download hacks and play on the servers with a very small risk of being banned. The devs are so inflated they literally boast in the chat that they have banned one person from the server. The gunplay is weak, vehicle mechanics are choppy, cluttered ui, difficult learning curve(minus cheaters) and looks as though they don't put enough attention into the aspects of the game that really matter. When they start focusing on improving the mechanics while also establishing a viable anti cheat then i will consider this game to be mediocore.
1556	1	a	I just got a free Minecraft gift code from ï»¿http://freeminecraftgiftcode
3093	1	a	Good game to play at random moments. Like gta 5 but in a simply version
3492	1	a	its like GTA so its cool
1165	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ me in the â¥â¥â¥
4204	0	a	Its a decent game, with great content. but all of the weapons and vehicles are purchased for 1 day, 7 days, month, or permanent. Permanent costs real money or so much money it would take you weeks to months to afford a car. Game is a basic pay to win game, with content that requires ingame money that you can take FOREVER, or you can use real money to get what you want. If you have multiple friends that play this game, then investing is not a bad idea. GTA 5 is a newer version of a freeroam MMO, but lacks the content as APB/ customization.
573	1	a	she wants the D.

2371	1	a	it cools
4164	0	a	I'll save you a lot of download time and stress. This game sucks from tutorial on forward.   First, the graphics for such a huge game are not impressive. It's basic at best, and the latency is horrible. How can you play a FPS with everyone on server having +600 ms ping? You can't. Uninstall reason #1.   The tutorial is horrible. There is a list of things to do, but nowhere does it explain what to do or how. You constantly have to press the 'help' key to review quests. Even then, it is confusing and boring.   So you finally complete some tutorial quests and see people driving all over, smashing, talking â¥â¥â¥â¥, being trolls. Now you have to observe a crime? I observed many, nothing is a 'crime' according to this game.   Sum up this game real fast.   A bunch of cash shopping trolls using the sand box as a chat room and abusing the imbalanced missions with friends. Why are 99% of the cash shoppers females? I'm guessing it's Napoleon complex inferior kids and ladyboy caitlyn jenner wannabes in a dead sandbox of very limited repetitive boring missions with garbage combat gameplay.   I was hoping for something more like Tom Clancy Ghost Recon with some GTA. Instead I got a old UT2000 generic gaming engine with runescape questing and combat.   8/10 waste of hard drive space 7/10 waste of download time 9/10 for â¥â¥â¥â¥ game of transgender trolls 11/10 would tell off the global chat before uninstalling again

10324	0	a	cant even log in
2661	1	a	There are a few thing I have to say about this game. It grabbed my attention because it was a cops vs. robbers type game that would keep me entertained for hours. First the cons, very repetitive, stupid A.I., cars are difficult to drive, and hard to play at first (minimal problem). Now the pros, great customization, fair for starters, teamwork is required trying to lone wolf it will get you killed, good music, own kill theme, and NPC's run away when there is gunfire.  There are some other things I want to talk about before I finish, all of the players look the same unless you look at the arrows on their head, as said before, you have to work as a team mainly because this is a team game so you have to stick with the team you have because without them you could be going 5 to 1, and the game will be extremely repetitive so you will get bored within 10 days of downloading it (maybe less) only two types of missions.  This game is a fun experience when you begin playing it and gets boring within a short amount of time, but the amount of fun you can have can be worth it if you really want to invest the time.  7/10
4800	0	a	You cannot purchase any permant weapons without spending real life cash. Did my very first mission in the game with another new player and did not stand a fighting chance against our opponent who had far superior weapons then the basic starter gear. This is deffinately a Pay to Win game by design would avoid at all cost unless you want to spend a lot of money to be stand a fighting chance in this game.

7028	0	a	The game is VERY cool and funny, BUT it have 2 things that totally SUCKS:  -The matchking, u may play against players with LOTS of reputation ( levels ) more than you, i was 59 and i was matched against people with R 149, 229, etc, SUCKS!  -The weapons store, i have just 4 days playing and i have to play against people with more experience AND premium weapons, that means perfect damage, aiming, lots of bullets, etc, and they earn double exp and money than normal people, i understand its common you can buy premium isues BUT the difference between premium and normal is too high, the premium moddified weapons are so stupidly overpowered .   So, if you have money to buy premium stuff, welcome! enjoy it! but if you dont, dont even try this game, because ur only going to lose.

5987	0	a	Bad company. 1- Many bugs in-game 1- bad community 1-
3764	0	a	To make this short: I played this a few years ago, and had a blast. Elistist were few and in between, Game mechanics were nice, Customization was awesome. I tried picking it up again, hell, put 20 more hours into it, but I can't get past the Huge, absolutely Huge elitist base it has now. As a silver, it would make sense to be on a server that is meant for silvers (A silver server) and fight people at roughly my skill level, as that's how the rating system goes. However, Max Rank (255, I'm 96, takes about an 2-3 hours a rank) Gold players with over 2000 hours of playtime are your only constant enemies. They claim that they can't fill their own servers so they play on our silver, when they have a gold server dedicated to them, but In truth they just want to waste their lives away absolutely stomping anyone trying to enter the fanbase of this game. The greatest curse is not the pernament weapon p2win, but it's the community devouring itself with inbalance of skill.   If you knew you would lose absolutely every single game, why would you bother staying in the game? That's this games motto. The Golds act like Jerks to everyone, with heavy elitist attitudes, and are unstoppable because they have 1000% (literally) more game time then you do. There's no reason to play or join into the game because you can not win no matter what you do. On top of that, They complain because the fanbase is dwindling in numbers (about 100-200 people on at once, which is very small,) and in that, they justify their mad stomping out of weaker, much less experienced players. This game deserves to be condemned and shut down because of it's terrible Elistist structure. 
2186	1	a	Very fun, very exciting and it makes me hard! This game has so much to it, there is almost never something to not do, but warned little wallets, they vant ur moneyz I do not recommend purchasing ANYTHING for this game, it's a free game, it's fun to keep it that way
3489	1	a	A horrible example of grand theft auto. You do missions but it was all PVP. There was hardly any info on the game other than 'awesome' descriptions that don't match the actual game after 2 hours of play.  The community around the game was just as bad, nobody answering questions on the chat channels or even trying to group up. Leave it all to auto-queue and don't bother trying to make friends inside the game.
5560	0	a	S**t
1320	1	a	lemme get this out first: THIS IS A FREE TO PLAY!!! The community is 50-50 (good-sucks) and many people are pay-to-win. But if you put enough effort, you'll find yourself fragging enemies in no time.
6669	0	a	its got bugs and it does not work on my pc but it looks awsome
10550	1	a	UPDATE:  Dear Tribes,   It's been a while hasn't it? For a long time our relationship had been on the rocks, and after years of neglect I finally had to call it quits between us. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. But then you call me out of the blue, swearing up and down that you changed and begging for me to come back! I was understandably skeptical, but to my surprise you really did it! Look, I know things still aren't perfect between us, but in love you can never expect perfection. You're trying, and that's all that matters to me.  Sorry we fought.   10/10 - Would marry all over again.
1393	1	a	It's true that this game is Pay to Win and it's not exactly newb friendly.  But if you manage to ignore the many deaths you have and just continue playing the game just to have fun instead of trying to win everything, you're in for some lots of fun.  Now I know this game is unfair at the most. But play this game long enough and just ignore all the deaths you get. Sure enough you'll get decent equipment so you won't die so much.  You just have to have patience guys. Also, bring a friend if you can.

9572	0	a	Took 7 hours to download and it didn\'t work. 
5921	0	a	If you dont have good mouse, mouse pad, sensitivity, good nerves , then this game is not recommended for you. This game can turn you into nervewreck.  Not recommending. -Got killed by a grenade which blew up on the other side of the wall. -Was driving at enemy, he shot with bazooka at me, I blew up, car flew and dropped on top of him, he survived. -If you sit on top of grenade when it exploads, you dont die unless you on low health. -Veterans whining about hackers in district chat when they lose, while they act ruthless against beginners/noobs. -Bad matchmaking. Beginners are putten against veterans. Matches might end up 0 kills on one side and 20 kills on other. -Rating system. You gain better weapons as you play this game and become better, giving you ever more easier way to kill beginners. -No reward if you did your best but failed. Some matches you might end up playing 5-10min and gain nothing. -Players can drive on top of other people cars. Like what the hell. -Players can jump over cars that are driving towards them. Again, what the hell. -Lack of shooting or dodging tutorials. There are moments when you waste entire clip on enemy while for him it takes only 5 bullets to kill you. Veteran basically jumps around doing zig zag dance, dodging your bullets, even if he takes hit, there is no pentalty for him. -This is too fast paced with no penalty when taking hit. -Fast regenerating health. -Pay to win. You can buy premium guns.    
259	1	a	If you didn't get what you excepted from GTA Online. This game is freaking perfect for you. It's way much better than GTA Online. First of all, It's open world in a server for 90 players. There are 5 different maps(excluding special maps for special days). There are so many online things you can do in the offline mod of GTA series. You should definitely give it a shot.
673	1	a	puts a fun creative spin on cops and robbers with the adition of guns,cars and hole lot of customization toping it of with the fact  its massmultiplayer and free roam U CAN BE CRIMANLES AND KILL TINGS CAUSE U KNOW THATS WHAT CRIMS DO
585	1	a	For a free to play game this is fantastic, while i have some complaints overall its really good, much potential
5904	0	a	You'll only enjoy this game if your good. Other than that its a rage fest. Its not a pay to win, but as I said you need skill to enjoy the game or win it. Other than that the customization is amazing, but you need premium to put more than 5 decals on a car, 25 decals in an emblem, or 5 decals on clothing. The matchmaking is a complete mess, new people will really have a hard time when they get matched up with veterans...  I only recommend this game if you have the patience to die a lot.
1279	1	a	Meh it's fun for awhile
7891	0	a	To be honest, if you wanna enjoy this game be prepared to spend at least 300 dollars more on it. The average is 1500 dollars.  Enjoy your pay to win free to play game.
967	1	a	THIS GAME IS MY LIFE :c
6019	0	a	This game basically needs a bit of cash splashed onto it to work. its a good f2p game but, you need to pay money to get good guns to do good. using the in-game currency to buy perma-guns would be nice. This game handles itself strangely. pay like 35 in-game credits for a permanant clothing item but pay 1300 credits for a leased gun. The artwork that people post for this game looks nice.  A remake (or sequel) would be nice (if there was no need to pay real money). Hit detection can be S.H.I.T but if you pay like 100 usd to buy a SINGLE permanent gun you won't have a problem. And as RELOADED ENT. are money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s they sell in THE CASH SHOP leased guns. LIKE WTF. don't play until it gets made better.
9112	1	a	Finding this oddly addicting,  looking forward to future development 
115	1	a	Well, APB is third person. It is free to play. Amazing anti-cheat. Been banned 5 times for some reason. But don't worry, if you get banned, you can Email G1 customer support and they will help you a whole lot. If you have no luck with G1 support, use Punkbuster support. They will help you alot and tell you that you have been banned by Punkbuster services. After 2200 hours, you should have become the best player in your server. If not, then you should invest some of your hard-earned money into the ARMAS Marketplace where you can find weapons exactly the same as the contact weapons. You do not want to get good at this game. Trust me. When you get very skilled at this game, People will begin to hackusate you and you will get reported, and banned. This game is a awesome solid rank of 4.7/10, for its great ability to customize your character and vehicle, and the amazing community. Everybody in the community is so very nice after you beat them in a mission by saying 'Good game', and 'Damn, you scary. I will try harder next time'.

5665	0	a	Pay2Win + â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gunplay= â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game Yeah, It's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥. Just get GTA and get over it, Jeez.
7999	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.
6811	0	a	Reloaded Productions turned this fine game into poop, it is not like RTW anymore.
9158	1	a	This is a very fun game i enjoyed it so far and this is nothing like fallout if think that you can die
2073	1	a	Dont let my steam play hours fool you. I've been playing APB off and on again sense Key to the City was a 3 day early access pre-order bonus under RTW (makers of the game) and not a +$90 cash shop bundle. So iv got closer to 500-1000hrs.  This game was great in its early years. This is the game that got me into PC gaming. This is the game i joined my first clan in. Nothing is more fun than a GTA style mmo. I dont even know how to write a review about this game so im just gonna do another Pros and Cons.  Pros:  Gameplay - its just plain fun to play cops and robbers Competitive - people talk trash and tbag. If your a big baby then dont play this game. There are REALLY good players that will seem like they are hacking but most aren't. Ranking - theres Green, bronze, silver and gold that indicates your win to lose ratio. Customization - ITS CRAZY. It no Illustrator but some artists could fool me. Thereâs little more thatâs as satisfying than when you sell a car and you run into the person that bought it in game. Guns - Guns, guns, guns. I love guns. Down bullets go. Into ur torso. mm mm mm. Little guns, big guns, guns that go boom. i lovem all. 1-3 mod slots with each mod having their own pros and cons. Prebuilt guns if you not a high level for slotted ones too. Missions - Theres only a hand full but there's enough variety and locations on the map where they take place that you hardly notice.  TDM - eh, not my thing but people like it. I like to have a mission instead of just running around shooting peopl. Music - you can play music from your PC in game to feel like a badass. I'm not entirely sure how it works now but it used to be if the game didn't know what the song was it would play it for you and play a song of the same genera for others.  Cons: Pay to win (?) - it used to be VERY pay to win. in the last week or so that iv started playing again i havenât noticed this as much. Prices - A single gun can cost $40 to keep it permanently. Luckily thereâs a try it first mode. Renting guns - you donât buy a gun with in game money and keep it. you rent it for 10 days, buy the ammo and rent the gun again if you like it. Its a cash sink to get you to pay for the monthly sub. Im not gonna list the sub as a con because you only need 2-3 months of it to get what you want. Crybabies - SOOO many people cry hacker. People will just sit back and let the timer run out on the mission or straight up rage quit adding another loss to your ratio. In the early days my clan was accused of hacking almost every match. Its hilarious sometimes. Ranking - this is also a con because of the lack of gold ranked people. Almost all servers are rated for silver or bronze players. If youâre a gold ranking going into a silver or bronze rated server then you get penalties in XP and money. This is to keep golds from rolling over the less skilled people but sense thereâs less people playing these days itâs more of a problem for golds. False Promises - Gamersfirst are just a big bunch of liers. They promised racing maps, more mission maps and bla bla bla it was all a lie. Maps became a chunk of a mission map for TDM and racing maps still donât exist. Racing was supposed to be a way to unlock car parts but i guess they just want cash for that.  I love this game and as long as they keep the hackers out and the P2W model down low, ima keep on loven.  P.S. its bested played with a group so find a clan.
10608	1	a	Used to play this when it was in the beta. Came back when I learned that Hi-Rez renewed its support for the game.  Its a great adrenaline pumping FPS (NO P2W).
8208	0	a	Couldn't even get this thing downloaded, much less play the damn game. I wouldn't reccomend even trying, as they obviously just want to scam you into spending cash.
8204	0	a	Really boring and generic
10648	1	a	cool
3875	0	a	Good potential, Bad company. ;) I rest my case
3351	1	a	great game thou i dont like the player vehicle system where you can only drive ai cars, your car, or people in the same mission you are but other than that really fun open world mmo
8832	0	a	This Game is completly â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up Technicaly; there are a lot of Incohenreces with the objectives wich makes you lower your win/loss ratio wich determines your Level(And the more you loose for no reason, the more it'll be hard to progress since the ratio will change each time more slower). There are huges leaks of Memory wich makes your RAM overflow, if you aint got 4Gb ram minimum you'll crash every 5 hours of continuous playing, The Hitboxes are 9 times larger than the character and the perpetual lags makes you die with the least powerfull weapon.Furthermore the actual developers(not the originals) are just using this game to get money so dont expect anything to be solved.  MEANWHILE, The Concept of this game is so awesome that even if you rage every 10 minutes you WANT to play such a cool game; In other Word the player's possibilities are Infinite, you're able to do quite everything, it would just need some stunts like dashing or rolling on sides.  Concept=1337/10 Development=-666/10
7581	0	a	i dont know it sucks i played this game for 10weeks before it came in steam and then a few hours from steam... they banned me for no reason they said that i had 'hacking' programs in my pc so id suggest pepole do not play it cause the same might happen to you

8886	0	a	  There once was a good dev studio icarus who made this game, and they made it really well, the core game is awesome. Huge world to explore, somewhat interesting story, there's about 400 hrs of pve content, after that you'll ask yourself what's next? Well right now the answer is nothing, with population so low there's no pvp going on, which is actually really fun, even though hard to learn how to do it properly.   This game is not pay to win, I mean I really enjoyed game at first and bought steam package, I don't regret getting it, you can purchase subscription or buy tradeable premium for ingame currency, I bought a lof of them, I always had commander premium and it wasn't hard to earn enough game currency for it, there're multiple ways to make money in game, pve and pvp(but that's not the case now probably as population dropped heavily). I like the game so much that I would even pay for subscription anyway if not one but, and that's a big one, the G1, who bought the game doesn't develop it anymore, they keep 3 or 5 ppl on the staff and they do very little in game, it feels very abandoned. There's no anticheat and there's also ways to dupe in game, they can't fix that, even though some dupers sent them mail telling how to fix it, but they didn't do anything.  it's no longer an mmo, more like a bunch of ppl online, on top of that they downgraded their servers a few times, so there's much more lag, the content that G1 did is unfinished, and it's just a dead side of the map where nothing happens, they ruined the game and as long as they own it I can't recommend this game.  
5016	0	a	Started playing since the Reloaded beta. 2008 graphics/game, but you still need a mid-high end pc to run this without it FREEZING, barely new content has been added in +4 years, clothes, cars and re skinned guns, some cry about p2w but i think it is pure skill because (re skinned guns). 'Developers' (they cannot change game's code) are now trying to do tons of events giving players a lot of stuff for them to unlock certain clothes, etc, that's not enough, the game is dying, population is so damn low. The engine upgrade was meant to be released in Q1 2014, but they have only given some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pictures of the SOCIAL DISTRICT with more foliage and better lighting, not even gameplay. I don't even know how are they thinking of releasing a console version lol. They have to release the engine upgrade or just cancel this 5yr old beta.
264	1	a	An excellent game with a variety of weapons and customizaion. It's fun when playing with friends, but brace yourself for a community worse than CoD.  This game is an excellent addition to your library, and fun to it's full extent when in a group of friends.
5868	0	a	What a clunky, frustrating, and really boring game. Since the game began, there have only been 2 core city maps. Decent sizes but full of really boring and useless things to do. So you do missions endlessly. Now to the game's credit, when you get two teams who are equally balanced and moderately competent, it can be fun. Those moments reminded me of Saints Row 2 multiplayer (RIP). But the method to aquire clothing and guns is such a disgusting grind of blah. The car physics and driving camera are both awful to deal with. The guns are not balanced in the least. The power levels of players and matchmaking is not balanced in the least. Newbs can expect to be the whipping boy for anyone with a decent modded weapon, abilities, and upgrades. THose players get the same for killing a weak newbs as they do an equally matched player... so who do you think they go after all the time? No wonder the game died. There is zero evidence of any kind of non-cosmetic content since launch. The game allows rampant abuses, and creates them with a lack of proper matchmaking, leveled areas, or any mechanism to balance the game in any way.  Go play GTA5 multi... it's vastly superior. APB was an ok idea that set the bar really low for itself and didnt do anything to raise it. The game is still kind of active but new players were constantly being discouraged and leaving due to the buzzards who quite obviously flaunted their unfair advantages at every turn.  Oh wait... APB doesnt care. If you want to actually not get wrecked and not spend 6 months grinding incredibly stupid unlocks you give them money. It's free toplay. No surprises. But it's been out for 8 years. And the level of content available is so insanly limited... oh wait no there are a ton of clothing and ca options if you want to grind it out or pay up... but the gameplayu is still lame, shallow, and lacking any kind of meaningful substance. It blows.  So if you think it looks kind of fun, it can be for a little while until you see all the things that are wrong with it. Then you will wake up and say 'Why am I wasting my time with this when it's 2016 and there are vastly superior but similar experiences to have?'
2126	1	a	good game for fps players
5041	0	a	This game is extremley pay 2 win !
1796	1	a	I just came here to read the comments :o ***
10553	1	a	This was my first MMOFPS and i loved every second of it. A high recommendation for those who like large battles on moderately-large scales.
1501	1	a	I played APB Reloaded back during release for well over a year. I really enjoyed it. From making custom sprays for your vehicle right down to making new friends. The community was very enjoyable too! The amount of customization just keeps growing as time passes. The only negatives I can think of would be being able to perma buy guns but it has been a while since I played. Back before the current ranking system as well. Overall if you can find some buddies to play with it really ups the replayability of the game but it is always worth a few good laughs at any hour of the night.   Give it a try, you will enjoy it! 7/10 from myself.
5587	0	a	This game no idea what its trying to be
5874	0	a	At the beginning it is fun but after a few hours you start to meet alot of people who have payed for better items and are beating you only because they have better stuff.
3001	1	a	I find APB Reloaded to be pleasantly suprising. It is more variable and fuller little details than i anticipated. The intensive tempo of game is enough to keep you playing for quite some time. If I should find something negative to say about this game it would be its poor documentation and confusing tutorial.  Even with this limitation I can recommend this game to anyone interested of this type of online action games.
778	1	a	best multiplayer game I'v ever played. I recommaned It to all who love action filled multiplayer games:)
7326	0	a	its bad
10384	0	a	I honestly don't know how I feel about this game. My biggest problem with this game would have to go to how the map loads. I run on a decent laptop, and at the lowest settings, I get a constant 25-35 FPS. But occasionally, the game will become Microsoft Powerpoint, going to an astounding   1 FPS every five seconds for up to two minutes  . Aside from the horrid optomization, the textures could use a bit of work, to say the least. Even on high, textures are stretched to their limits to cover the large map. As well as that, there's no clear indication as to where a zone ends and another one begins besides a bit of text in the middle of the screen, and the variety is lacking in most respects. Off of the bad and onto the good, the game   is not   P2W. If it were, I wouldn't have 13+ hours in it. There is quite a bit of game to the game, and the purchases are   ONLY   meant for those who wish to support the team behind the game. I also love how this doesn't really even feel like a bulk-standard MMO with the TP/FP combat system. Though spells, called 'Mutations' here, are almost essentially useless, at least from what I've played up to level 7. If the devs put a bit more effort into the optomization and texture work in the game, that'd be nice. Just saying. I still do quite enjoy this game however, no matter how many times the framerate gets me killed because it had a presentation at work to do. I have no clue why, but the game is addicting, I will give it that. But please,   please   don't take mine or everybody elses' opinions on the game, try it for yourself. Depending on your tastes, you may or may not be surprised.   --- EDIT AS OF 6/23/15 ---   Heed thy warning, wary traveler, this game is dead. Dead in the sense that the devs themselves are neglecting it in it's entirety. I understand patches generally aren't a thing that can be pushed out very quick, unless they're small, but we haven't gotten a patch of substance for a LONG while. Long story short, the game isn't being actively fixed, the community is slowly declining, and the gameplay can be attrociously confusing. I do not reccomend unless you are dying to find an MMO in this vein. Even then, there are probably hundreds more of better quality out there.
10690	1	a	It is very fast paced and fun to run around. Shooting is great and requires anticipation and guessing of where the enemy will go. There are plenty of classes to suit what you need. It all works well.
7952	0	a	Its beyond boring. no point to it. i tried to play it a billion times and i hated it every time. not worth the free download and space. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.
4683	0	a	This game has a very interesting concept and could have easily been one of the best games out there, but that's not really the case since the whole game bases a lot around paying real life money to get a severe edge over your opponents unless they have also paid with their money, and if that is not the case. You will usually always be matched up against people that are at a much higher rating than yourself which makes it pretty unfair considering all the advantages they have.  This game is pretty much stupid and unbalanced right now, wouldn't really recommand this game before they have removed the 'P2W' aspect of the game.
2426	1	a	Great game &lt;3
6698	0	a	APB has a really good concept for a free2play game, but in my opinion it's more pay2win than anything else. If it goes the route that Path of Exile does it microtransactions, I'll gladly return. I shouldn't have to be forced to buy a weapon or anything that gives me gameplay advantages. I want to like APB, but it's the pay2win elements that is turning me off completely from the game.
4511	0	a	APB is Pay to win big time
8686	0	a	just going to say this right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing now, do not waiste your time downloading and playing this game, its worse than â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hitler
5774	0	a	A really stupid game with bad graphics, GTA III level bad, and you have to pay to even enjoy this game or else you just respawn... die and repeat  very infuriating, and very stupid people running it, the only good (and bad) thing about it is there is always new guns and stuff that's always better than what came before it, just to keep you buying more and more useless items with your hard earned money...   Oh yea, and don't glitch coz they ban you for that, and they see that it's not their job to fix it, it's your job not to exploit it... lol
1211	1	a	this game is bay 2 win fun 
8175	0	a	dont know if this game is good as the launcher wont work
1738	1	a	Best f2p game to play with friends
10036	1	a	Looks fun starting off, will see how the rest plays out.
1626	1	a	it ascn very nocie
2744	1	a	I writing a game review cause I have to. Game is good if you play it a lot. its hard to get enough coin to get any good gear
1005	1	a	it sucks
7255	0	a	Used to play this game back when RTW had it in BETA, Back then it was GREAT! Could of brought something special to the next generation games. But they flopped, and G1 Bought the game, and It has turned into a typical G1 Game.  Cheaters every mission, lack of massive development ( except for the cash shop ) and even a favourtisim from the developers to certain clans, due to them 'knowing' someone in that clan.  Would not recommend playing.  5/10 Because it WAS a good game.
4207	0	a	One of the worst games i have ever played, do not play this,
6350	0	a	Honostly I do not like this game, it is sure of an offbreed from the gta series, and the original arcade game of APB.
10089	1	a	I guess if I had to make it short and sweet it's like Fallout but with a much larger focus on crafting and multiplayer, so I suppose if you enjoy fallout you'll enjoy this
6174	0	a	Well, first of all... the game is great, the only problam is when I try to exit, and its a big problam. I have a computer with exactly the recommended system requierments but it still crashes... (blue screen /:)
976	1	a	GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game. Just jump in and play.  Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Replayability 14/15 Gameplay 12/15  Overall - 9/10
6379	0	a	pay to win  lots of tryhards unbalanced gameplay 
4557	0	a	This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.
8746	0	a	doesn't work, so i reccomend downloading it from the GamersFirst website.
9256	0	a	Dull system, dull quests, dull story, dull interface, dull graphics, dull sound... need I go on?
2618	1	a	i liked it just you have to buy weps with real money if you wanna keep them
9271	1	a	I've played Fallen Earth from 2012, and here's my Review and heres why most people don't know what there talking about when it comes to negative Reviews.  This game Defines Apocolyptic MMO RPGs as one of the greatest yet.  Here's why Players put all this foolish Negative Feed Back and Here's why:  Most new Players find it very difficult to play this game because it's not easy to play, It's challenging, most players want a simple and Easy MMO And if that's the case then this MMO RPG is NOT for you.  Alot of Players find it hard to gain chips, if your serouis about this game and actually take the time to explore the massive gameworld and see what's worth what, gaining chips is relativly easy easy for new players.  The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an MMORPG making it time consuming to figure out where to find certain matierals or if you have the chips just buy them off the auction if you have the chips to, and if there's any on the Auction. (Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)  PvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search. The thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.  Everythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.  Staff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @  Gamersfirst.com  rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.  Now my Plus's about the game:  The game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.  The game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed.  Again it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.  Overall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.  9/10 
1873	1	a	APB: Reloaded has one of the coolest premises ever. Cops and Crooks, simple right? It is.  OVERVIEW  The game takes place inb San Paro, a city with crime unparalel to anything else. So much so that the City Security Act (CSA) was passed. Allowing any citizen to walk the streets with a liscense to practice Vigilantism.    When you start the game you make your biggest decision, Do I want to be a good guy or a bad guy? Once you make your decision, you get to make a character with a very good, high detailed creator.   STARTING OUT   Once your character is situated, you're basically set free, the tutorial system is very poor. In the city you'll simply be dispatched to start or stop crimes. The game usually does a great job to match you with even teams.  CUSTOMIZATION   The game does although have great customization. Most clothes in the game are relatively cheap, so if you have the time, you can have an awesome character. Same with vehicles, customization is a big deal in this game.   The game allows you to create custom symbols as well. To paste onto your clothes and cars.  COMABT  There's lots of variables in combat. Combat can either be very fast and fun. or slow and boring. It all depends on the players, and enviroment.   The game kinda influences camping, with lots of defense objectives simply being, guard this choke point on this conveinient rooftop.  DRIVING   Ugh, driving is a mess. There's always a delay, you'll press 'd' to steer right. Then after half a second to three seconds later your character will steer the car. This cuases very awkward and slippery driving.  FINAL VERDICT   APB: Reloaded is a fun hectic expirience, especially with friends. But poor tutorials and slippery driving kind of ruin it.   ~ 7/10 Worth Trying.

8558	0	a	The developers should be ashamed of turning such a great game into the most notorious P2W garbage. They better upgrade the engine soon or I quit APB.
6938	0	a	bought a car in cash 20euro....the second day 40%sell......don't buy anything!
9532	1	a	Fallen Earth is pretty fun.. if you can get passed all the grinding. It's your typical MMORPG set in a post apocalyptic/fallout type of setting. This game is not pay to win, unless you want shortcuts in crafting or faster leveling.  Pros: - Crafting system - RPG style - Small and helpful community - Massive world - Variety of weapon types (Guns, Crossbows, Knives, Swords, Hammers, Etc.) - Variety of skills - Incorporates faction based quests and items - Holiday themed quests and items - Vehicles - Fast traveling - And so much more   Cons: - Combat system is a bit shabby - Leveling up is very slow - Hordes of monster everywhere you turn outside of the towns  Now i haven't played since October 2014, so i'll come back and update this review if neccassary.

1051	1	a	APB is a very fun to play game, you don't need to pay for anything to have loads of fun. Some features of the game include Cops and Robbers, Ram Raiding (by far the best), and freeroam. There is DLC to buy but i don't use it mainly because i don't want to buy it. This is my opinion of the game, and i hope you like it. Enjoy those RamRaids!!!
822	1	a	Action stuff there.
638	1	a	This game is as addicting as it is fun! whether you are a cop or a criminal you will never get bored. There are tons of weapons, vehicles, clothing options, and modifications! you can even create your own designs and make clothing or vehicles with it!!!! GET THIS GAME 10/10
8083	0	a	Terrible performance even on high end card and major lag makes it looks like a slide show

3256	1	a	Spawned in my friend Mr Super Swag Money picked me up in this grey van and we drove around the hole city in the van running into shops and stealing tv's. 9,5/10 pretty fun game.
899	1	a	Gets 50 fps on GTAV Gets 25 fps on Apb Reloaded gg good game 11/10 ign will buy again                                                                                         Ê³áµá¶«áµáµË¢áµ áµÊ°áµ á¶°áµÊ· áµá¶°áµá¶¦á¶°áµ áµá¶«Ê³áµáµáµÊ¸, áµá¶«á¶»
7014	0	a	So i hit play and all it does is takes me to their facebook page saying like me. HOW STUPID!
3293	1	a	This is a game of shooting, driving and sometimes getting angry.  It has a learning curve and sometimes will put you up against tough opposition which feels noticable but if you've played BF2 or similar multiplayer you'll spend the same amount of time getting killed before you get used to it.  The community is made of 'u mad bro' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ rejects and as such its best played with a few mates.  Customisation is massive and worth playing with. Spary your car. Dress and alter yourself and your clothes. You can also compose tunes to play when people die.  Worth trying, but worth knowing that it takes some time to get in to it.
6376	0	a	Pay to win, hackers.
1263	1	a	I will recommend to all my friends
3245	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.
8875	0	a	I used to play this game very frequently and would again if one could purchase crafting queue slots.  Since the addition of the patch 2.4 the style of gameplay has changed. Please be aware that this game is only marginally F2P like WoW, you need a subscription to properly play.  A year on from this review and my opinion has softened, but if you want to play this game without micromanagment and a large sink of your time it will be hard to do so without a subscription. Bearing this in mind, I wait with baited breath for an expansion good enough to lure me back in or some way to permanently expand my crafting ability.
7324	0	a	Doesen't load the Game 
3030	1	a	This is the best game on steam for free there are massive multiplayer and there are on your decision who you are Policeman?? Or gangster if you want game where you driving car in city and killing peopls this is must you chose
4626	0	a	â¢ Terrible Matchmaking â¢ Pay 2 Win  â¢ Lots of Hackers â¢ Long loading screens â¢ Requires days of grinding for barely good equipment. 
790	1	a	One of those games I download every year or so, play for 5 minutes, then delete again. I love it.
63	1	a	I got a 3 guns for spending $300 on the game.
5203	0	a	bad game and even worse anti cheat
33	1	a	Brilliant idea.... The game looks amazing, little unbalanced at some points, but it's still kinda amazing... graphics is very good for a f2p type and the gameplay too. Everything customizable from characters, clothes to cars. Nice team based actions.. It would be way better If most of the ppl are not kids and also there is some annoying cheaters, but the game is good.. Recommended to only Hardcore/pro players. 8/10
8399	0	a	I have over 3000 hours of gameplay in this and I can surely 'Not recommend' this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's unfair unless you are living next to the server with a macro mouse. The devs of this game are dumb and they don't care about server freezing and latency issues.
3624	1	a	I &lt;3 This G ame So much!! So much fun kind of like GTA V
554	1	a	Awsome cop and robber game! but the best part... make your own tattoes, put them on your body, buy a car, costumize it with your personal style! make your clothes the way you want it! make yourself, make a famous actor/ person you really like! there are really no limit!   PS: you might encounter hackers, atleast I did :( but its still worth it, just for the character costumazations!
4531	0	a	Cancer   Nah but foreels tho  This game is for a breed of serious gamers i will never fully understand, My best friend plays the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game. He admits its not the best game but he is so invested in it he cant stop playing #addictions
5398	0	a	If you spend enough money you can get guns that 1-3 hit kill where all non money purchaseable guns are balanced by themselves. It's Pay to Win, do not play unless you like that sort of thing

7372	0	a	worst game ever 0/10 would not furfunkle
6386	0	a	Worst GTAV-PayToWin-Copy ever made.  1. Joined. 2. Made a character that took about 15 minutes to make and spawned. 3. Missions... wait, where do i get them... 4. Ah ok, completes tutorial and some other â¥â¥â¥â¥. 5. Loses and wins sometimes, gets lvl3. 6. Can't find a shop. 7. Plays with a random team. 8. Fails. 9. Gets a new car that is totally civilian while i am a cop. Also gets a modification that automatically gets set on the old car. 10. Can't de-equip the modification to set it on the new car. 11. Can only find the 'pay with real money' shop but can't find the shop where i pay with in-game money. 12. Can't find the customization place. (the place where you're supposed to make an own logo/spray/clothes/cars) 13. Gets lags while i got about two times better specs than recommended. 14. Quits and tells myself 'what told me to try this?'. Oh right, it was supposed to be a fun openworld-copsandrobbers-shooting-thirdperson-robbing-patrolling-racing game.  + Great costumization. + Open-world. + Many weapons. + A good-looking loading screen.  - Can't access customization. - Can't really call this open-world because the world is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T. - To get a new weapon, you need to pay with real money. - If you want to buy a new weapon with in-game cash, it will be with a limited time. - Forever-loading loading-screen. - Completely NOT beginner-friendly. - A few minutes-startup. - Download to play, pay to win, don't pay to lose, lose to uninstall. - Only lvl50 players with shotgun that have 500 metres range. (this is total â¥â¥â¥â¥, a shotgun that shoots at this range!?) - You will regret downloading this. - It's total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, you won't like it. - After reading some posts, i understand that this game was 1000-billions-millions-thousands-houndreds-100 better before full release. - If you want to play something like GTA for free... just download GTAV cracked instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥, i promise it will be better to download 30-50GB and wait in forever than download this... how did i call it? Oh right, total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  [0.0000000P00P/10 Would try to forget about it instead of uninstalling it again.]
6279	0	a	When you uninstall just right!
2390	1	a	Very good, love the gameplay
351	1	a	come play that massive multiplayer online game with alot of jerks 
454	1	a	Great game
8047	0	a	My main game to play, loved the customization, but have to say that it is pay to win, also lot of hackers / cheaters , and nobody cares.. so i canÂ´t reccomend this game sorry
9711	0	a	This game is probably the WORST game I have ever played, I played DOTA and Clicker Heroes. So first of all let's recognize what is good in this game. The Storyline... That is literally it. Oh wait! There is... Nope, nothing. Nothing else at all. First of all, there is absolutely no fighting audio... Not even a gun sound or a cutting through the wind sound when you swing something... BUT there is a death audio. That doesn't even make sense actually, no fight audio BUT HEY LET'S MAKE A DEATH SOUND! Literally hated this game, especially since I spent about eight hours installing this game and then another hour and a half doing the wierd thing it does when you first start up. Oh and I forgot it DOES have two good things, it runs pretty well on my brothers crappy computer but the install took forever on my alienware.... I hate this game and I unistalled it as soon as I couldn't take it anymore.
5749	0	a	It's like GTA with micro transactions.
4569	0	a	BUGS OUT LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I CANT PLAY IT
5509	0	a	Three words. Pay 2 Win
8635	0	a	I have recently gotten back into this game, alot has changed but not all for the better.  Aside from its incredable redeeming characteristic in its diversity in customization, it is dificult to play with out getting upset, or feeling cheated. The weapon system, while reballanced slightly, remains unballanced and biased to paying players. There is still no way for a free player to obtain permanant weapons regardless of their playtime and support. Also, a word of warning for new players, G1 apears to be more concerned in making money than securing their game, paying into APB:R seems to justify players who use 3rd party programs (ie artificial aim) these players tend to have a higher concentration in the 'gold' rank.  While the world(s) are large, they lack the ability to captivate players. The only anarchic activity is played out by players, making the non-player enviroment feel boring and unrelated. Every citizen of the wold is weak and feble (killed by 1 shot from any weapon). Contact storys are boring and disregardable, and sometimes get in the way. In all the wold only feels like it was designed for PVP while i could have a more chaotic nature with a few AI alterations. If the wold felt more dangerous the storyline and premise would feel more believeable.  With the occasional trolling with cars and symbols this game, and the sparce pairing with decent  people, this game is worth playing, so long as you dont let the bull get to you. Please dont pay into G1 as it only encourages lazy developement and biased gameplay, generating a disturbingly Pay to Win enviroment that drives out good people.   This game is worth the play, if only an example to build off of and improve.  2 stars/5 and a comendation for updating glitches and issues that broke the game.
96	1	a	if you play with friends it is very good game
6073	0	a	Poor optimization
1548	1	a	This game is for those that don't have the money to get GTA. It's mostly P2W as most cool features are for members only, but if u can deal with that then the game isn't all that bad.
8923	0	a	*Launches game* *Talks to man* *Man gives me a mission* *Walls dissapear* *Falls through ground* *Game crashes *Game reopens itself* 'Would you like to exit to desktop?' 'No' *attempts to kill first enemy* *dies* *game crashes*
7862	0	a	I played this game before it's official relaunch. However back then the game could barely run on any systems. Now after playing it on the relaunch only makes this title no justice. As it's full of cheaters and hackers with aimbot and wallhack. The game itself has awsome graphics for it's time and nice visuals. Somewhat large ``worldsÂ´Â´ to raom in tho they are 2 diffrent parts of the city of San Paro. But as said the game is now full of cheaters and hackers making this titel nothing worth playing.

2852	1	a	This game is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING BUT STILL FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
5624	0	a	You can feel the pay2win at the start, when expecially when you are a new player and you have a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ weapon and you must compete against other players that spent more time on this game, and have all RPG'S, Grenade launcher and OP weapons. Plus it's full of weeaboos and nerds, another reason for uninstall this game.
8151	0	a	Game controls are Saints Row II awkward, and community is full of bitter people. Not trolls trying to be funny, just bitter people.
9481	1	a	There is a lot wrong with it. Enemy AI is terrible. The faction system, what was once its greatest strength, has been neutered into non-existence. But if you like crafting, like the open post apocolypse world, like the idea of a genuine RPG FPS MMO without tab-targeting, this could be for you. And it is FTP, so you have nothing to loose in trying it!   (The only real limitation on FTP accounts being crafting is slower and you may only craft one thing at a time).
8705	0	a	An awesome game , ruined by his publisher. Try it just for fun , if u wanna win , you will have to pay.

1508	1	a	Super game. been hacking since day one.   Fun to hear kids cry.  Helios hack FTW !!!
5205	0	a	I interest for this game charactermaker:),but this game is pay to win:(
9833	0	a	Didn't care for the early game mechanics.  I feel other games can offer better packages of this theme.
768	1	a	in general this game is loads of fun, i love all the originality this games has from the customization to the the arsinal of guns you can use. the only complaint i have is the server lag, wich at times can be unplayable.
9202	0	a	this game has machanics for boath first and third person playstyle's and implements them and manny other game machanics horrobly. plus you'll be lucky if the game works more than once on you computer before it bugs out never to run again
8900	1	a	Amazing for a f2p game, the feeling of getting your first actual gun is like getting your first helmet in WoW back in vanilla. The mount system isn't perfect, but is deffinately above par. The crafting system is actually really fun to grind for, and the actual explorable world is massive, none of it feels like blank space inbetween more detailed areas. PvP sounds like it would be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ show, but is actually fairly balanced. Auction house system is deffinately well thought through. Although there are immense amounts of weapons, none of them feel useless or like filler. Quests are actually fun and have some difficulty. There is always someone friendly at the beginner town who would gladly accept help or offer it themselves. Combat is okay, nothing to write home about.
8715	0	a	I'll be honest, it was very fun at first. The physics for cars, looting, riding aroudn with a friend able to shoot at the cops in the passenger seat... playing your own music in the car(that no one else can hear but you apparently). It has good customization, a bit pricey for good stuff but managable... guns and etc aren't pay 2 win to my knowledge but overall this game was a handful. It's buggy, load screens are rediculously long, there's hardly anyone ever on, the policemen side has WAY too much power in their hands to stop the criminals. Hell, accidentally bumping into something with your car gives you a split second of warning that you could be captured and disabled by a policeman... lucky me, once a policeman sees you... They just stalk you to the ends of the earth(sounds realistic lol) because there's no one else online. The pvp got to bed fun but it overall felt like the game was too dead, too unbalanced, and buggy as hell. This is a potentially nice game but it's just another one of those 'never heard of it' mmo's that vanishes off to the side. I enjoyed the little time I played it, but I can't say it was the best experience for me to recommend to another person.
3976	0	a	The concept of this game is really cool. Its kinda like a GTA online shooter, its completly open world and the customization possibilities are HUGE! You can literally create everything for your character!   A big downside of this game is the ingame shop. Im playing at gold rank without any premium stuff and weapons and 90% of my opponents are just people with premium to get more money and Golden Weapons with max Upgrades from the store. Not having these can make the game very frustrating since your opponents will just be stronger in any way without much skill. They reg Health faster, their weapons deal more dmg, their accuracy is higher. For example there is a premium SHOTGUN, that hits you for almost full dmg without being in melee combat, which is highly frustrating to play against. This is just an example.   The principle of the game is still fun, but the P2W model ruins it a lot in my opinion.
10447	0	a	This game is so lagging i cant play it. It just crashes everytime i walk. Game gods FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
7558	0	a	Basically, if GTA was an mmo and was pretty dull and just generally boring with near nothing to do and pay-to-win weapons.
5425	0	a	Unique game and playstyle, weapons are great, systems and everything about this game is amazing in it's own right, including the asylum and baylift, especially the clothes, vehicle, character, etc customization. Although many problems do exist with this game such as including the matchmaking system. One other problem although I know of this game is that steam registers it as open even when it has been fully closed for hours, unallowing you to close steam without the task manager. All in all though it is a great game besides some capatability bugs with steam. You got glitched galore in the maps and everywhere else. This game when you look for problems, you find them. You have kids with rocket launchers surfing card and firing away at you. Missions are onesided and heres the big one.....ANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN A GARBAGE TRUCK CAN RUN OVER YOUR CAR, CARS AROUND YOU AND EVERYTHIGN ELSE RAMMING IT AND DESTROYING IT ALL OUTSIDE OF ANY MISSION SO YOU CAN NOT HARD THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.....and it's quite annoying I do say.... also you need 400+ hours in the game to even have a chance at taking on veteran players who log hours. combat is screwed up with hit registers due to when you shoot depends on when the server is pinging, everything having a small noticable delay
3526	1	a	I really wish this game was controller compatible.
9720	0	a	Laggy pice of â¥â¥â¥â¥, had this game before worked great, now no updates....laggy as hell cant even aim or move without laaaaaaaaagggg
8985	1	a	One of the Better F2p games.  It does have some Pay to win aspects in its cash shop, but dont let that detrack from the really Enjoyable game play, Gritty atmosphere, and the best crafting system in any game, All hidden inside this indi gem.  Till Fallout online hits, this is the best post apocolyptic game on the market!  7/10
7382	0	a	i cant even play this game my server doesnt work
4648	0	a	Like every 'Free to Play' Game out there, today. You get a bunch of fedora sporting, neckbearded fat â¥â¥â¥â¥s and spoiled kids spending their mommy's money or their benefits checks on overpowered â¥â¥â¥â¥ for their characters. Just as soon as you start playing, you're constantly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in every direction by unbalanced weapons and rockets and all you get is a two inch â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a weapon that does nothing. The cars control like you're on ice, even when those cars look like they're your typical front-wheel drive rice burner from Fast and the Furious or an All Wheel Drive supercar. If you want a game that you can play for free, don't waste your time and save your money on a better game. Seeing games like this is no wonder that they get bombarded by hackers and trainers.
925	1	a	APB, Played it for so much that I have have been so attached to it. I recomend it for anyone who likes GTA Type games
10130	0	a	During my short time with Fallen Earth, I don't think there was a moment where I wasn't bored. One way of putting it is 'the game has a steep learning curve', but in reality that just means it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and convoluted mechanics elsewhere. Bad, even for an MMO.
564	1	a	Rage PB anyone?
4825	0	a	For the love of god don't play this game and definetly don't buy anything in this game. This game is so p2w that i can't describe it,it's a cancer that's milking money from the victims. So i beg you to not play it as it doesn't deserve to be played. You'll just end up rage quiting one way or another.
8349	0	a	not good at all
10041	1	a	awsome game i love gomes that your free too explore the world and the quests are nice i dont see anything bad with this game other then the garphics i mean they are good but ive seen better but still an amzing very nice and fun game to play
952	1	a	This game is like Yoyaz's house.Dark and full of wierd smells.
3689	1	a	After a few hours it will be boring
10044	1	a	Buggy as hell, AI is utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't expect any patches. Only real reason to play this game is for its uniqueness: An MMORPG with Third-person shooter mechanics, and a decent salvage based crafting system.
1475	1	a	APB Reloaded. You could compare it too Grand Theft Auto online. There are 2 groups, Enforcers and Criminals. They both have their strong and weak points. Personally I find Enforcers easier to level up, but Criminals are easier to get money with. You can buy weapons, clothes, songs (for your player) and cars. All of those are also completely customizable! Just a car with 1 color? Fine! A car with 5 colors and 20 cool art things on it? Fine! Everything is possible. You can even design your own logo's, which is awesome! Everyone does that and you can see a lot of creative people. There are some logo's that are intimidating, but you'll just have to deal with it.  There is an option to buy items with in-game money or with real money, via the store. Both are great ways to get better items.  Most of the features in the game are good, still there are some bad ones. There are for example quite some hackers, really frustrating and the staff doesn't do anything about that, or at least, not much. There are also some really overpowered weapons, like the OSMAW, a Rocketlauncher that kind of insta-kills you, really no-skilled. Luckily it's a main weapon, so you will have to exchange it for an assault rifle and the launcher is empty quick.  Missions are fun, randomly getting people from the other faction against you. It's actually a simple attack/defend mission, most of the time. Sometimes there are 'capture the flag'-missions, 'dominion'-missions and simple 'team-deathmatch'-missions. Sometimes the matchmaking isn't as equal is people would like to though.  I recommend everyone to play it. It is awesome, fun and challenging. Beware, you do need a computer with some good hardware, if you do not have that, you will have problems running it. Just install the game on Steam, it's free-to-play and the game isn't that big to download. If you like shooters, racing and an open-world game, this is for you.   Rating: 7.5/10 Not a 7, because that's too low, not an 8 because it's not good enough for that. Still worth a try
3421	1	a	A game of 'cops and robbers.' While the robber's have it easy, they can earn money by robbing, and cop 'must' earn money by 'taking' a robber's 'stolen' money and by missions. The game can provide entertianment, but does tend to get 'old' after a while.  -dark  *This is my review but the best way to find out if you like it is to play it.
1372	1	a	it's fun try itr out
10490	1	a	was one of the best MMO's out then the Devs gave up banned half the players GG game
406	1	a	APB Reloaded features a Grand Theft Auto style gameplay, but the description doesn't lie when it says HUGE customization! I have played this game for a while now and have noticed a few features this game has that weren't mentioned:  1) the symbol editor, it's a Black Ops type symbol creator from what I can tell. 25 shape limit for free players but I was able to make Lagann with it so it's not too bad. 2) there is a neat voice chat feature that has an area effect, this means that people can hear you better in the voice chat from closer up so it can make for some funny scenes! 3) work with either faction! I know that's obvious but I wanted to say either side you choose is fine! Make your decision on what missions you would rather do. What I can tell is that the clothing can be made from either faction. 4) when buying clothes, just go for what shape you want because you can edit anything as long as it isn't the stuff you have equipped when you start. Last but not least, check you email when you make an account because you might get some cool deals sent to your inbox! Heck, my characters in it are proof that as long as some one is human, they can be made in APB!
2359	1	a	Quite fun, especially if you play with a friend.
7425	0	a	I dont have that many hours put into APB when I wrote this review. But from the time I've played APB at the lowest graphic settings and with 20 FPS I currently think its a decent game. It IS ONE OF THE FEW games that allow you to customize the absolute hell out of you and your cars. The combat system is OK, although infinite stamina isnt that realistic. 'Headshots' do the same damage on your head and your foot, which disables headshot instakills, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Now about the buying system in APB. You buy a guy in the game, a decent gun. Do you have it? Yes, for 10 days. ARMAS marktplace, you can buy quite a lot of decent and nice stuff. Like nice packs which can include clothes, weapons, attachments, modifications, vehicles and emotes. BUT the best guns in the game you HAVE to buy with REAL money. Which makes this game lean even more to a P2W. Now if they were to put the best guns and every gun in the in-game shop which you buy with your well earned in-game money AND make them last FOREVER and not for only 10 days. I mean, you dont buy a car IRL to drive 10 days with it and then bring it back to the car dealer, do you? You dont go to the mall to buy some bread, eat it, then crap it out and then bring it back to the mall, do you?  I would give this game a rating of 6.5/10. It has amazing customization, an interesting server setup and a free-roam to mission 'map' but the developers are greedy, very very very very greedy. They want you to BUY somewhat EVERYTHING in the game to keep it FOREVER. Thats not how it works. Not at all.
6516	0	a	Heyyo, DON'T GET THIS GAME. They ruined it. Bunny-hopping-galore even with sniper rifles it works perfectly. NTEC is useless compared to Joker and it's brutal how much Gamersfirst ruined this game compared to how they first started off in APB R beta when they balanced LTL weapons... now every gun is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. RIP APB.. maybe you should've just stayed dead. :(
10390	0	a	- Development start date: 2006 Reloaded Studios. - Original release date: September 22, 2009 by Icarus Studios/Reloaded Studios. - Acquired by GamersFirst/Reloaded Studios June 15, 2011.  Pros: - Neat vehicles and pretty decent game mechanics.  Cons: - Content updates minimal since its release (patches somewhat regular but mostly just tweaks). - Outside game wiki nearly mandatory to make any progress.  I spent 2 months as a premium member for bonuses to crafting and leveling. But unfortunately I felt that decent game mechanics where hindered by incomplete or sparse content. Overall the game seemed very empty and bare boned. Monsters, weapons and gear felt repetitive and minimal. The original development team left many unfulfilled promises before abandoning this game to 'GamersFirst'. Last I played, a small community of players were still around and a GM or 2 were somewhat active.  As a fan of the post-apocalyptic theme and MMOs this game was a giant tease that left me wishing for more content and optimization. Stuff that simply never came.
10476	1	a	Ok so, where do I start? This game was a game I was very fond of (As my time spent playing it might show) and I've already written a review before but since it was kinda choppy I stepped upon it again and decided to add to it.  I've been playing this game for around 4 years back when I started around 2012 when I was also first introduced to steam, so along with downloading TF2 this game caught my eye as my love of post-apoc settings for games sparked my intrigue. Back then, this game just had so much to offer, to me in particular as I was fine with discovering most of it for myself with managing to obtain an ATV early on.   In terms of gameplay, the whole grinding aspect didn't really bother much as I was still managing to have fun cooperating with various people I would meet around placed like Embry (I think that was the name of the main S1 city?) and City where there was an event to protect a town made up by players from enemy mobs (Called Shivas If I'm correct) where you would see people showing off their cool gear and mounts.  The PvP aspect of the game was never really anything I tapped into, It just didnt really intrest me, but I'm sure theres some players out their who saw its potential.  To end this review of, no matter how bad it is, I guess this game is kinda dead with its peak being off in the earlier years where I made a few friends on my way to Lvl 55.  If anyone remembers me, my main characters name was Brad Carson, with other names like Pvt.Brad being another char of my mine, and to anyone who remembered me, It was a pleasure having played a fun game with you for quite a few years.   Sorry if this review was pretty bad, I'm just really getting over a lot.
2171	1	a	This game is like a really bad cigarette; Really expensive and you know it's terrible but it is so addicting you just can't stop. Playing with friends I recommend, don't expect it to be easy either. Raging will be involved, but it only makes you want to get better.
395	1	a	This game is for the budding artists and kind of people who want to feel good about dominating other people.
520	1	a	Good TPS!  You can drive, shoot. Pure PvP! (I'm an idiot! xD ) It has a lot of guns, even a social map (it's rare to see that in a shooter game).  The best: Customization. You can even draw things on your clothes! *-* &lt;3  The worst: Cash guns with time limit. I hate when devs put those things! -.-'
6030	0	a	played it 200+ hours and 2013~2015  not changed anything about balance and hackers  -10/10 worth play it
5366	0	a	this game is ballshit  
8085	0	a	Literally the worst 'game' on steam. -58790823450924385743705/10 rating.
1104	1	a	Pretty fun game to pass the time with, but need to play with friends, not a solo game :D
10448	1	a	amazing i love it but everytime i go to change the graphics and restart i goes all grey and i cant play
9388	1	a	If you like to play fallout this is the game like fallout but as in a MMO.
5397	0	a	A really awesome concept, but just done really bad. Its still fun to play, but if you want to do actual missions and stuff then you will have to atleast pay a dollar to get a gun that DOESN'T to the equivalent damage of shooting paper clips covered in feathers at people.  However, I will say that the overall customization of everything is the best I have seen in a LONG time.
8620	0	a	run while you still can
6225	0	a	1 word. No its 3 words i think  PAY TO WIN
4385	0	a	Came back to this game for the third time and its still the only game i most disrecommend , hey devs how about you use this game to wipe your asses when you finish polishing it which is never going to happen.
270	1	a	This game is great i love it &gt;D
2456	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
10567	1	a	I'm writing this fast review after playing the game more than 300 hours .  + Competitve game you can easily tell the difference between good and noob player . + fast / smooth and balanced gameplay specially the fly and Ski. + more than 8 class . + very good map designing . + require highly team work . + very good voice chat command . + dedicated servers . + almost no lucky kills in the game you better be good or die . + no camping behind doors or corners or cheap kills you will have to go out and face your opponent . - only 3 active game modes .  My personal rating   9.5/10  The best MultiPlayer Game of the generation .
1244	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
6727	0	a	When I played it, I noticed it got more to the point where it was harder to play because only the older players or more experienced players still played it. Its cool and a bit fun but it got to me when I was being matched rarely against players the same level. 5/10
2926	1	a	Doesnt Support dual screens, so i had to disable a screen to play it, throws you into a game with no information on what you have to do or when or how. all the quests are as followed, go to point Hold the F key. Pick up thing with the F key drive back to start point. get reward. Driving is terrible cars handle like they are on ice every mechanic in the game is clunky and un refined to the point of it being unusable. Quests that use PVP are simply defend point or capture point while killing people that respawn over and over for 10 minutes. when u die ull respawn about a half minute walk away from the action. youll die in 2 hits, they will die in about 2 Clips. no exceptions. camera sways from side to side like your drunk in gta4 with roman. everything about this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. a person i know just said that you have to get used to it, but id rather not lower my standerds of play. The only people that play this are the sad people that cant justify paying for it before it was f2p

2636	1	a	look stupid and shoot guns
2131	1	a	wish this game didnt have as many hackers as it does. i really loved this game for a long time but it just got way too out of hand.
2427	1	a	this game is great. Its like an online GTA. Its free aswell so its even better. Play as cop or criminal and roam the streets doing missions and killing eachother
2673	1	a	APB:R - What can i say? 1: It's the best game i've ever played. 2: It's the worst game i've ever played.  The good:  - First its a fun F2P game.  - Once you get use to the driving in the game cars can be really fun and you and your friends can setup waypoints around the map and race. - The game stops most hacks. Though the game still can't seem to stop some aimbots and macro's. Many cheats in other games on offer are simply not on offer because the servers are hosted by GamersFirst. This means no annoying speed hacks/GodMode/Etc. - No other game can offer you this much customization. You can make your charatcer look like anything you can think of. From 'Ronald Macdonald' to the 'Joker (Batman)' Any of this is possible. You can customize your cars and even make some crazy tattos. - The game unlike Call Of Duty. Requires a lot of teamwork. So i strongly advise grouping up with some friends. You can all work together using different guns so you run up to a enemy with a Shotgun whilst your teammate covers you from a far with a sniper.  The bad: - I have simply never played a game what is so demanding. By far it isn't the best looking game but you can play Battlefield 3 or Skyrim on High FPS but You probably won't be able to play APB at 60FPS without it dropping to 40 or less. - The servers. They suck. Thats all i can say. - Like many F2P there is some P2W in it. If you want to invest a little real money in APB it costs a lot just to get a perm gun for your account ($30+). The guns aren't really P2W. Most of them are just reskins of guns you can unlock in game without paying real money. - This game isn't Noob friendly. Many new players join expecting to play another noob. Well guess what its a either a pro whos created a new account or a decent player who has decided to dethreat so they can stomp on the poor noobs. - They constantly bring new things out. What pretty much always cost you real money.  Conclusion: Get the game its free try it out. When you first get it you probably will get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked all the time. Just chill and carry on playing. When you hit around 50hours playtime you'll be a good driver. Have some cool stuff unlocked and will be winning a few mission =)  Rating 7.5/10

3077	1	a	i love this game
7124	0	a	Got banned from the game for no reason. 10/10 Would make new account.
3746	0	a	After clocking over 1000 hours on this game (300+ before steam merge) playing since 2012, i have remained a faithful customer through thick and thin, even spent a total of $560 USD ($768 AUD) on in game items like cars , clothes guns... even got a nice collection of legendaries but up untill a few days ago when i couldnt log into my account due to it being BLOCKED?  After contacting Gamersfirst regarding the issue, they palmed me off to Punkbuster who informed me i have a global ban due to cheating...(WTF!!??), they informed me there is no way to tell how or who but all they know is there was an interference with punkbuster so they refuse to lift the ban because they said it might happen again, so i sent another ticket pleading my case and what was happening at time of block(which was closing apb with task manager due to game crash) and they just deleted without even reading  Today i have recieved an email from gamersfirst saying my account is cancelled and pretty much 'smell ya later'  VERDICT: Dont give these guys a cent and dont ever think they care about their customers because they clearly dont. i've always encounterd hackers in this game and always annoyed me, but being banned for hacking when you werent is absolutely disgusting.

8787	0	a	It's been trying to launch for 40 minutes now and I'm still looking at my desktop background
8619	0	a	Was fun at first. Got pretty old quick. People paying for guns definitely have an unfair advantage over those who don't. And the guns are rented or you have to give up your first born child to perm unlock.
3427	1	a	I've had a case of hemeroids that was more fun than this game.
4945	0	a	I don't know, but just on this game I get crashes (0xc000007b). ;/ I have tried many things but no one helps... *sadlife*
2195	1	a	Fun game- Well worth playing and spending many hours wit.
627	1	a	puts a fun creative spin on cops and robbers with the adition of guns,cars and hole lot of customization toping it of with the fact  its massmultiplayer and free roam U CAN BE CRIMANLES AND KILL TINGS CAUSE U KNOW THATS WHAT CRIMS DO
10524	1	a	I absolutely loved this game before the patch, the patch makes everything more confusing. I get what you tried to do Hi-Rez but you honesly lost me as a player with the patch. The bullet timings are improved in the patch and theres a lot more balanced weapons now. Rather than patch the game after 2 years and completely mess it up, shouldn't you have just made a new game? It's about that time after all.   If you liked tribes before you will still enjoy this fast paced shooter but to those that grew fond of the elements first presented in tribes ascend, this game will now just irritate you as nothing is even close to what it used to be. GG Hi-Rez, you lost me as a regular player with over 800 hours.   The patch might just take some getting used to and I'm just salty cause it's not what I've wasted a lot of time and a few dollars on, but so far I am not impressed by what I see other than bullet speed improvements. Players get too many guns to the point where the classes are rendered useless and you can have a heavy armor with snipers and never know. It adds a whole new element to the game which is nice, but overall its just $hit in my opinion as of right now.   I would still recommend it as there is still no other game out there like this, and being free to play it'd be dumb not to atleast try it.
9728	0	a	10/10 if you wanna meet hitler and attract Aids x Cancer. Otherwise if your smart you will get the achievement for uninstalling.
8704	0	a	The driving mechanic doe and the in-game perchase neh i rather buy gta v then the in-game perchase
4174	0	a	The game can be quite fun and more or less fair (even without paying any money), but I ran into the following problem:  After installing and starting it up I suddenly got a Punkbuster permanent ban after about 15 minutes of playing. I didn't cheat, I don't even have cheat related software on my computer (I know, you don't believe me and that's okay, but I'm speaking the truth here). The support won't do a thing about it (just sending pregenerated messages) and Punkbuster only tells you that someone else may have hacked my account and cheated.. which I don't believe.  I then made another account on my Laptop and have played for hours there without getting a ban. Now I'm afraid to spend any kind of money on this game if I'll just get banned again without even getting a proper reason.  So watch out if you do intend to spend time and money in this game, I still don't know why Punkbuster issued a ban on me. It could either have been Nvidia Shadowplay (with the FPS overlay) or Borderless Gaming (which I didn't use for this game) or AutoHotKey (Which I use for my keyboard layout and have never had a problem in any other game yet). I heard there are ways to cheat with AutoHotKey, but I never touched any of those scripts.  So believe me or not, but I was a legitimate player and received a permanent ban after 15 minutes of playing. Support won't help a bit and Punkbuster won't tell me why they banned me, so I'll probably never find out what happened.
10279	0	a	I was really looking forward to this game, until I had to 'sign up' and then wait for an email that never came. I can't recommend a game i literally can't play.

5423	0	a	I was banned from this game a couple years ago for hacking. They put my username on a board of shame and everything. I forgot about it, but then a couple days ago, the people who run this game saw fit to remind me about the incident. They sent me an email saying they know I hacked, but that their willing to give me a second chance. Well guess what, I know I didn't hack, it was just your anti-cheat software banning me for a false positive detection. Here's hoping you've fixed that in the years since, and that you can convince people to try your game after they read reviews like this. I won't be giving you the second chance.

I could not figure out what was going on throughout the entirety of my playtime.

4255	0	a	it needs more stuff for the free to play players
2067	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
9071	1	a	This game is not bad bad by any means, but it's not Fallout. If you found this and are hoping for a Fallout-MMO, then you'd be sadly mistaken. I haven't spent much time on this game, mainly because it's a bit tedious to actually get started playing it. If you have some free time, and you're looking for a new game to try out then go ahead and download this one. I feel that once you start progressing into the game, it just continues to get better and better as you go. I give Fallen Earth a 7/10.
375	1	a	Its OK
2068	1	a	i like this game nice to play you get lost in it 8 out of 10
9359	0	a	i cant even play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game because when i signed up for the login stuff in the game launcher it didnt even et crreate a username WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2284	1	a	Probaby one of the funniest new games ive tried. Really has a endless amount of stuff to do and enjoy in this game. Have yet to get bored of it and I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good FPS
5080	0	a	This game is jackshit. It is literally impossible to play, there are no instructions on where to go, I was lost like an asian kid at the Supermarket. Like oh my god, I didn't even know how to put on clothes. Apparently there are 2 sides. Cops, and criminals. I chose the Cops first because I was curious. I spent about 45 minutes in the beginning tutorial, because they didn't say anything about going to your inventory. I quit on that side, and I went to the criminals side. Even more confusing, as confusing as a Rubik's Cube made By Stephen Hawking with the Theory of Relativity. I just started the tutorial and they just go, 'well, do this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play.' And they don't give actual instructions. I just spawned a tiny little smart car and started driving around in the City crashing into other players. This game is a pile of donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't even think about getting it. This is basically GTA's little autistic midget albino baby who is blind.  My friend recommended this game to me. We're actually not friends anymore.
6870	0	a	BEWARE!  I played this game for about 2 weeks, I even bought into this game, and the item shop. (Yes, it is pay to win)  However I was banned under the PunkBuster system it was then using. It now uses FairFight, but I don't know if that will make much of a difference. My experience with the Customer Service was atrocious. First they told me I was banned because I was 'observed cheating' then later told I was never observed, but rather it was a PunkBuster ban. Their recommended appeal process was to follow up with PunkBuster. When following up with PunkBuster they could not produce a 'report'. I also played many other games that at the time were using PunkBuster and did not produce any bans on any of these other games.   As mentioned in other reviews, I believe this is because there is a very active and corrupt team running this game. The slightest bit of e-sluethery will net you many posts regarding these accusations. The community is dying slowly from this and it is quite sad. Because the game itself is actually quite entertaining and a decent time sink if it weren't for such poor mismanagement from day 1 through now.

2642	1	a	A good MMO to pass the time with....
10169	1	a	Great MMO,but graphics are kinda crappy
6165	0	a	This game is way too confusing. The hud is useless and overpacked. The maps are really small when compared to gta and such like. The posse system is really stupid and the fact that you cannot spot crimes in progress sucks. (There is a button to press like f4 or something, but that is glitched to â¥â¥â¥â¥). What else... Oh yeah, the community can be unfriendly. Thats the kicker. So I cannot say this game is fun, or I would be lying. Play something else, don't spend money on this game.
3028	1	a	the first game to come to mind when play ABP is gta5 online with the cosrimization of everything
321	1	a	the developers are awful and the game is in a state of never-ending decay.

9130	0	a	too much lagg and it take at least 2 and a half hours to download if lucky plus another 3 to get the updates required than every once in a while while its updating itll crash so all and all this game is a P.O.S!!!!!!!! &gt;:( waste of space and i could've been playing 3 other games that r better and dont take as long to download whoever invented this game needs to fix the bugs and stop doing a P.O.S job on games like this all I have to say is you are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lucky this didnt cost money of so help me god, well hopefully you got fired for making this P.O.S!!! thanks for wasting my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day waiting for this garbage
6094	0	a	game is too bad to play......developers need to put some more efforts in it  concept of the game is nice but execution was poor
4811	0	a	THis game be good but I is laggin. Make a australian server. Also there be too much hackers and aimbotters. Find a way to ban them nasty â¥â¥â¥ mofos!
3297	1	a	wher do you find the grage 
4246	0	a	Used to be a good game, back in about 2011, in my opinion ofcourse. Stay far far away now. R.I.P APB Reloaded.
3234	1	a	Despite the AWFUL AWFUL start out and cruelty towards newbies, but once you force yourself through a veritable HELL in the game it eventually calls to you in a way that says 'play me some more, play me some more, you will like it once you play it long enough' which seems to be the case for me, but the lag spikes are kinda irritating and if you have a really under performing NON-gaming computer, you'll have a HELL of a time trying to play this game!
6238	0	a	Well,i dont recommend it for laptops because it froze when i tried to load it.
10073	1	a	p2p days will be forever missed..

7801	0	a	I managed to get a few hours playing this game, and what I found out to my content, was very sad. This game was very fun in the beggining, it had nice graphics, the game play was fun, and I thought it was going to be a very fun and good game. A few more hours of gaming and I learned that the only way to actually get anything is with real money, THIS IS A PAY-TO-WIN GAME, what pay-to-win generally means is that the only way to get stuff or be good in the game is to buy stuff with real money. After I kept playing I saw that the community was complete trash, too. As well as the greedy producers of this game. I do not recommend this game for any reason, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money playing the game and googling things because no one is opt to help you.
4923	0	a	this game is really fun and all but it is a pane in the butt because when you try to run it it going to scew up so no i don't recemend it
257	1	a	Not bad, have to have a pretty good pc to play it though!
10285	1	a	This games is a little hard to describe without saying the phrases 'Fallout 3', 'New Vegas', 'MMORPG', or 'Son of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I can holster HOW many weapons!?'   It certainly wasn't the game I was expecting, but it is the game I've been looking for, in a way. It's a perfectly/near-perfectly executed post-apocalypse MMORPG, and that's a rarity. My only complaints are that I found it looking for something else entirely, and that the story at the beginning reminds me of the early 90's Apoc D&amp;D settings. Otherwise, it gives you a horse two minutes in, something most MMORPGs take you days to get, and then they're usually expensive and just sort of bleh. In this case, I was just given a free horse, and it felt like it actually made sense. You're in a desert wasteland. Here, the one thing you need the most, in a desert wasteland.   And you can holster six weapons at once. I have a fireaxe, a rifle, two knives, and two pistols. I look like some sort of crazy gunslinger, and I'm not even an hour into the game!   Overall, as first impressions go, unless this game just suddenly becomes awful, this is probably the best MMORPG I've seen in years.
6947	0	a	Hold it! Stop right there, No gamers beyond this point! !!!!!!!!  No use playing: High ranking players stalk the low level distracts and will keep you from getting any actual experience. In short - you're screwed if you're not cheating.  Did I mention it takes a half an hour to load?

3833	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the customization, which is grossly limited to free-to-play. That being said, the game play is ridiculously repetitive and unbalanced. Aimbot users are rampant with no ingame way to report offenders. The community is full of nothing but adolescent morons that makes âBarrens Chatâ seem like Shakespeare. I really wanted to get behind this game and even spend some money on it because it is a great concept, but after seeing that this game is just as bad (if not worse) as it was 2 years ago, I can tell that G1 is not serious about developing a decent game.

Its just a gta ripoff with bad graphics poor driving mechanics buggy af takes too long to load. its pretty fun for the first 10 minutes but just gets repetitive and boring. overly complicated and just glitchy. if you want to try a free poorly made version of gta san andreas then this is the game for you

7121	0	a	All Pounds Spent is a very good game when u have 420$ worth weapons.
4969	0	a	Pay to win through and through. Very sad, this game had a lot of potential and the customization is very good if they would've just made a base price of $30-$40 and had weapon unlocks similar to GTA this game would've been amazing. But no F2P system ruins another game.
6979	0	a	I do not recommend this game 100%. It is 'Pay to Win' meaning you have to pay real money for the best gear or you will never win like you should be. And even when you do buy something, it gives you a 30 day time period then you have to buy it again. It is infested with hackers which really downgrades the quality of the gameplay, I would just wait for the game to come out on Console 'Xbox One &amp; PS4' which is scedualed to hit the consoles in August of this year but we are still waiting word from game devs.  In conclusion, I recommend this game about 45%  This is not how a MMO should be.
7498	0	a	Populated with 12 year olds and pay to win. Don't even bother.
7942	0	a	I love this game to bits, it's just soo buggy....
7275	0	a	well all i have to say about this game is that its completely bull crap because every time u try to log in with your email and password it always gives that error 11386 or something like that and u try looking it up on youtube or something to tell u how to fix it we follow the directions and it still doesnt work and its annoying u cant really enjoy this game when u cant even GET PASS THE FREAKING SIGN IN AND ITS FREAKING ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i highly not recommend this game
5005	0	a	I have played this game before it it was on Steam.   THIS IS A PAY TO WIN GAME.
421	1	a	I would have to say, deffinatly worth its price. unlike some other free games like warframe, its not nessicarily a buy to win game. and if u do buy, its a helluva lot more fun but whatever u do, buy this game! it's really great game, fun to play with friends, good gameplay but there are some minor tweaks like how many trillions of bullets it takes to kill, thats annoying but besides that its pretty fun. so if u don't have enough to buy GTA5 this is the next best thing so friend me if u want to play!
4581	0	a	this game is stupid
8245	0	a	One of the best games I ever played but G1 goes hand in hand with the cheaters and alot of the cheaters are from the bigger clans and are friends with moderators etc so they wont get banned. I got banned for abusive language for life and switched to APB Innova a russian server, less cheater more fun.
1056	1	a	Very fun
2779	1	a	This game is a great MMO. Be a crimilnal and rob people or be a vigilante and stop the criminals. Play with me on the server thats closet to your location ;)

4083	0	a	This Game is bad in every way that isnt making it good. Very Bad. Very, Very Bad
10465	0	a	To be honest you could tell they were trying to meke this game exactly like Fallout NV or 3 but its whatever. The controls seem a little slow and unresponsive. The quests do seem fun but don't really have much taste.  
7096	0	a	I haven't played for very long, but that doesn't mean I can't say that I don't like it. It tries to be like GTA but ends up being a freemium-esque game. Horrible quality. Zero stars.
8407	0	a	The Game is a concept thats pretty cool, but is executed poorly.  Pro's- -the game is Free. -Large map -Good Graphics Con's -Requires a beast of a pc to run properly -EVERYTHING is behind a pay wall -Unbalanced -IF you even buy some gun, you only keep it for 3 days -Map is lacking most detail -i found no use for in-game currency  Overall it's a 4.5/10 for me, I don't reccomend it, but you try this game, i's for 'free'
3851	0	a	The medicore gameplay and seemingly limitless customization gives the game extreme potential (nothing beats driving a windowless white van with 'free candy' painted on the sides), but the blantly underscored Pay2Win business model and the imbalance it creates for players will cause you to rage so hard that your blood pressure and body temprature will rise high enough for your insides to become Oblivion and you â¥â¥â¥â¥ diamonds.  It's a damn shame: expanding the objectives in the game's missions and retooling the buisness model to make it more fair could really unlock a good bit of that potential.
6118	0	a	Too much lag and I can't start the game.
9640	0	a	This Used to be an ok MMO but has declined quite a bit
1603	1	a	it actually works now
1813	1	a	Free to play. Guns. Need I say more?
3068	1	a	its sort of fun
7690	0	a	its a really fun game, the world is expansive and you can customize the music, cars, clothes and many other things which is a pretty big plus.. but no matter how hard you work, its very oriented toward people who buy stuff in game, no matter how hard you worked for that machine gun by doing missions, you only get it for maybe a few days or a week, but if you buy it, its yours for good.  but ig your ok with that then this is your game, but I myself hate when someone a lower level blows me to bits with a machine gun and leaves me in the dust using a muscle car that goes double my speed, making it a quickly ending speed chase.  and even though it says I only played for an hour or so, I've had days of playing this game before I had it on steam, sad the say that it hasnt changed.
3246	1	a	Be who you can't be.
2024	1	a	Like that Fairfight :)
5768	0	a	This is a game I wish I could love because who doesn't want to play Cops And Robbers: Online?  Sadly though, the game is absolutely broken by blatant, no apologies pay to win (which is a term I hear thrown around a lot but I have never found as relevant as with APB) policies, a pretty pronounced bias for the criminals, and flat-out meaningless 'matchmaking'.  Let me put it this way: after a one year hiatus, I came back and made a new character. As I was relearning the mechanics and how to play, I queued up for my first match and was pitted against a gold-ranked superhero who had a gun that killed me in two shots, a rocket launcher, and a machine gun for a secondary weapon. Only bother with this game if you have about a hundred bucks of disposable income that you want to spend on the in-game store.
9681	0	a	I have to say i was playing a while and... THE GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's boring, has alot of bugs ex. no sound when punching, the story is bad. I don't reccomend it for gamers, it's just a waste of a time.
4695	0	a	I'm writing that I don't recommend this game because it isn't a type of game that everyone can enjoy. That being said, it you have a large wallet and are willing to shell out atleast $25 then you can consider it something you might enjoy. The game is almost 100% pay to win and being a member with all F2P weapons will almost guarantee that you will slit your wrists and die. Other than that, if you can get past the waves of hackers that go undetected with speed hacks, aimbot, and no recoil then all and all it's not an awful third person shooter.
8277	0	a	Pay to win crap...ad that is all i have to say. Pay to Win or pay to do anthing really..cant customize anything unless you shell out cash
