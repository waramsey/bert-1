1	1	a	  Orcs Must Die! is a fun and simple tower defense game:    - Casual and easy to learn: you can play for less than an hour and still have fun! - Lots of different orcs to kill: melee orcs, range orcs, flying orcs, etc. - Lots of different ways to kill orcs: weapons, powers, traps, and guardians
3	1	a	Nice polished fun TD/3PS. Got to finish it sometime. High quality game for cheap, what's not to like?
5	1	a	Fun game which offers a fresh take on the tower-defense genre. By putting you in the middle of the fray there is never a dull moment. The monsters are fun, the traps are fun, the character is fun and the gameplay is challenging and (wait for it) fun. What more could you expect? If you catch this game during a steam-sale you should definately give it a try.
7	1	a	So.Very.Fun  There is nothing more to say, this game is amazing fun and I really don't understand why everyone does not play it.
9	1	a	Orc Must Die is typically one of those indie games that must be in the library of those gamers who a) like the RPG genre b) are fond of indie games. This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.  It is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.  If you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.
11	1	a	This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:  1. How in the hell does the skull system work...??? 2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...??? 3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???  Here are the short versions to those answers:  1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious 'target time' that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select 'statistics' from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.  2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.  3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.  If you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:  1. Wind Bracers 2. Archers 3. Tar pits 4. Barricades 6. Ice amulet 7. Steel Weaver -&gt; Death Augmenter  You'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.  You'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.  Are fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.  It's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.  I'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.
13	1	a	Orcs don't have to die, but they keep walking into my traps.
15	1	a	  Originally posted by  The TL,DR Genie :
17	1	a	Stay away...too addictive
19	1	a	Nice tower defense-ish game. Basically you have to control the flow of Orcs in such a way that you manage to kill them all (either with traps or by yourself).  I think it is quite a good game. Also you can get it cheap enough as it currently is in the Humble (Jumbo) Bundle.
21	1	a	This game actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Stragtigically placing all the wonderfully wicked traps to kill as many Orcs as possible before they get to the point where you have to fend them off is a great challange. Picking your traps is fun considering there are many to choose from. traps are also upgradable which is definatley a nice touch. Would I recommend this game, yes to anyone. So why not go on over and get your copy now and while you are there grab Orcs must die 2 and the DLC....I did!
23	1	a	 1-sentence review :
25	1	a	I hate orcs and this is good for my soul
27	1	a	Wasn't expecting much from this. Wasn't expecting much at all. Then I played the game and slapped myself in the face. Later I looked in the mirror and berated myself for being an idiot. Then I wiped away my self-inflicted tears and went back to my computer with new tears in my eyes... tears of joy brought by this game.
29	1	a	If you've ever had the sadistic urge to kill en masse with a plethora of cruel, innovative, and brutal methods this is the game for you
31	1	a	Nice take on an FPS tower defense. Worth playing just for the hilarious dialogue alone.
33	1	a	Definitely rare, when the entire objective of a game can be put into its title. Very easy to learn, nice build-up 'tutorial' (one thing every round), and funny characters with awesome lines.
35	1	a	Me: God please show me a good TD game. God: Ok son, take this game ''Orcs must die!'' Me: Thanks god.
37	1	a	Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.  Orcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.  The gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.  The performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.  Orcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore, has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. It’s a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.  Ratings system: For this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.  Concept: 6.5/10 Gameplay: 5.5/10 Overall: 5.5/10  Thanks for reading my review!

39	1	a	  5 out of 5
41	1	a	Good meat!
43	1	a	This game is a blast it is easy and fun to play. The in game dialouge is funny and the story is understandable  RATE IT 8.5/10
45	1	a	Really fun take on tower defense. good design. AAA art quality.
47	1	a	Exellent twist on the tower defence games, allowing you to control a hero as the waves decend.  funny story easy to control (works with controller) cool puzzels (great challange, not sure if you reference this as a puzzel game) this one is single player, but adds a competitive edge with leader boards, beat your friends.  lots ot fun, would recommend it.
49	1	a	This is a great game. I was hesitant at first, but a third person tower defense game kept me entertained for hours. I managed to get the second one as well. It's a fairly difficult game, depending on your skill level.  
51	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an outstanding, well done Indie game with excellent, quick and ongoing support in the Steam forums by Robot Entertainment. This game can be played several different ways, so there is great replayability. Examples: 1) you can play just to complete the 24 War Mage mode levels followed by the 24 Nightmare mode levels, followed by 5 levels more for each if you own the DLC, 2) you can playthrough to '5 skull' all the levels, and 3) you can playthrough trying to achieve higher or top scores by using different combinations of traps. You MUST, however, make sure you have at least a dual core processor as this game heavily uses the second core for its animations. I highly recommend this game!
53	1	a	You know from the developer said about Orcs Must Die:  Slice them Burn them Chop them Pound them Freeze them  You can use any methods to kill Orcs in this game, simple concepts but varies of executions. Your war mage is become like one man army, dealing with thousands of orcs every time you play this.  You got traps, guardian, spells and weavers to help you killing the orcs, you'll never regret it how things works out if you play this.   This is a hybrid of 3rd person shooter and Real Time Strategy (RTS) because you need to know what kind of trap that will make orcs unable to enter your rift and don't forget of Big Boys such as Ogres and Bat for the Air units.
55	1	a	I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
57	1	a	This is an awesome game, lots of action, and humor. The best part is you can play this on the crappiest laptops/computers!
59	1	a	 Orcs must die  belongs to a genre that is obviously meant to be have repetitiveness, but in a good way so no reason to explain that . You have to stop horde of ogres from getting into some kind of orb that powers you and the valley. Use traps, weapons, guardians and powers to stop the horde. It may sound boring but trust me you'll love it. It has a bit of story that continues on OMD 2! so it is recommended to buy both on bundle. + Play as you wish. First 2 levels are meant to teach you but after that kill them however you want. + Plenty of creative environment kills available + Increasing difficulty doesn't mean the health bar will just increase. Instead, a lot of varied types of ogres come that requires good knowledge of weapons that you'll pick before starting the stage + Creative weapons + Funny + Really cheap on sale  -Just when you think you have the grip, the game ends -No boss ending, kill the last horde and the game will just end after a cutscene  ~Stages are not sorted according to difficulty well. There are difficult levels and some dead easy levels right after that. But maybe thats how they want it to be.   Overall I give this game 7/10 Nick Cage and a big heeeeehaw!  
61	1	a	This game is quite simple: Shoot, slice and blow up all the orcs. Its a nice mix of TD and a medieval fighting game. WIth the talent-like choices you can personalise how you wanna play each level, going trap heavy, combat heavy or a mix. The story is not bad but is not the strong point. The funny coments you character makes sometimes are quite cool tho. 08/10!  Pros: - Kill orcs (need say more?) - Several diferent levels with diferent kinds of enemies - Choose how you wanna play (TD heavy or slash/shoot heavy) - Smart ♥♥♥ coments that can actualy make you giggle (maybe...)  Cons: - Not story rich - Could get repetitive (but really, killing orcs gets boring for you guys??)
63	1	a	Orcs Must Die is just an amazing game, you'll have a smile on my face every moment you're in game.   The title pretty much explains the basics of the game, but without mentioning the best part, the traps!  The game is a tower defence/Third person shooter in which you must defend the rift in each castle. The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.  You start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun).   At the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift.   Levels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.  The only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.  But overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.
65	1	a	I got this game for .99 cents when it was on sale, I thought it wouldn\'t be much fun but the opposite is true. This game is a surprising rendition of a classic TD but has a very unique element to it, You are the Character setting traps and slaying orcs with a crossbow. This game with all its unique trap combos, my favorite the Floor Burner with a spring trap to make them endlessly run through it again and again, makes the gameplay enjoyable, there are a few annoying maps but all in all a great game   Lets take a minute to go through the pros and cons  Pros- The game is surprisingly addictive slaughtering orcs over and over with a trap combo  The game has unique traps and different map levels each time so you don\'t get used to the same strategy  The headshot feature is my personal favorite   Archers on a bridge are OP  The Graphics are suprisingly great   Cons- The music for the orcs is a bit redundant but fun  I wish OGRES weren\'t so OP as well as the Fliers if you get caught offguard   Overview- I would recommend this game for someone who likes TD\'s and Strategy   PS. Or slaughtering orcs :D
67	1	a	WTF is it? - Orcs Must Die! is a third-person trap laying orc slaying monster delaying tower defense game. It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.  Verdict - Well worth the time and money.  BTW - This is better than that Rift mmo.
69	1	a	Better than i thought it would be. 10/10
71	1	a	I have very fond memories of this funny and polished third-person tower defense game. Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.  The game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.  Aside from that, highly recommended game. If you've never played Orcs Must Die 2, get this one on sale and play it first, and see if you get as hooked as I did.
73	1	a	Must have !
75	1	a	Very fun tower defence game
77	1	a	How does a TD (tower defense) sound combined with a third person shooter? combine it with crazy enemies and you've got Orcs Must Die! This game and its second version have small differences like the enchanters(or whatever they called themselves) OMD2 is more polished and has multiplayer but isn't as good for 1 person so get this if you have no real friends(like me)   If you're interested look up some gameplay videos on youtube :D
79	1	a	I'm enjoying this game a lot at the moment and it reminds me a lot of Dungeon Defenders. I purchased this and Orcs Must Die 2 in a Steam sale around a year ago I think and i definitely see myself replaying the game on Nightmare difficulty.  Your character is a funny war mage tasked with defending the various dungeons and bastions from an onslaught of ogres, kobolds and orcs. You get to control the war mage in third person as well as actively managing your traps.  Unlike some games you have to wait for a break or stoppage in waves to replace or build traps. In this game you can sell, and lay traps whilst the waves are happening (as long as you or an enemy aren't in the place you want to place your trap).  I felt like they could of expanded the story each level to give a sense of immersion, but the gameplay makes up for this flaw.  If you love tower defense games but want an alternative to your standard one then give this a try.  Pros:  - Fun Gameplay - Nice Assortment of Enemies - Quirky Main Protagonist - Plethora of Traps - Dynamic Trap Management - Cool Looking Artwork/Graphics  Cons:  - Not a very in-depth Storyline - Short Campaign - Graphics May not Appeal To Some - No Coop or Multiplayer Aspect. 
81	1	a	A nice little take on the tower defense and the third person shooter genres. The only draw back outside of the weapon DLC being a bit overpriced for what it gives you is that the main charecters limited repitor of speech files can get a bit grating after a few levels. But if you like tower defense games or even Dungeon Defenders but wished it's single player was better you will like this game.

85	1	a	Most Tower Defense games are a fairly hands-off genre; you build towers and they do their thing, with your involvement being where to put them and when to upgrade. But lately there have been some that let the player get into the action more personally, and Orcs Must Die is a great example of that. Compared to the nameless protagonists of the last two games, OMD puts you in the shoes of the Apprentice, one of many War Mages tasked with defending rifts to the human world from bands of invading orcs. His tutelage has come to an end though, thanks to his master taking a fatal tumble, forcing him into the role completely. As the Apprentice is a combination of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast and Groose from Skyward Sword, this isn't necessarily a good thing, especially not when the orcs seem to be getting more organized suddenly.  Instead of defending whole territories like other games, each level in Orcs Must Die takes place in a different fort, with a rift on one end and the orcs (as well as other enemies) charging in through the other. So rather than towers, you'll be placing down booby traps instead: spike traps on the floor, walls that shoot out arrows, even swinging maces you can put on low ceilings. It's not too hard to create a total death course enemies will futilely try to wade through. The game's combo system, the ragdoll physics, and the orcs' voice clips as they're being pulverized all help encourage this very well. The Apprentice also has some weapons of his own for crowd control, or the odd enemy that manages to get through your traps.  Each level offers up to five skulls, four for not taking any damage and one for speed, which you can use to upgrade your traps permanently. These range from extra damage on some, to slowing enemies, to dramatically increasing speed. It can make many traps much more useful, although what you spend can't be refunded. The game has 24 levels, which I beat in about ten hours. That unlocks the Nightmare difficulty, which offers tougher enemy placement and much less time to prepare between waves. I didn't find the base game that difficult, so it's a nice option if you want it. There's also some cheap DLC, which offers a few extra tools and some new levels; nothing necessary, but good if you want to get a bit more out of the game. And with one this well-made, there's not much reason you wouldn't.
87	1	a	Overall a good game for slaughtering Orcs. Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.  The cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way. Considering the purpose of this game, I would say this is one of the best Indie games I've played in a while and I look forward to playing Orcs Must Die! 2 as well.
89	1	a	a nice little tower defense game with lots of gibs! only thing bad is no co-op.
91	1	a	FPS meets Defend-Your-Castle-style play. On top of fun and demanding gameplay, this game also has a fantastic soundtrack and a great sense of humor.
93	1	a	Hours of orc-killing fun.
95	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game. You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways. In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them. This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side. After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn. These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians.   After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME. I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions). Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay! There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost. It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.   However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs. Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat. If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube. And if you like what you see, buy it. Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.   TLDR: 10/10   Disclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review. Harmed before, oh hell yes!
97	1	a	This game helped me discover something important about myself. The fact that I apparently can never get tired of watching orcs die on traps.
99	1	a	Sometimes I almost feel bad for the orcs. Except, not really
101	1	a	Very addictive!
103	1	a	Super awesome game where you do tower defense while attacking stuff. You get to kill hoards of orcs!
105	1	a	There is: -Deadly Orcs -Some really deadly Orcs -Orc friends to are trying to kill you -Lots of killing -Lots of traps for said killing -Lots of ways to lay said traps -Lots of options for said ways And lastly, -One crazy witch  Need I say more?  GET IT.
107	1	a	So many mangled/slashed/stabbed/burnt/crushed/melted orcs
109	1	a	This is a really enjoyable game.
111	1	a	Some games you can tell are going to be good from the first 10 minutes of playing them. Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone.   But presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.  At the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.  Overall the game was loads of fun. I've had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it's often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it's a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.
113	1	a	A solid 7/5 this was probably how I got a rollie coastie headache. I'm sure though that this game will be fun. I promise.
115	1	a	✓ Good graphics and design ✓ Humour ✓ Nice animations ✓ Good game engine and special effect ✓ Overall nice presentation  ✘ No Linux support.
117	1	a	It's very fun, but I'm mostly just writing this for the coal.
119	1	a	Great game with nice humour
121	1	a	Not sure if this is a third-person tower defense game or a shooter game on steroids. Either way, ORCS  MUST  DIE!
123	1	a	Very fun action/tower defense game. The dialog and animations are funny, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is thrilling. Not like any other TD I have ever played.
125	1	a	Ok so this game represents everything wrong with society in my opinion, What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is so bad about Orcs that we just need to keep killing them and killing them and killing them. Like I bet if we just treated them fairly they would be just really chilled out and help us out and ♥♥♥♥ but noooo just because they are stronger than us (Insecurity much?) and have different colour skin (Racism much?) we have to spike them and shoot them and smash them up. Y'know what? ♥♥♥♥ this. I wanna be an Orc.  10/10 would think I'm playing Sanctum again.
127	1	a	Really enjoyed playing this game.  Applying third person shooter with a tower defense element was like a match made in heaven with me, the variety of maps, weapons, traps and etc. really made for various types of strategies.  Absolute fun game and was one of the first games i completed for 100% achievements due to the amount of fun I had playing it =]
129	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a nice twist on the traditional tower defence genre. Instead of building towers to defeat creeps (orcs), you set traps along their path. The game is played in third person view, so you can also kill orcs with your own spells and weapons too (similarly to Sanctum). OMD is exactly what it says on the box. You kill orcs in hundreds of different ways as they make their way to the end of the level. The premise is simple and it's fun to work out various strategies to kill orcs. Items, weapons, spells and weavers (special abilities) can all be used. Some levels are frustrating, though a bit of logical thinking goes a long way. The visuals are very smooth and fit into the laid back, humourous style of the game. The storyline and voice acting are a bit cheesy, but OMD doesn't take itself too seriously, which adds to the charm. Great game to play casually.
131	1	a	KINDA REMINDIN ME OF MY DAWG RUFUS WHO GOT HIT BY A TRUCK NIQQA LOOKED LIKE A FKN ORC YA DONT WANNA NO  GAMES GUD CEPT FOR THE BICH @SS MAIN GUY WHO LOOK LIKE HE TAKING A GIANT TURD ALL OF THE FKN TIME  WE STILL HERE NEFF MARCH 2K14 HOOD
133	1	a	fun and entertaining, worth getting if on sale. all around good game 
135	1	a	Combining a tower defense game with a shooter.... awesome! It is also a highly polished and humurous game with tons of replayability.
137	1	a	Is good game. Play very well orc kills. Recommended in holiday children times.
139	1	a	'You go first'
141	1	a	It's the sorely needed missing link between Tecmo's Deception and mainstream appeal. No satan worshipping, though :/
143	1	a	I'll keep this short and sweet. This game was a great mash-up between strategy and tower defense. Only took me about 4 hours to beat the whole game. Would have been nice to have some multiplayer/co-op, but for that I'm am looking forward to the sequel. Grab it when it's on sale and spend an afternoon or weekend enjoying this game. Excellent replay value as well.
145	1	a	Do yourself a favour and get the frickin game!!!!!
147	1	a	This is actualy a really neat game :D the hurmor so far is pretty funny, the gameplay is exceedingly fun, and really makes for a good mix of stratagy and action! so if you like tower defense, violance, and action (run around and shashing up stuff/shooting stuff..) games this is a fun game to get :D
149	1	a	Ultimate time-eater. Probably even better then Plants vs. Zombies in this aspect. Get it and you won't regret it.
151	1	a	Orc's must die and Orc's must die 2 is an addictive, fast bpaced and incredibly fun game. It's easy to pick up the game play and the UI is intuitive and well made. The Graphics and color is Awesome !! The music really sets the mode and is really cool. I would recemend this game to anyone... ( 5 out of 5 stars) BO
153	1	a	This was my first steam game! And its good.
155	1	a	This is one hell of a fun reverse-tower-defense game, mixed in with a FPS. Great stuff. If you like battling orcs, then you'll love Orcs Must Die!
157	1	a	One of my favorite games. Loads of fun in a strategy/puzzle FPS.
159	1	a	Get this game. Kill orcs. Have fun. Get extra maps for the sequel.
161	1	a	This game... the most fun I've had in ages!
163	1	a	This game is amaizing! Worth every penny! Can't wait for more DLC's to come out.
165	1	a	Awesome game!Unique gameplay and defense tactics, very nice upgrades. Lots of humor and you get to kill LOTS OF ORCS! :D I recommend this game, it's playable by all ages, no matter whether you are 12, 20, 40, 70... :D You will like it! It's lots of fun. I would give it a 10/10! :)
167	1	a	Fun game full of orcy destruction.
169	1	a	Looks childish, but it is amazingly fun! Hours of gameplay and quite addicting! And it's not like one of those games where once you have good stuff everything is easy, the levels get super challenging. The downloadable content (DLC) is incredible, it makes the game 10 times better. I definately suggest buying this game AND the DLCs. Awesome game, and I highly recommend it!
171	1	a	The most fun you can have without signing a waiver.
173	1	a	Epic Fun with a unique twist. An original game concept done well.
175	1	a	Easy to learn and hard to master. Very fun and flexible to meet a lot of different play styles.
177	1	a	Fun game love all the trap, wepaons and spells variations. Great game in my eyes worth the buy.
179	1	a	It's a trap! Well, quite a few of them actually. And you can upgrade them. Orcs Must Die! puts a proactive spin on the tower defense genre. Different enemy types require tactical thinking and you'll find yourself going back to older levels to try new stregies. Fun!
181	1	a	Got to love this game. Tower defense, FPS, Story progression, hilarious... This game has it all. This is a great goto game when you have a few mins to kill.
183	1	a	Super-fun 1-player beat-em-up / tower-defence game.
185	1	a	Quality tower defense game (minus the towers). It's got traps, it's got shootan, it's got pretty funny jokes, and a buttload of content really.  Mindless fun.
187	1	a	Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.  Putting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.  I didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.  Overall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.
189	1	a	Brutal all the way. Must try
191	1	a	Hey ORCS MUUUUUUST DIE ... and u will kill the Orcs or they will kill u ... nice TD Game for Soloplayer ... many funny traps and gadgeds
193	1	a	Awesome game. very fun. Recommended!
195	1	a	PC Gamer is right. This game has a limited scope but within that scope it does it's thing extremely well. It's like an action puzzle, how to lay your traps and fight so that no orcs get through. The cartoony 3D environments are pretty and the variety of approaches to each scenario are a blast.
197	1	a	surprisingly deep and addicting. Giddy up before the sequel releases!
199	1	a	If you haven't got this game yet, get it! It's simple but fun, and challenging to get 5 skulls on each level. Truly a great find in 2011 gaming!
201	1	a	who wants more traps? I do! I do!
203	1	a	I really like this game. It's a charming 3rd person action tower defense score-chaser that doesn't take itself too seriously.   You set traps and kill things (sometimes even without the traps). There are lots of traps and lots of ways to play. This game uses a fairly simple scoring mechanism of kill steaks and combos (#of things hitting something as it dies) that is easy to understand, but tough to master so topping the leaderboards is quite the trick.  The price is affordable, the game has 24 levels that can be played on any of the 3 (only the last 2 matter) difficulty settings + a few more levels in the Lost Adventures DLC and I find it to be worth every penny.
205	1	a	It was alright
207	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
209	1	a	For eveyone who likes WC3 TD, this game is a must have! Awesome settings and you can now run around with your own charachter. I had a lot of fun! Tip: if you notice you did the wrong placement of traps within the first few rounds, just recreate the game and try a difference tactic.
211	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.  The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.  There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre.   8/10
213	1	a	Orcs Must Die! 2 is one of my all time favourite games. So when I checked out the original Orcs Must Die!, I was pleasantly surprised. This game is pretty much just Orcs Must Die! 2 singleplayer, and if you're a fan of the sequel, you should definently check this game out. 9\10, and yes I am a fanboy.
215	1	a	Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.  4/5 One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!
217	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.  Technically:    the game is a fantasy / medievial 'tower' defence + third person 'shoot everything that survived trap lines',    30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable    20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay,    nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay,    challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,   Gameplay notes:    The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,     The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave,    Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line,    Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff,    Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast,    Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them,    During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade.    Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story.    Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps,    No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2),    It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.    All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy.    The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad. Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.     His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity.    The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage.    Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall). Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one).    The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.   General info    OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle / dungeons. There is only one level theme.    Forget about cinematics. The storyline is presended via semi-animated drawings. This is a great idea and fits great into the game.    The orcs, the Warmage and the traps have a bit grotesque, comic design. Again, this suits the overall game mood, and slows down graphics 'aging'.    Amazing music. If you run into game OST, do buy it. I managed to get one from Humble Bundle.   Any problems?    Trap balance - some traps are simply better, some are just useless (Hint: use traps with large AOE and fast or no reload),    Since trap upgrades are permament, The Warmage usually sticks with favourite set with little room for experiment.    No co-op game (solved in OMD2)    The super-arogant hero can be hard to get used to. The humor can be sometimes percieved as primitive.    High emphasise placed on combat, it is not possible / extremly difficult to play only with the economy.    First two levels in nightmate are... too nightmareish, the difficulty seems to be easier further.    there are two levels in the game (including final), which must be simply learnt and played by hearth. In each wave the  Mage must build traps in particular area, buy a proper upgrade and solo secure another corridor.  Mispacing traps will leave the attacked corridor unsecured.     Strong sides    humor,    nice character design,    good overall ballance in map design,    good balance of strategic / economic components in gameplay (unless you don't like action in tower defences),    interesting maps,    high 'replayablity', level score to be maxed.   You should avoid the game, if you:    dislike action in tower defence and prefer them to be purely economic,    dislike arrogant and dumb protagonists   Do play if:    don't mind thinking / action hybrid,    look for a lot of fun,    tend to max each level  
219	1	a	Like tower defense games? How about in third person? Also do you like killing lots of orcs? Well then Orcs Must Die is the game for you as it has all 3. It's a really fun and addictive third person tower shooter game with really good gadgets and varied and tough enemies. You get to be really creative with the defense using all the neat gadgets in your arsenal. Also, the A.I is good in this game. Overall, if you like tower defense games, you'll have plenty of fun times in this game.

223	1	a	I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.  Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed) Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense   9/10 in my book The only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue
225	1	a	+) I liked how the game was. Your view, aim, the battle, sound and effects, etc.  +) Various types of enemies were interesting.  +) The fact that basic traps don't become obsolete was good.   -) It would've been more nice if we could fight the witch or was it mage?.  -) They make you click a lot. They should've made it auto so you can just press on. Not everyone is using game pads.  -) Having passive skills or upgrade for personal improvement would've been amazing but there was no such thing. There is a similar one but that's a choice and you have to spend defense money so NO to that.
227	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce! Bathe in that stuff youngster... it'll keep you sharp and youthful inside long past the point where hope and happiness fades into a bitter diy tincture that doesn't heal the wound that won't close... yes.... a most excellent orc genocide simulator! Bonus creatures included for happy end!! and it had a very good sequel also! :D
229	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
231	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
233	1	a	It was alright
235	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
237	1	a	Most fun I have had in a while. Consistant gameplay with little twists.
239	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce!

241	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
243	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
245	1	a	What it says on a tin.  Fun!  Fun-fun-fun. Polished game, smooth action. Game feels fluid and responsive Enjoyable. Challenging enough, nice pacing, has character progression.
247	1	a	Great game.
249	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredible new take on tower defense and full of action packed strategy!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTYqMiAfe7w 
251	1	a	Veridict: 9.0  The protagonist will make you laugh your *ss off, while the tower defense style of this game will turn you into a fan of the genre. And if you are already a 'tower defense guy', then this title is a must have.  Despite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.  Orcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.  Fun is the only word capable of defining this game. And if you ended it and liked it, don't get emotional.. there's a sequel for this: Orcs Must Die! 2, so you can keep playing and slaying more and more orcs.
253	1	a	Really fun game, reminds me of the days of dungeon keeper and setting up traps for the invasion of the good guys, Well in orcs must die, you are the good guys, doing it the other way round, setting traps for the bad guys.   Great game to play, can't recommend enough.
255	1	a	Love this game! :D Got it for my B-day years ago.
257	1	a	A very fun third-person tower defense/strategy game from a person point of view. Great humor, fun story, goofy voice acting and atmosphere, later levels can provide a solid challenge to the more skilled players.
259	1	a	The name of the game is defend teleportation rifts from onslaughts of hundreds of orcs with hilarious lines. You can do this with several weapons, spells and strategically placed traps, all of which are unlocked one by one for completing each of 24 different levels. While the game probably won't keep you glued for hours at a time due to its repetitive nature, it's at least 8 hours in length or more if you hope to achieve 5 stars (or skulls in this case) on every map to get the most out of your trap upgrades. I for one love traps and defensive structures in games, so needless to say, it got all the more amusing watching my traps grow to an un-escapeable nature by the last few waves of growing orc numbers and other varying monster types. It's great casual fun with a nice challenge and I reccomend it to anyone, as long as you can get past the fact that the options menu is quite limited. Oh, and no re-bindable keys. For shame!
261	1	a	One of the better tower defense games I have played. I'm more of a co-op gamer though, but when there is no one to play Orcs 2 with then this is a nice alternative, considering Orcs 2 is impossible solo.
263	1	a	Very addicting
265	1	a	Greate Game!  Much better than the sequel, because in the sequel you get the feeling, that the traps are ineffective.
267	1	a	This is the orginal, it is better than the sequel (OMD2).
269	1	a	Got it on sale, it is a great game to play when you are frustrated and need to calm down. I have 9 hours and am not even half way through, but I think I might be because I will only go to the next level if I get a perfect score.   I got it on sale, but I'd say it is worth the $10.
271	1	a	One of the best single player Action / Tower Defence games money can buy. Cheap and extremely fun, highly recomended.
273	1	a	Pretty fun fps/tower defense game.
275	1	a	Orcs must die! is fun to play and has epic music.The warmage also has some funny things to say during gameplay.
277	1	a	Not as good as Orcs Must Die 2! But still a really good game overall :)
279	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIztLKgtlNQ 
281	1	a	It was really fun to play, story is kind of good, graphics and gameplay are really nice.
283	1	a	Really fun single player game, you should check it out if you get the chance. Very addictive, and the constant mayhem and slaughter makes it a game I couldn't put down until I beat it.
285	1	a	Something about the fact that the orcs die purely for my own entertainment creeps me out a little. And also makes me a little giddy on the inside like my big brother just won me a prize at the carnival by throwing baseballs at sad clowns.
287	1	a	I had to stop because I had to click too much and it was annoying Chris on skype.
289	1	a	It took me cce 8 hours to complete first run on standard (not low) difficulty. Game offers variety of traps to serve one's 'style' - are you a direct damage dealer, tricky tactician, do you like traps to do all the work or do you like being engaged in a fight? These and many more options are offered. The variety of monsters, their stregnth, number in comparison with your abilities, traps and magic is well balanced. There are points in game where player must be very flexible. When you finish game, you can start with all upgrades and traps unlocked from previous run and do campaign from scratch. There are tougher monsters coming in already at start. This is sad, because I would welcome ability to play new game already on highest. I am not going to play again. Not because I wouldnt enjoy it, but because I have no time and want to finish other games, too. In short - great chillout game.
291	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a tower defens / shooter video game.  I'm personal really big fan of this games. You not only try to defens yourself and the portal with traps and towers. Because you have the option to fight your own. Charcter has a small amount of upgrades and new weapons to unlock and choice. It's has a very big number of challanges to complete to clear the full game. Very nice to play alone.. and alone because there is no freaking multiplayer... for this buy part 2. Easy to control video game and playing it with a controller plays very nice.  No co-op multiplay still.. a must have game for the tower defense / shooter lovers. I give this game a 8/10.
293	1	a	Good strategy game, nice set of traps and skill to play with. levels and be completed in different ways to get most points or just to have fun, tho on normal story can be completed in 3 hours.
295	1	a	This game is just fun. The gameplay is straight forward yet offers complexity as well. It doesn't take itself too seriously (this should have been obvious from the get go). Overall a good game especially if you can pick it up on sale.
297	1	a	Must orcs die!? And why is the death of ogres and gnolls a foregone conclusion of this? The title's inherent racism is not really questioned at any point. The only option towards a peaceful resolution is to buy drugs that become available late in the game and which you can never afford enough of to avoid bloodshed anyway. The player character is a smug, chauvinistic jock who relishes in the slaugher of people of different skin tones. Utterly disgusting. Servicable gameplay though if you can look past the developer's obviously politically inspired agenda behind this game.
299	1	a	Simple but very enjoyable. The main character is grand enough.
301	1	a	Guys this game so funny ) try it )
303	1	a	I am an avid FPS gamer, and despite my tendency to skimp on other genres, I have to say, this game is excellent! Great for killing time. Lots of colours and goofy traps.   It doesn't however feature a coop mode, but fortunately that was introduced in OMD2.  A solid package all around :)
305	1	a	Really fun, I love it :) 8/10
307	1	a	This is one of very best tower defense game
309	1	a	its a incredibly goooooood game
311	1	a	Bullet Point Review :  + Action packed and fast paced + Challenging when reaching the endgame + Cool soundtrack + Witty humor + Smooth looking graphics + The game really motivates you to finish it, which immediately sets it aside from 9 out of 10 games.  - Danger of getting stuck, especially for casual gamers. ( Real casual gamers, not the term 'casual' hardcore gamers like to use for the average gamer ) - Repetitive to a certain degree - Bullet projectiles make no sense ( you have to aim above the head to get a headshot )  Conclusion : 9/10
313	1	a	I wasn't expecting this to be so outrageously fun. I bought it in a sale and was not disappointed at all.  Very fun!
315	1	a	Orkmobslashing headshotspreading corpsestomping greenskinshredding gnollstunning fun. Seriously. Try the demo, if you don't believe my supreme Opinion of supremeness, which is supreme.... by superiority! ;D
317	1	a	Crazy fun action tower defense style game, you'l be hooked within one level. Funny and enjoyable.  It's a healthy blend of Shooter with Tower Defense, allowing you to build traps on the walls, ceilings, and floors to create unique kill zones. But also letting you equip spells and weapons to fight off the Orcs that way if you'd like.
319	1	a	Great looks, performance, humor, MUSIC and action!! Do not miss this game!
321	1	a	gut busters
323	1	a	Wow this game is addicting! Part shooter, part tower defense, this game is AMAZING! Not to mention hilarious! The point of the game is to defend Rifts, and to do this you must place traps on the floors, use magic, and your trusty crossbow. But the funny part comes with the way you can defeat the opposing Orcs. One way is to place Spring Boards on the floor that launch the orcs whereever you aim the board. This can result in humorous and deadly outcomes. Another example is the dialogue, just plain goofy! Plus....drum roll please....ACHIEVEMENTS!!! Yup another game with achievements to keep the gamer coming back for more slightly-stoopid bragging rights! Pick this game up! Its unique, funny, fun, and OMG FUN!!!
325	1	a	I like this game! This is basically a tower defense + third person shooter, similar to Sanctum, but with a much better sense of humor and style, and doesn't give me motion sickness. Within the first five minutes of playing, I quickly felt inclined to play through the rest, which is a rare experience these days.   There's a good progression, as the game starts to get noticeably harder in the final levels. There is a nightmare difficulty once you beat the game on normal, for an even harder challenge. Every level you're presented with a new trap or item, but I found myself not using most of them, having tried them out and finding them less effective than existing gear. Since every level offers up to 5 stars, replay is fairly good for those striving for the most reward out of each level.  Well worth the asking price, especially on a sale. I hear the recently released sequel is even better, so I look forward to that.
327	1	a	One of the most fun 'tower defence' games ever.
329	1	a	I liked Dungeon Defenders a lot, but Orcs Must Die is even better. There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!  The game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.  And since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game. Highly recommended as i guarantee you countless hours of insane fun!
331	1	a	Nice game, I want to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
333	1	a	Tower defense and first person action blend incredibly well in this masterpiece. Aside from a hilarious cartoonish humor, the challenges are diffcult enough to keep you playing for dozens of hours. The music score is fantastic and the graphics are colorful. I suggest this game to anybody who enjoys tower defense games!
335	1	a	This game is an absolute riot and blast to play. No MP support, but the SP game is a ton of fun and some of it is extremely challenging.
337	1	a	I definatley recommand this game and I hope u have extra cash cause your going to want part 2 after playing this!
339	1	a	Gives perfectionists high blood pressure.
341	1	a	I have wanted this game for a long time..Thanks steam for a wonderful sale!!! Let the killing begin!
343	1	a	One of the most fun tower defense games I have ever played! The controls are perfect, the humor is spot on, the character animations reek with personality, there's lots of replayability if you want to get the highest scores and ratings per stage, the story is hilarious and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! What also makes a great tower defense game is freedom in how you accomplish your goal. This game definitely leaves room for success via various strategies. Definitely a must buy!
345	1	a	Probably the best tower defence/trap defence game ever.
347	1	a	When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
349	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
351	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
353	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
355	1	a	I iz an Orc and I fink dis game is inkredibly rood.
357	1	a	Fun. Try out OMD 2.
359	1	a	addictive game!! really awesome arcadish kindo' game graphics but really superb!! While playing the game its intensity and quickness makes me too much impulsive!
361	1	a	This is like a tower defense game, in which you build catapults, and traps to kill ogres to prevent them from reaching their objective. Really entertaining and challenging.
363	1	a	I feel sorry for the female orcs..........
365	1	a	this is very fun and unique, played through it many times and it encourages you to go back and perfect the game. Reminds me of plants vs zombies in its addictiveness.
367	1	a	Excellent Tower Defense with a 3rd person fighter twist. So addicting.
369	1	a	This is one of the best and engaging Tower Defense games I have ever played. It mixes third person shooting and trap placing strategy so well it couldn't be done any better.  Очень крута таур дифен игра, нергична, бытра и овершенно некучна. Эта игра — кайрим воего жанра.
371	1	a	Hands up who wants to die!
373	1	a	A very biased piece that criminally neglects to show the staggering number of grieving mother orcs and countless baby orcs now forced to grow up in a single parent household. White man strikes again...
375	1	a	When I play Orcs I feel my iq plummet like TV viewership around election time.  Building killboxes then listening to the orcs scream in pain brings tears to my eyes as I laugh at their terminal one-liners. I am a sick sick man.
377	1	a	+1
379	1	a	Orcs Must Die, what are you waiting for? buy the game, or no, hold on, now that hte second one is out buy the second one.
381	1	a	Great combination of tower defense, rpg, and physics = amazing orc killing pc game!!
383	1	a	This game is AWESOMENESS
385	1	a	Great game ,easy at first but harder at the end ,  lots of cool items and traps , the only thing i miss in a multipalayer mode/map
387	1	a	A Great Singlepayer Third Person Tower Defence, If that's what you're looking for and If that's not what you want then buy it anyways
389	1	a	Really fun game, well worth the money paid for.
391	1	a	I've never had this much fun killing orcs!
393	1	a	Great physics game that gets progressively harder in single player tower defense action. Weilding your crossbow, you fight a army of orcs attempting to survive them and find out what is happening. Owning this game and the second gives you classic levels in the first one as well. Recommend if you get the second orcs must die for the complete story and extra levels with friends.
395	1	a	Wow, the tower defense titles these days actually improve on what is already a fun game genre. In Orcs Must Die you control a warmage, in third person view. So instead of building traps in an isometric sort of view, you now run around setting up traps and actively killing enemies with your character. There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun. Other than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts. Only downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel. Don't let that stop you from buying it though !  [Rating: 87/100]
397	1	a	This is the perfect game.  Demands both strategy and skill. Action packed, challenging and funny. 
399	1	a	I want a present.
401	1	a	This game is so much fun, a combination of tactics and action that combines pretty well.   8/10
403	1	a	Pretty accurate marketing.
405	1	a	Addictive.
407	1	a	I'd let those damn orcs win if they stop running straight in to arrow traps and spike traps and falling in to acid pits the damn orcs got ♥♥♥♥ing rocks for brains
409	1	a	Though there barely ain't any, the plot is quite ok and VERY FUNNY. Stuff you can use without DLC is ok, but with DLC it's just amazing. Main Char is nice.   Get it with the DLC and it will be epic awesome despite the lack of co-op or any kind of multiplayer mode.   P.S. So much fun making catapults combos.
411	1	a	A little rough around the edges but a fun little td type action game.
413	1	a	The polish on this game is uncanny. The art is fantastic, the gameplay is loads of fun, and there's excellent balance between the tower defense style play and the hack 'n slash aspect. You can't be good at just one, and you really need to use them together. Story is amusing too. Love the juvenile humor.
415	1	a	Lay traps and keep killing orcs and their allies, bit like a zombie game except more fun!!!!!
417	1	a	Good game !! but once completed its boringg D: ! Recommended
419	1	a	Boring too quick
421	1	a	awsome fun filled game made me forget my girlfriend a must buy if you want to divert your mind into funcoholic!!
423	1	a	Best TPP defence/shooter game, a must-have!
425	1	a	As much as I hate Tower Defense I just love this game! It's very simple: build traps, lure the orcs in, if some orcs miss traps and live you just need to finish the job with your weapon or magic. And as primitive as it sounds it is crazy fun. So get this game and enjoy it! And then get part 2 and enjoy it even more in coop with a friend.
427	1	a	Orcs and more need to die.  Traps traps traps, kill kill kill Good fun.
429	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an orc racism simulation. You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is 'Orcs Must Die!' It's not 'Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime' or 'Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense' or 'Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War' or anything like that. Replace 'Orcs' with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs. I give this game 13 out of 16 race riots.
431	1	a	A highly addictive 3D tower defense game that simply feels right; the game is just long enough, the trap and enemy variety feel diverse without feeling bloated, and the pacing feels perfect too.
433	1	a	Without a doubt, one of the finest and most engaging games out there.
435	1	a	Its actually not bad
437	1	a	Love this game, so much fun. Just buy it already.
439	1	a	Its a must buy because:  - game is cheap - game is cool - game is fun - achievements are reasonable - can be play as casual or more hardcore
441	1	a	Incredibly stress relieving fun. Build ♥♥♥♥, kill orcs. Cest tous. :-)
443	1	a	A great Tower Defence + FPS, must have!
445	1	a	Okay, so how come it starts off easy, then suddenly a few levels in, BLAM, I can't get through it?? All the previous levels took me one go, then I get hit by a level I cannot pass. I am NOT going to YouTube for a solution. That is dumb. That is for Candy Crush Saga. Frustrating, and I should blame myself. But I won't, I blame the developers. Anyway, if you like tower defense games, this is one. But up close in 3D.
447	1	a	Meh. Good for a while.
449	1	a	Orcs. They must die. DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!!
451	1	a	Theese
453	1	a	Killing orcs have never been this fun!  P.S. Also you can kill kobolds, gnols, ogres and other nasties.
455	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
457	1	a	I love this game, it's a beautiful tower defense game, when i bought it, i played it till the end. 6 hours of game in a row 
459	1	a	there be goblins
461	1	a	Super fun game and all but Orcs Must Die 2 is out so just buy that unless this is mega on sale. Also buying this game will unlock some more levels in omd2. (7/10)
463	1	a	The best 'tower defense' game I ever played.

467	1	a	Great game, great times! Funny easily enjoyable game.
469	1	a	Well polished, funny and addictive. One of the better releases of 2011 that takes the tedium out of the Tower Defense genre.
471	1	a	Best 'Tower Defence' game what I have played sofar!
473	1	a	8/10 - Kill a couple of Orcs, then kill more of them and repeat the cycle. Sounds boring? Tell me how it can sounds boring, because it sounds epic.
475	1	a	awesome game for lovers of third person 
477	1	a	its dungeon defenders but it doesnt make you want to kill yourself when you play it
479	1	a	A superb 'Tower Defense' game that will have you coming back for more.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRtNMrV-PY   Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die in this fantasy action-strategy game from Robot Entertainment.   As a powerful War Mage with dozens of deadly weapons, spells, and traps at your fingertips, defend twenty-four fortresses from a rampaging mob of beastly enemies, including ogres, hellbats, and of course, a whole bunch of ugly orcs. Battle your enemies through a story-based campaign across multiple difficulty levels, including brutal Nightmare mode!   Will you roast orcs in pits of lava, pound them flat with a ceiling trap, or freeze and shatter them with a slash? No matter the weapons and traps you choose, you’re sure to have an orc-killing blast! - Highly Recommended! 
481	1	a	best played multiplayer though
483	1	a	Highly recommended for the fans of the genre.
485	1	a	Best tower defense / hack and slash i have ever played. Worth it's price and more.
487	1	a	I Love the game
489	1	a	Killing Orks! Not as Spacemarine this time, but still with a Warhammer, if you preordered.  The Game is comparable to Sanctum, but has a lot more levels and depth. You get an insane amount of Traps, Levels and also Perks later in Act 2. I really enjoy it.  Could have more Achievements though :p.
491	1	a	it's like skyrim with orcs
493	1	a	OMD is an entertaining, furiously addictive mixture of 3rd person shooter and tower defense, with a splendid soundtrack that perfectly compliments the frantic action. You play as the rather dense but ♥♥♥♥♥ure Warmage, who must defend the magical Rifts from untold numbers of marauding orcs, using an array of traps, guardians, spells and weapons. The main game of achieving a 5-skull rating (no orcs escaping, within a par-time) on all maps is a good challenge - which further fuels your abilities at large-scale orc maiming, as skulls can then be spent to upgrade your equipment. Slaying the hordes is plenty fun enough, however therein also lies a complex combo-system adding much further depth of play, where the more traps and their afflictions hit an orc, the higher the combo-points, thus making every map replayable to experiment and chase that higher score. Crisp graphics, great voicing, music, humour and still packed with pure, fun gameplay that's as good on a pad as with a mouse. Quality arcade action that's only surpassed by it's more content heavy sequel, yet still worth playing first.
495	1	a	Battle waves after wave of Orcs in this funny fun filled highly addictive content packed Cartoony Action / Tower Defense / Strategy hybrid Indie game.
497	1	a	 This game is like Tower Defense except you get to be a part of it! A third person shooter game where you set up defenses to prevent trolls and other troll variety from getting too many to the exit. While you also shoot and stop them ontop of it! While trying not to get killed by them. Sad part is it's only Single Player, that's why I only play the second game with my friend.  9/10
499	1	a	6/10 It's a pretty dull Tower Defense game (replace Tower with Trap), but at least the opportunities grow with your inventory. Still, it's fun every now and then. But not as much fun as Plants vs. Zombies. *hint hint*
28	0	a	Spent about an hour with it. Read how good it was in the reviews but this got way too old way too fast. Bought it on a sale so it wasn't that big of a deal for a dollar. I've spent more on worse.
29	0	a	I emailed Robot Entertainment to report a bug in the game because some creatures didn't die when they landed in lava. They simply said to buy the sequel because they didn't want to release any more bug fixes. Avoid like the plague.
30	0	a	This is a great, really fun game. Do yourself a favor though and get Orcs Must Die 2. It has everything this game has (including most the maps) and a whole lot more.
31	0	a	That was a nice game but boring as hell. Sequel is much better.
32	0	a	Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.  The game has some very nice video's that hype the game up to levels if completely fails to reach when you finally start playing the game. And while this is not appearant at first. It slowly start sinking in after about 2 - 3 levels of this non-stop ogre killing.  To be honest, it's trying to be a tower-defence game but utterly fails at it as there are worse looking titles out there that are more fun and more challenging.  The game runs on most computers, looks nice, has some funny animations at times, but utterly fails at delivering any type of gameplay that was promised. Well, to correct myself, fails to deliver any type of gameplay that is FUN and was promised.  Recommandation is to go buy warcraft 3 and play tower defence there.  Rating 9 of 100
33	0	a	repetitive and boring
34	0	a	It's like Dugeon Defenders, But not fun
35	0	a	Original, Fast Paced and Damn Addictive.  All 3 describe this game to maximum precision. It is such a fun game, hours can be eaten away form your hands playing through the extensive single player campaign. It does lack the single most important thing that would make this game more fun.   Multiplayer.  Seriously, without it, this game is bland, you want to experience the Orc mayhem with your buddies. Skip this one, go for the sequel.  WompWompWommmmmp/10
36	0	a	It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2
37	0	a	Nah. It's not a terrible game, but it's clunky and awkward. Micro-managing the camera angle is half of what you'll do when playing. Go look for a better tower defense game.
38	0	a	Worst of money it just work for week &amp; its going to stop working people, this game is a mistake any mad man who buys orcs must dead is going to Acer of Yo any one who going this country Ok!!!!   :- v
39	0	a	ERROR:Failed to load 'shaders\FixedFunctionShaders.ShaderLib' Engine will not run.
40	0	a	Didn't do it for me at all. Part of the joy of tower defense is watching your little machine devour enemies. I didn't enjoy running around inside the machine in some kind of mediocre 1st-person shooter. This made the game less fun for me.
41	0	a	I'm not a huge fan of tower defense games to begin with, so meh. In this style, Dungeon Defenders was far more enjoyable.
42	0	a	Felt like this was more of a game to be played on my Smartphone then PC.  
43	0	a	I played a few hours and got bored.
44	0	a	Life is too short, Don't waste it.
45	0	a	Fun idea for a game but i'm finding it to be very glitchy. The opening cinematic freezes after about the fourth word the old man says and the third level refuses to load.
46	0	a	Definitely not one I'll play very often; but then I'm more about startegy &amp; tactics than brute force.
47	0	a	Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of like Torchlight II. You really need a pet or an ally to help you. This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings. It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything. I never could master the gameplay. The demo was fun to play. The rest of the game was a nightmare.
48	0	a	God dammit, you can't remap the keys AT ♥♥♥♥ING ALL. Even at the sale price, I want my ♥♥♥♥ing money back.
49	0	a	Unfunny; floaty and inaccurate gameplay; and forced mouse acceleration.
50	0	a	This game is all about killing orcs with traps, no big deal.
51	0	a	Poor controller support and lack of autofire made playing this game physically impossible for me.
52	0	a	Happy plus ONE.Less in an hour,think I'm not that naive.
53	0	a	Tedious garbage. I could have eaten at Arby's and been laid up with food poisoning for a week, and still have had a better time than I have with the time and money I have invested in this. I don't want a refund, I wish I had never played it.
54	0	a	☑ Nice TPS Defence Trap concept ☑ Good price (2€) in Biedronka Store  ☒ Only WSAD ☒ No Tutorial ☒ More shooter then Defence Tower ☒ Sanctum series are much much better then this one ☒ Very difficult
55	0	a	I hate this.
56	0	a	I like dugeon defenders better than this game
57	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
58	0	a	The sequel is better in every way possible. Avoid this.
59	0	a	While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.
60	0	a	buy number orcs must die 2 if you want to join friends
61	0	a	really fun game but i cant get past the first wave becouse  1: MY COMPUTER CANT LOAD THE PLAYED MODEL SO IM A FLOATING CROSS BOW 2: MY GAME CRASHES (sometimes even my computer) WHEN I CALL THE FIST WAVE 
62	0	a	This looked like it might be a good game. Bought it, and spent an hour in the menu trying to get it to work. Mouse won't show up no matter what I did. Tried every forum and fix I could find.  To bad. :/ 
63	0	a	Why continue to propagation of the wide misconception in our society that orcs are intrinsically evil and therefore must be slain. It is this kind of hatred propaganda that we need to have removed from our society and place out of reach of the impressionable minds of our youth.
501	1	a	Fun trap/tower defense type game Fast paced, easy controls, funny and engaging story line, without feeling too heavy. A great game to sit down and waste time playing and having fun, without having to make those long term commitments, and planning out your future needs for characters etc.
503	1	a	no funny one liner here, just a whole-hearted recommendation. buy this game. then, if you still havent had enough, buy the second one,.. but this one is better.
505	1	a	Very fun 3rd person tower defense game - plays out a lot like team fortress 2's MvM mode without the co-op. Just enough variation in the levels to keep it interesting and the option for nightmare mode with all of the unlocked upgrades boosts its replayability. Expect about 10 hours for the first run through and if you're a perfectionist, ample more after that on nightmare mode trying to obtain 5 skulls. Definitely recommended, especially since it can be founds cheap.
507	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a dating simulator based on actual events, about a guy who lives in a castle and joins a shady online dating service. He then spends the rest of his life attempting to interview these would-be green suitors to find the love of his life. Sadly, his dates often rush the gates and fall victim to the castle's insanely jealous defense system. It's up to our fair prince to use his trusty Crossbow of Love and his Sword of Choosing to place that special touch on the suitors that meet his fancy, and who aren't grieviously injured by the castle.  All in all, I found this to be a very tragic tale, as well as a cautious reminder of the horrors of online dating. It's also a really great game, even if you don't usually happen to like historical-based dating simulators.
509	1	a	Great combination of action and tower defense.
511	1	a	
513	1	a	It's a fast paced Dungeon Defenders with a little Sanctum mixed in. Reminds me of Dungeon Keepers (a really old game) where you get to make your own dungeons and set up traps. This has that same feel to it as you're essentially laying traps (some straight forward, others are interesting) and shooting/attacking the baddies before they make it to the end of the level. It's actually quite fun and I'd highly suggest to buy it even if you've already played DD and/or Sanctum a bunch. =3
515	1	a	I played this game through in fifteen hours. That's a bit short, but every hour was good fun. Definitely one of the most fun tower defense games I've tried.
517	1	a	Very fun with cheat engine. Im not a cheater. Cheat engine doesn't count
519	1	a	Fantastic game. Overwhelmingly positive critics are well deserved indeed. From all the games where killing is fun and creative, this is pretty much as good as it gets: OMD does not flatter finests instincts, but after over 2 gazillions of dead orcs, you may still find the resources to find it hilarious.
521	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this, but the price was right, so I bought it. Fantastic game. I bought the DLC as well, which is not like me at all. Loving the game so far.
523	1	a	Great game. Bought on steam sale so it was certainly a bargain. The keyboard can be rebound using a custom cfg - search online for directions.
525	1	a	Perfect blend of third-person action and tower defense. Plus, you get to kill thousands of Orcs. Seriously, F*ck Orcs. They are like wanna be Hulks, and are about as smart as the Jersey Shore crew.
527	1	a	Simply put, this game is huge amount of fun. It's an excellent blend of tower defense and action, with an almost comedic atmosphere. If you like hack &amp; slash and/or tower defense, I highly recommend you take a look at this game. Actually, I recommend picking up the franchise pack since both the first and second games are a blast to play.  Comparing this game with its sequel, I liked the levels better in general in this first game, but the second just has a lot more stuff including a second playable character with different traps and abilities, more monster types, and best of all, coop. So do yourself a favor and just get the franchise pack.
529	1	a	Very fun and challenging. A great choice if you enjoy strategy and tower defense.
531	1	a	Nice one.
533	1	a	Unique game. Totally worth the money and will suck you in.
535	1	a	Awesome tower defense style game - blast to play on the ground
537	1	a	Gameplay : easy Atmosphere : good A wonderful tower defense game
539	1	a	This is an immensely fun game that successfully blends frantic action with the need to pay attention to your environment and to plan ahead. It'sgood for hours of fun - pick it up as soon as you can!
541	1	a	The orcs must die, painfuly and at my pleasure.
543	1	a	The game is hilariously fun. Wanton destruction in the most tasteful way, a veg game without being a veg game.
545	1	a	If you have the money buy the game its amazing. Lots of games time trying to get a 5  skull rating on evrey level. If not at least try the demo for it.
547	1	a	You grin with malignant satisfaction as you watch the Horde of Orcs slog through tar, pelted by arrows, dying in scores, whilst their numbers are also gradually being decimated by wall mounted blades, crushed by crushers, knowing that, should one of the kobolds manage to survive this, the lava awaits.  (cue maniacal laughter)  MUHUHAHAHA...!
549	1	a	Great fun and a nice combination of strategicly planing your defense and bashing away orcs in direct combat.
551	1	a	Slice, dice, crush, smash, fling, shatter, stab and shoot all the orcs you can. How much better can it get?
553	1	a	Great! Pretty tempted to buy the second one too.
555	1	a	The only critism is the lack of some sort of multiplayer/Co-op. This game is awesome!!!!!!
557	1	a	Very fun and underrated game.
559	1	a	Try it In MasterMode thats a GAME! of slash slash and BOOM! HEADSHOT! really worht it!
561	1	a	One of the funnest Tower Defense games to be had outside of WC3 / SC2 mods.
563	1	a	This game is REALLY fun.
565	1	a	Great Game, the people who made Shadow of Mordor make they're own version!
567	1	a	This is probably my favorite iteration of tower defense, save for the sequel, because it takes what's too often a genre where it's an impersonal enemy grinder and forces you to be an active participant at all times. Combining traps is crazy fun when you get it right, and the game itself is irreverent in just the right doses to not be too winky or tiresome. Very solid, though the main campaign is almost a bit too long and difficult, and this game is hampered a little bit by the fact that the sequel surpasses it in a lot of ways, so if you're not looking to dive in too deep, just grab the sequel.
569	1	a	An entertaining and comedy-oriented trap dungeon defense game.  It took me a bit to get used to the trap difference vs the usual tower defense games I play - but it pans out well in a very entertaining, challenging and rewarding way. The traps set up have a limited area of effect and react on a reset timer for most of them, so its a mixture of combinations of traps and your own wits with weapons and the enviroment to pull it off well.  It proves to be a good game that is well worth its value.
571	1	a	Another hidden gem on Steam, bought for less than £3 it is terrific value for money. An interesting twist on the tower defence games (a firm favourite of mine) it sees you stopping orcs using an elabarate range of traps and defences. A great buy at a great price.
573	1	a	This is a good game to kill time with. Classic tower defense type of game.
575	1	a	The voice actor of the War Mage Apprentice (the player) in this game is Robert McCollum! He voice-acted Wataru Akiyama from the anime Initial D!  Oh My gosh this game is cool, one of the best tower defence games I've ever played, or even enjoyed for that matter.
577	1	a	Orcs Must Die's formula is simple, but what little it does it does very, very well and is a riot to play. The traps are a ton of fun to use and trap deaths look fantastic and satisfying. The later additions of simplistic spell trees and spells round the game up nicely and killing orcs was never this much fun xD. If you get into the competitive nature of the game you'll find out how surprisingly deep it is as customizing your character and traps and selecting the 'right' ones can greatly impact your final stage score and the speed at which you move and place your traps can mean all the difference.  8.5/10
579	1	a	Does what it says on the tin.
581	1	a	Fun game to play in between the deeper games. I would NOT pay $15 for it. Pick it up if it is on sale.
583	1	a	Even once you beat the game, it's loads of fun to play!
585	1	a	A lot of games try to blend tower defense and action-based gameplay. This is one of the few titles that actually pulls it off, with a quirky sense of humor to boot.  On the other hand, the game is rather short, and could use moddability and/or custom levels. Replayability is, accordingly, rather limited.
587	1	a	amazingly fun. very hard to put down
589	1	a	Pretty fun game. It's a tower defense game, but it's also a 3rd person action game. I do not like regular tower defense games, as they are all about setting up a defense and then waiting for the wave to end. In this one, you get to pick various weapons to fight off the enemies, while setting traps and defenses. Definitely give this game a try, and buy it if it goes on sale again!
591	1	a	Hello, Gamers.  Look at your Steam Library, now back to mine, now back at your Library, now back to mine. Sadly, yours isn't mine.  Why? Because if you stopped for a moment with all of your other games, you could be bisecting, stabbing, flaming and otherwise giving hordes of Orcs a very bad day, all while having an absolute blast of a time.  Okay, I'm horrible at copying Old Spice commercials... Orcs Must Die! is a game that describes itself right in its title, there's you, there's the Orcs, the latter must die. The fun is in how you have them die. The game is blindingly simple, the 'plot' is idiotically brilliant, and it's fun all around.  Kind of like Warhammer Fantasy.
593	1	a	Good stuff, well worth the money and a lot of fun. A new spin on tower defense.
595	1	a	I haven't played many tower defense games (TF2 playing as engineer counts, right?), but this is the only one I've played that I've actually enjoyed. Tower defense from third person action-game perspective. Good times
597	1	a	A neat game that I would recommend picking up on sale if you're looking at it. The overall quality is surprisingly polished and the game is challenging, particularly in Nightmare mode. Takes ~12 hours to complete in Normal mode and ~24 hours to complete in Nightmare mode.
599	1	a	With Orcs Must Die!, the game starts off slow and seems to get quicker and more faster paced as you gain experience and get access to more abilities. Graphics are nice in this game as well. It Does seem to get a bit tedious after a long while and the pace at which the orcs spawn and rush in increases.   If you do not have a lot of time to be able to play because of work, schooling or family schedules but would like to spend 15 min, 30 min or an hour just relaxing, I would recommend this game.   So overall this game is enjoyable, especially if you dont always have tons of time on your hands.
601	1	a	Hours of fun, recommend especially if you enjoy tower defense games.
603	1	a	Its a Nice TD With a twist. ITS SO FUNNY XD and mass killing is fun fun fun 
605	1	a	Very fun game, simple but great visuals. Tower defence-ish but with an 'in the field' style gameplay makes the challenge in running around to different areas of the map on foot to lay down traps as well as taking on the fight yourself with the orc horde. Very addicting with short levels that just keep comming one after another. Traps are varied as are the enemy types, fun to be had by all.
607	1	a	Fantasic mix of tower defense and shooter.  Great humor and wonderful story. A must for strategy fans looks for something new.  Highly recommended.
609	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a hell'o'va game. Its fun and frustrating, easy and challenging, you kick its ♥♥♥ or it will kick your ♥♥♥.   I totally recommend this game.
611	1	a	Brilliant game - really addictive!!! :)
613	1	a	Hilarious as hell, yet very challenging and rewarding, a must have if you like orcs chopped up!
615	1	a	Very addictive I love it !
617	1	a	It's a kind of game that you want to play it more and more! I also liked it because there is ranking system so I always try to win my friends. The best tower defense I've ever played...
619	1	a	I originally only got this for the Steam winter holiday achievement, but this game is one of the most original and clever I've seen in a while. It's pretty simple, but sometimes, that's just fine.
621	1	a	Great game, fun if you want to waste some time or blow some steam. Not serious at all, and tons of fun.
623	1	a	Quite fun game, but rather short. Beat the Normal difficult within 10 hours or so. Even then, the hardest difficulty proves very challenging and I can see beating it taking a lot longer. I'd give it a 85/100 or so, but if it's on sale, grab it for sure.
625	1	a	Are you a racist scumbag who believes orcs must die? If so, then buy Orcs Must Die!
627	1	a	Strangely addictive - and it's funny!
629	1	a	Surprisingly fun cross between Tower Defense style gameplay, Dungeon Keeper, and a first person shooter like Serious Sam.
631	1	a	First-person tower defense, similar to Sanctum, but less serious and more fun.
633	1	a	OH MY GOD. I didn't think that I was gonna enjoy this game as I'm enjoying it! I've seen a trailer once, and I thought it was an okay game. Now, I think this game is AMAZING! There are some cons to, but I think it's worth it! Any chance for a second one?
635	1	a	Better than tower wars!
637	1	a	
639	1	a	A rather fun and fast-paced 'trap defense' game. It can feel a bit repetitive over time, though.
641	1	a	A very entertaining tower defense game with a lot of action and a little bit of humor.
643	1	a	With a sequel on its way, giving the first a play is a must, tower defense, with a first person twist, presented with PERFECTION, bloody good game =D
645	1	a	It's a fun game, lots of ways to kill things!
647	1	a	This game is really fun! You start of with a funny intro comic thing giving you the story, and from then on it's orc slaying action! You unlock more traps with every level you beat resulting in more fun ways to kill the orcs! This game is a must have! 10/10
649	1	a	Recommended, a nice twist on the tower defence genre
651	1	a	pretty sweet game...to bad u missed out on the 75%off sale!
653	1	a	Great game - marries tower defence and third person shooter mechanics in a nice, polished package.   Recommended!
655	1	a	If you like tower defeance games its for you protect you portal from the ugly cretures!
657	1	a	You may think this game looks boring and is pretty one sided but the moment I saw the trailer this definately looked fun. And then I won the game and later bought the DLC on a sale.  This game is hilarious. I'm loving it. You pretty much have to fight against waves and waves of orcs but you get all these brilliant contraptions such as flip tiles, wall arrows, your own archers, floor spikes, explosive barrels so you can build up your defences and hold off against the enemy waves. It gets really challenging when you have a few entry points but if you think well and have a good defence structure, it's a breeze. Endless action, a very funny protagonist and visuals that make you feel like your in a cartoon, it's awesome. 9/10!
659	1	a	AWESOME. there really isn't another word for it. crazy addictive, fun, rewarding with a little bit of carnage thrown in. if you like the 'tower defense' type of games you're going to love this game. On top of that its crazy cheap for what you get. I highly reccomend it to everyone
661	1	a	Fun TD Game with orc's!
663	1	a	A fun game with a variety of interesting ways to make those orcs die.
665	1	a	One of the most addictive Tower Defense games out there! Packed with action, with a variety of traps, spells and weapons to dispose of the Orcish hordes. The game leaves it's tools in our hands and the result is immensely rewarding!
667	1	a	Quasi-Tower Defense meets Hack 'n' Slash in such a way thats incredibly fun. If you enjoy either genre to ANY degree, you're missing out if you don't get this game. It is amazing.
669	1	a	pretty fun little game, wish it was multiplayer
671	1	a	The nearly simultaneous release of this game and Dungeon Defenders has led to inevitable comparisons between the two games, and rightly so. Both games are Tower Defense games played on a personal level rather than a top down perspective. Both have the player control a character that can run the course of maps, place a number of defenses and traps, use different abilities and go toe to toe with the advancing mobs with melee and ranged weapons. The difference comes in the approach. Dungeon Defenders distributes the different abilities among different classes making the game virtually unplayable in single player especially if you’re playing a support class. Orcs Must Die has no multiplayer but gives all the abilities to one character with new abilities with each successful mission. Orcs Must Die also feels much more action oriented. If you’re looking for a good tower defense game that you can play by yourself, look no further than this game!
673	1	a	Welcome to customs, please follow the sparking lines here and here, they'll lead you to your death... filthy immigrants. Yet the game raises actual questions of modern society... it's still fun.
675	1	a	Everyone should check this out. Really great gameplay, really addicting and a lot of fun.
677	1	a	Really nice Tower Defense Game, that let's you take a very active fighting role, if you want! Don't make the mistake of thinking: 'meh, another TD game'!
679	1	a	I have to recommend this just based on the hilarious dance animations the main character does after clearing a stage. Great tower defense game.
681	1	a	I'm loving all these games that take the defense genre and make it a bit more interesting. So much so that I can't even call the category 'tower defense' any more.  Orcs Mus Die is a third-person shooter defense game. You lay traps for the orcs, then once they start coming, you use your sword and crossbow to kill the ones that get past the traps. Solid conttrols, good gameplay, quirky humor and an interesting spin on the genre.
683	1	a	A cross between a third-person shooter/Tower Defense game, it also features amusing dialogue and a lot of room for creativity. This game is a ludicrous amount of fun. Buy it, right now. No, seriously, buy it right ♥♥♥♥ing now.
685	1	a	Hilarious! A must buy for anyone who likes Bruce Campbell films or Duke Nukem!  The extra missions that you can buy are also good but lack the hilarious storyline and the new traps you get seem a bit too powerful.  The follow up game Orcs Must Die 2 is terrible! Don't waste any money on it.
687	1	a	Good game. Worth the 5$ I spent at the time. It'll get frustrating, though. Buy it for the lolz.
689	1	a	awesome fun cant wait for multiplayer on orcs must die 2
691	1	a	This game is fun! The combat is clunky, but very nice and meaty. The variety in enemies, traps and weaponry is also quite impressive. Also, it's a pretty good challenge. It is kinda repetitive, though, and the campaign will only really take you about 12-15 hours. For what you get, though, it's definitely worth the $10/£7.
693	1	a	A TD game with a FPS Element, slick controlls, fun houmor and great gameplay. Everything you want in a good TD/FPS combo.
695	1	a	Fantastic blend of action and Tower Defense. Best one I've seem in this genre yet. Can last very long if the player is at least a little bit perfectionist. Also, this game gets bonus points from me for not taking itself too seriously. It even comes packed with cheesy hurmor and a lovable goofy protagonist.
697	1	a	If you want to fight hordes of Orcs and can't afford Warhammer 40k then this is your game! this game is fun with an awsome soundtrack that causes cavities of the brain.
699	1	a	Most awesome tower defense game ever. There is a tough difficulty curve, but I've never felt cheated or forced into buying the DLC. In fact, I've beaten all the levels (even on Nightmare) without it. There is tons of replay value with this game due to the sheer number of weapons and traps and maps available.   I love this game from the humor to the artwork to the gameplay.  The only thing I felt it was lacking was co-op, something that the second game brings in.
701	1	a	A simple action game about fighting hordes and lasting in a contention zone (a la Delta 8 Nova Prospekt in Half Life 2), with the twist of putting a lot of crazy defenses. A game for only fun and laughs, but that usually enough for a great time.
703	1	a	Very easy to get into. EXTREAMLY FUN! As casual games go there few that can offer you this much fun. Killing the hordes of orcs and vile creatures that storm your castles never gets old. The maps gets very interesting as you move truought the campaign and your unlocked traps and upgrades are persistent so you can use them all the time anywhere.  ORCS MUST DIE  MUST BUY!
705	1	a	I got this on a whim a few weeks back. It's one of the best tower defense games that I have ever played, hands down. Great voice acting. Humorous story. Tight controls. Excellent gameplay. A worthy addition to any steam library.
707	1	a	Hilariously fun.
709	1	a	Orc stomping fun!
711	1	a	Great fun game! If you enjoy Tower Defence games, then you will like this!
713	1	a	This game was the reason I came back to steam after four years of not using it. It's an absolute blast! It's a mix of Tower Defense and First Person Shooter with some good comedy thrown in. It's a must-play for any Tower Defense fans.
715	1	a	Orcs Must Die: a Haiku  I shoot the orc dead.  I burn, crush, smash, throw, and stab.  I know: Orcs must die!     10/10 Would load up to shoot orcs again....stupid orcs.
717	1	a	This game is great!!!
719	1	a	co-op 1st person tower defense with a sense of humor, very well executed, does all it says on the tin, a great game
721	1	a	A unique twist in the tower defense genre, charming character design and personality, amazing gameplay and it's just too damn fun to play. Buy this now
723	1	a	You dont always find a mix gendered tower defense so well done.
725	1	a	Possibly one of the greatest tower defence games i have ever played.
727	1	a	Does not suck, much fun had by myself and others.
729	1	a	No orcs were hurt in the making of this game - oh, wait...
731	1	a	Kill orcs.
733	1	a	'I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.' a lot of fun with these game
735	1	a	Incredibly fun! It's plants vs. zombies on overdrive! Set your traps and watch the fun!
737	1	a	I have never been the biggest fan of Tower Defense games. But after playing a good 7 hours of Orcs Must Die over the last 2 days, I can honestly say that this title gets a spot on my favorites list. Robot Entertainment has produced a challengeing, trhrilling, laugh out loud chaotic little gem. Nothing quite equals the satisfying feeling of frantically rushing around, strategically lining the corridors of a fortress with implements of death, and then watching your assailants fall in droves under hails of arrows, floor spikes, wall blades, and brimstone tiles. The 3rd person over the shoulder camera puts you smack in the middle of the chaos, immediatley lending the game a sense of urgency you don't feel in other TDG's simply because your character's life is in peril because your character is THERE. Humor, depth, and white knuckled pacing set the tone for a well made, fun game that is worth picking up. (Especially at such a low price.)
739	1	a	It was fun killing endless waves of orcs thats all there is to say. 
741	1	a	Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   Awesome single-player 'tower defense' (change 'tower' to 'trap'), very polished, balanced, real pure fun and very charming characters.
743	1	a	Charming.  8/10, would get thrust awkwardly into a position of overwhelming responsibility again.
745	1	a	A Tower Defense pretty fun recommanded if you like that style of game !
747	1	a	A simple game with loads of fun and a whacky style. The title says it all ;-)
749	1	a	I absolutely love this game! It clearly did not have a huge budget. There are no super expensive intros and the graphics are rather simple (but effective and not bad in any way). But it is the concept that is so much fun. Building traps for the Orcs to run into and get killed in the most hillarious of ways is incredibly satisfying. The dialogue and voice acting are well done. The music fits the theme (but is a bit repetitive). The animation is great. The story is funny. The hero is likeable. My only critique would be that it is a bit short if you paid the full price. It feels like the game only just started when it is already over. You really want to make use of the last few types of traps more often before the game ends. And I never really got to ues the Weavers that much either (there never really is that much money). I wished there had been more levels to explore this upgrade mechanic and the last few traps a bit more.  Because of its shortness, best wait until it is on sale.  8 out of 10
751	1	a	Before I had my own steam account, I played this game all the time on my brother's account. I loved playing this game, endless upon endless hordes of orcs slaughtered at the hands of an 8 year old.
753	1	a	Frantic, hectic fun. Nothing is more fun than watching you trap layout eat up orcs like a well oiled machine. Oiled with Blood.
755	1	a	8/10  A great tower defence game, with the addition of an FPS side it makes for a great game.  Making traps for orcs is great, the difficulty isnt overly hard, theres a wide range of weapons, levels and traps to keep the game interesting.  Worth a pickup.
757	1	a	I'm a little surprised about liking this game. Usually I'm not big on action type games, but I found myself enjoying the mix of action and strategy. Placing the traps correctly is a major part of the game, but wading into a bunch of orcs breaking thru your defenses is the icing on the cake.  I'm not far into the game yet and have found the dificulty to be hit or misss on the levels. Some seem really hard, but the next level is very easy. I can see myself finishing the game as long as the last few levels don't go over the top in difficulty.  Overall a game worth playing, especially if you catch it on sale.
759	1	a	Awsome game, puts dungeon defenders to shame even without the multiplayer.
761	1	a	really a lot of fun if you like tower defence/shooter/'strategy' games
763	1	a	very fun and very addicting if you love tower defense games and first person advencture/action games this is the game for you as it takes both those genres and blends it into awesome
765	1	a	Castle defense for the sole sake of Orc bashing fun. It's entertaining.
767	1	a	Good fun... easy to understand and many hours of enjoyment
769	1	a	Good combination of tower defence, strategy and action. The levels are great and doesn't get me bored. I also recommend playing Orcs must die 2!.
771	1	a	before I was a lad i killed the orkish folk.
773	1	a	i hate tower defence games, but this game is amazing.  this is the best tower defence game ever made, hands down.  the goal is simple, keep enemies from getting from point a to point b. you use elements to help you do such, like place and remove all sorts of different traps that do all sorts of different things. use all sorts of different weapons and spells/magic.  if you have never played or seen this game before, buy it. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  i have over 1000+ games that i own and play...not to mention games ive owned in the past on consoles. this is by far in my top 3 favorites, maybe even number 1.  so even if you are like me, and hate tower defence games, give this a try.
775	1	a	So first off, got this game during a Steam Sale for cheap, didn't think I would like it. Boy was I wrong! Finished the first game in a good amount of time, got addicted, bought the second one NOT on sale, finished that one too. Excellent game mechanics, gameplay is smooth on my rig, and I really enjoyed the humour and storyline. All in all 10/10
777	1	a	Awesome tower defence game. lots of fun and very original.
779	1	a	Pretty fun tower defence with comical story.
781	1	a	This is honestly one of the funnest games i have EVER played. A smart man with $15.00 would buy it. Good story, GREAT gameplay. Awesome visuals. This game is a 10/10 in my book. Will be buying any sequals.
783	1	a	I'm a big Bloon Tower Defense player, so I thought that I had the end all of tower defense games on my iphone already. Oh how wrong I was. This is a great tower defense game, with a nice bit of hack-and-slash thrown in. I'm about halfway through the first act ( I think) and while some towers I have now seem to serve no purpose, and although I keep picking them when I first get them (eg steam trap without a combo for it) I'm sure later in the game they'll have a great combo (certain trap seem to be designed to be put together).  The only thing I wish is that I could choose from any trap/weapon whenever I want, instead of picking and choosing a certain amount at the start of a round. It's just something I'm used to from playing Bloons, but I've gotten over it already. Thats part of the challenge.  I'd give this a 8/10
785	1	a	Awesome mix between Tower Defense games and action/RPG game (not that RPG-ish though)
787	1	a	This game is so dam fun it really challanges you too think outside the box and can be a little crazy with weapons
789	1	a	Great game. Addictive tower defense style-game with a decent amount of variation between weapons, towers, maps, and mobs. Recommend for any tower defense lover.
791	1	a	Put down some traps and rip thousands of orcs apart in this awesome game. Not exactly tower defence, but its something similar.
793	1	a	It is a good game, but you should skip it and go to #2.
795	1	a	Woo! I love tower defense!
797	1	a	Finally, a high budget TD! And it kicks a$$!
799	1	a	Really love the mix of tower defense and action :) And the humor makes it pretty funny. If you have seen the trailer of the game and you are hyped, then i most definatly recommend this game :D
801	1	a	Incredibly fun, but takes a little while to get into. At first it seems like you just plow away with your crossbow, but it quickly becomes about strategy. Very entertaining graphics and physics. Gameplay is very fun, and yet still challenging. I highly recommend this game if you're into Tower Defense games.  Other games like this are Sanctum (1 and 2) and Dungeon Defenders. All of these are great games, and the FPS/TPS slash Tower Defense genre really needs more games.
803	1	a	A new twist on tower defense games and I feel like it's the best out there. Great diffculity
805	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a critically acclaimed mix between acion adventure and tower defense. The game has some beautiful artwork, a vast amount of weapons and traps, and most importantly a band of lovable over the top characters. Although it is a large amount of fun to play I will say that not once on my playthrough did I think 'Wow I've never seen anything like this before' and that ends up being a fatal flaw of the game, however that does not make it a bad game. If you're in the mood for a lovable and charismatic adventure similar in spirit to a game like Borderlands then look no further. I would give Orcs Must Die a solid 7/10
807	1	a	It's an enjoyable tower defense game with a good amount of humor. Gameplay is intuitive and fun with unique abilities allowing for creative 'deaths.'
809	1	a	Great game. Killing the orcs, ogres and the other momsters is fun using the variety of weapons, spells and traps. yeye! I have such good high scores too yeye!!!
811	1	a	Pros: +music +dialoge +so much orcs to kill +lot of traps, multiple ways to beat same levels +3 build paths in lategame +storyline &amp; main character Cons: -short (took 7 hours to complete and I think it's not the fastest time out there) -some levels were too easy to complete when other were somewhat challenging (last 3 maybe)
813	1	a	Very refreshing combo of Tower Defense, Hack and Slash and a tiny bit of RPG. The style's also very cool. Orc-hating cartoonish stuff. Looks great
815	1	a	An excellent game, it combines tower defense with action...Thumbs up!!!
817	1	a	Single-player FPS Tower Defense Game. Pick it up when on sale. Easy fun!
819	1	a	Great twist on tower defense! Funny too!
821	1	a	good if you want a timekiller
823	1	a	awesome tower defence based game.
825	1	a	For me this is the best first person / tower defense hybrid there is. Beats Sanctum IMO. Set the Standard.
827	1	a	Orcs must Die! is a third person action Tower defense game and probably the best when its about the gameplay. You play as a War Mage who needs to defend Gates from ugly Orcs. To do this task you can use Traps and Weapons as well as some envoirmental stuff.   The Gameplay is pretty straight forward. The first Wave and every 5 Waves you have unlimited Time to decide what to Build. Between each other wave you have a time limit until the next wave starts. You can purchase Traps with money. You get money for killing Orcs and you get even more money if you kill Orcs with more than one Trap. The trick is to get as many traps on one place as possible. You need of course something to fight for yourself. For that you can use a magical crossbow that can shoot bolts very fast or a Sword. You can also use magical items to shoot fire or ice and with the DLC you get some interesting items like a pot full of acid which you can throw on the orcs to kill loads of orcs with one attack. All items have a secondary attack that uses mana (In case of the Acid pot it always costs mana to balance it). You can refill your mana at the Gate that you need to defend. Or you can use a magical contraption that refills your mana if you stand next to it. Later in the game you get the wavers, which sell upgrades if you have a spare coin for them.   The grafics are nothing special but the artstyle is great. I always considered that the artstyle is more important than the grafics of a game and Orcs Must Die! is the best example for that. The medival comic look fits nicely with the theme of the game.  The Soundtrack is pretty good. It is mostly medival rock music and fits perfect to the artstyle and the Gameplay.    If you like or dont like this review than please tell me why. If there are grammar problems in the text please let me know.
829	1	a	Definitely one of the coolest tower defense-like games. It didn't take long before the levels started getting a little more difficult (in terms of trying to achieve all 5 skulls per level). There's also a Nightmare mode that is even more difficult.
831	1	a	If you win, you feel good having beaten up derpy orcs. If you lose, you feel good watching the over confident main character die. You can't lose unless you don't buy.
833	1	a	A great game if you have a cheap laptop, trying to perfect it is addicting.
835	1	a	Started playing because I got this as a gift from my friend. CAN'T STAHP PLAING. I THINK I HAVE ORC-BOLA PLES SOMEONE HELP ME! (This game is amazing, in a shortened version of those last couple of sentences. lol, good game, guys!)
837	1	a	A frighteningly addictive game with a real sense of humour, the DLC is a sharp learning curve but the whole game is masses of fun
839	1	a	Picked this up at 75% off for the steam achievement for the holidays, but quickly ended up spending an hour in it. And then another... and another. The game is just really clean and does what it sets out to do really well. This puts a ton of creativity back into the bland 'tower defense' style genre and plays to different strengths. If you're confident with a crossbow or a sword, you can dump money and items into improving that. If your trap strategy is top notch, dump all your money into a maze of tricks and traps designed to do only one thing; Kill. All. The Orcs.  Would have paid full price if I knew what I was getting into. It's got great gameplay, a smooth engine, just the right dash of humor and a lot of things to kill in a bunch of different ways. And if you ever find yourself with nothing to do, scratch your chin at the leaderboards and fine tune your strategy to not only survive the orcs - but kill them efficiently and brutally.
841	1	a	Great fun for a few bucks, Probably shortlived but who cares for 10 euro? 1001 ways to kill a orc, you can probably find more :D
843	1	a	Bought for achievement in Orcs Must Die! 2, but now i think its much better for single player. It is a shame there is no co-op version for this game, but i still reccomend it!
845	1	a	The fact that, with all the games I could be playing at this point, I've been going back to this one repeatedly to finish a new level, says a decent amount about it alone. I love classic Tower Defense style games, which this most resembles, and it does those parts well. Even if it was just setting the traps and watching the Orcs gib, that would probably be enough, but the FPS aspects (with which you can win without setting a trap at all on some levels) and are also well done and fun to use or (as I tend to do) supplement your traps by stunning orcs in range.
847	1	a	Very fun and well made tower defense!
849	1	a	You know, the condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip it on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, then you throw it away. The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
851	1	a	
853	1	a	Great gameplay, a lot of humour and very interesting concept of a game.
855	1	a	There are sooo many ways you can complete the levels, I'm almost done finishing the game on hardest difficulty. Its lots of fun and i recommend it to everyone who likes a challenge but doesn't want days and days of content before finishing the game.
857	1	a	AWESOME game but it's a little short finished it on 5 hour's ;D 
859	1	a	I did the happy dance when i first played this game. Do you wanna do the happy dance?
861	1	a	If you're a tower defence/wave defence fan and enjoy ridiculous humour then I couldn't recommend this more. Sequel coming out soon - worth grabbing this before it does!
863	1	a	A whole lot of manic fun, you wont mind how repetative it actually is under its shiny cell-shaded surface and you will have completed it several times long before you ever wanna stop playing it.  One of those games that Does Exactly What It Says on the Tin  Orcs Must Die!  4/5 (mash em, boil em, stick em in a stew.)
865	1	a	Challanging game! but a really nice tower defense!!! RECOMMENDE!!!
867	1	a	Fun game. can't say much for replay value as I didn't try to play it again ever. still worth one play through.
869	1	a	Tower defense game that's just straight up FUN.
871	1	a	I got a recommendation for this game, I RECOMMEND that you just forget it exists because it's the worst pile of doo doo butter that has ever stained itself upon the steam library. Every time I think of this game I want to vomit until I die. Final Score: 8/10
873	1	a	Grandslam Homerun for me. Tower Defense concept, humor, graphics, music, and sound are all top notch. I buy and try a lot of games -- this and Defense Grid 2 are far and away the best. Not even close. Other games are just dull right now.
875	1	a	I love this and the sequel. I love building, placing and managing the traps and seeing the mayhem happen and knowing where to assist the traps just constantly improving my 'dungeon'.
877	1	a	That's just too much fun for 4 bucks.
879	1	a	If you love trap games + tower defense, or just miss the old 'Dungeon Keeper' franchise, this is one game you should not miss playing! 'Hands-on' Dungeon Keeper!
881	1	a	Only bought this due to being cheap... would have paid full price. Super addicting
883	1	a	Good game, gotta kill those orcs!
885	1	a	So much fun playing it. recommend game to play
887	1	a	For The Following People Who Is Not A Tower Deffence Game Fan Then Don't Bother Being Negative Because People Like Me Are Fans Of Tower Deffence Games And It Mkaes Me Mad When People Thinks Its ♥♥♥♥ But Clearly They Are Not TD Fans So Grow Up And Move On  I Understand Its Your Opinion Everyone Is Aloud An Opinion But Your Only Saying Your Reasons From Your Perspective
889	1	a	Love the game. Keep up the good work :)
891	1	a	One of the best games in 2011, I recommend!
893	1	a	The first 3 levels were boring as hell, and should have been a 'tutorial'. After that it got much better.  It's ultimately a Tower Defense game, but the 3rd Person Shooter perspective makes it more fun. Being able to fight manually gives something extra to do between placing traps, and gives you a nice perspective to watch all the orcs die.
895	1	a	First off: Play this, even if its just the demo; don't be fooled by how easy the demo is --this game gets fairly difficult pretty quickly. And when you finish the story mode, you unlock Nightmare Mode, which involves hard versions of every level with more, tougher enemies, next-to-no downtime between waves, and no breather 'Unleash the Horde!' events. Great art, fantastic gameplay, witty dialogue. Completely worth its low price point.
897	1	a	one comment were mentioning that game as  'hidden gem'  ought to buy now 'hidden gem 2' 
899	1	a	It is a relly fun game ^-^
901	1	a	Great Game!!
903	1	a	I bought the franchise pack and debated starting with the 2nd game or the first. I decided to start with the 1st one. I love it, I found my self thinking about different strategies at work even :) I like to use different strategies all the time, so I never just stick to one. It is easy to beat this game using only 1 type of strategy but the fun lies in tinkering about.  Stability: 8/10 - can hang for extended periods of time during loading screens Art: 9/10 - Suits the atmosphere of the game and is consistent through out Sound: 8/10 - Fits the mood the game tries to portray. Fire crossbow sound get's messed up if you strafe shoot. Gameplay: 9.5/10 - fluid and responsive, a joy to play. One downside is that orc attacks will hit you even if you are out side their attack animation. Story: 4/10 - interesting potential but is very sparse and lacks any detail Replayability: 9/10 - I love going back to get higher combo's and 5 skulls  If, like me, you bought both games, start with the first 1, it's extremely fun and the story does carry over to the 2nd game
905	1	a	This is a great game and I am really enjoying playing it. It's basically a FPS &amp; Tower Defense game. Your job is to prevent the orcs from reaching the rift. If too many do, you lose the level.  The orcs come at you in 'waves' and you have different ways of defending yourself. From traps to extra support (guardians). The key to success in the game is choosing the right traps in the level as well as placing them strategically.   
907	1	a	sauron hates this game
909	1	a	I got this on sale for less than the price of a piece of cheese at the local convenience store.  Pros: For a game released in 2011 the graphics are still holding up strong Solid Third Person Shooter/Tower Defense game with a challenge that doesn't feel intimidating. Simple, fun, seemingly arcade style gameplay. Music is basic, appropriate, and not annoying. Better than cheese, and I really like cheese.  Cons: I waited to long to find out that Orcs Must Die! I still want a piece of cheese.
911	1	a	A Very addictive game from where I have played it. The controls are simple and the maps are different and fun. A must-have
913	1	a	this is a great tower defense game. good music, maps are quite challenging, many weapon (I missed the gunbow when moved to Orcs must die 2), traps ....and interesting winning pose.
915	1	a	-Addicting Gameplay  -Nice Creature -I Like Cartoonize graphics Video games -Its Extended Verison of PvZ garden warfare maybe ;)
917	1	a	Killing orcs is so much fahn.
919	1	a	
921	1	a	This game is a fun tower defense game, because not only you build things to defend but you can control and customize your character on how you defend the stage, the stages are challenging and different in variety. I like the cartoonish graphics and the very comedic vibe that it has. For over all verdict I'd say that this game is fun and challenging, and I would like to recommend it to everyone.
923	1	a	After playing some OMD Unchained I decided to replay the first one and it's still as good as I remember. Sure, the second one has more stuff, a more interesting upgrade system, 2 player co-op and is overall the better game but the first one is still fun.  It has a better feel to kill orcs than Unchained and the progression pacing is more fluid. Maybe not worth the 10 bucks anymore as OMD2 is out for years but owning OMD1 gets you 10 extra levels in OMD2 so alone for this it's worth at least the sale price.
925	1	a	Pretty nice game if you have little time. :)
927	1	a	It has great replayability You have to constantly re-think best strategy to pass the level and to maximize the number of skulls It has several improvements on magic, devices as you level up Story is fun and is refreshing to hear the funny comments with those voices. It doesnt stuck me to the computer hour after hour,because passing each level is so rewarding that  I can play one level and have all the fun that I need for a long time in which I can work , talk with my family and other everyday thing  It a simply superb game , dont count the hours you can waste on it but all the satisfaction you will have with it
929	1	a	Best TD there is.
931	1	a	Hands down the most fun I've ever had playing a tower defense game. Got this on sale for $0.99 and it is definitely worth every penny!
933	1	a	At first glance of hearing a third person tower defense threw me of, made it think it wasnt worth my time, as soon as i bought due to the sale i know its worth the full price itself. the total destruction of orcs is amazing.
935	1	a	I normally hate tower defense games but this one is amazing!
937	1	a	very fun if you are fun of games like ballon tower defence and all that 
939	1	a	love this game TD &amp; TPS Shooter= Exelent game Bravo
941	1	a	I think this game is not only strategy but also need a speed to click your mouse to defeat the ORCS
943	1	a	Very cool and good planned TD action/game
945	1	a	Many Orcs died making this game.
947	1	a	actually amazing, I thought it might be basic garbage but the story is nice, the main character is fun, it feels really good to watch him get down when you get a perfect score, it is actually very well made and thought out and I loved it, some of the traps were stupid useless but all of them were pretty dam cool
949	1	a	Lot's of fun. I enjoy it a lot.
951	1	a	Just bought this game on sale for $3.74, and it was worth it. I've only played 10 minutes to get a christmas achievement, and I want to play more. Headshots are so easy, and killing orcs is pretty fun!
953	1	a	Very addictive, gotta beat those top scores.
955	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun. A bit short, I finished the game in about two days. Orcs Must Die! Definitely has the best twist on tower defense: third person.
957	1	a	The RPG!
959	1	a	Kill some orcs
961	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very nice take on the tower defense genre. Seeing as I only played through the Single Player portion of the game and on Warmage difficulty my review will be based on that.  The game starts out with a short cinematic of an old archmage who meets his untimely demise at the hand of some stairs. As he falls Orcs are about to storm the portals into our world with one last obstacle in their way, the archmage his terribly unskilled apprentice, you.  Throughout the campaign the game slowly expands your arsenal of weapons and traps that you can use to slaughter the oncoming horde as they attempt to break through. At no point are you overwhelmed with choice or are you left with few options on how to handle a given situation.  While some strategies are more effective in certain situations you are always free to take the hard path. The difficulty level is not too high in this game and greatly depends on your preffered play style. Once I developed a certain preffered trap combo I found myself using it over and over with great effect until certain maps came along where the combo was entirely useless forcing me to adapt my playstyle.  The only shortcoming in this game is that while the difficulty is okayish in most levels there are certain spikes that can come as a complety suprise and force you to figure out some mechanics without being informed about them so this might be frustrating for some players who prefer to casualy walk through a game.  The only noticeable bugs I encountered were with flying enemies going straight through walls in some stages and in another some enemies managed to get stuck at the bottom of an acid swamp without dying. Overal these encounters were few and once you were aware of the possibility of them occuring not all that problematic.  Overal score of 8/10, Would totally recommend this to fans of the genre.
963	1	a	Orcs must die is a tower defence game and third person shooter wrapped up into one.  The plot is as simple as it gets. There are two worlds, our world, and the orc world (insert warcraft joke here). They are connected by rifts, which allow travel between the two worlds, and for magic to flow into both worlds. An order has been set up to protect these rifts at all costs, using massive forts filled with traps to stem the hordes. You are a thick beefcake trained by the best old man the order had, before he died, it is your task to defend the rifts and keep back the hordes.  The meat of the game is wave based tower defence, where in you spend mana to set up defences along lanes in order to protect the rift from any nasties trying to get through. You yourself are loaded with weapons as well which allow you to take an active roll in the defence of the rift. You have a set amount of slots with which to select your tools of death and are locked into those until the end of the level. Weapons and traps both take up a single slot, so choose wisely.  Its a difficult but extremely satisfying process, going through each wave and being careful with how you plan everything out, from basic trap set up to the shooting mechanics, every enemy is dealt with in a slightly different way, with no true stratagy to perfectly stop the incoming hordes, you're always moving, always setting up new traps, always doing something. Its chaotic, but rarely overwhelming to the point where its impossible to handle right up until the end when you've failed to make the optimal trap set up somewhere or haven't been active enough in your own personal combat against the creeps.   Visually the game is very cartoonish, everything is very clean and it goes well with the cheesy comedy aspect, really hammering home the fact the game is light hearted, which is fine. The music scores, while not the greatest pieces, are memorable and even weeks later i can perfectly remember the main theme, i personally found them fantastic, but your tastes may differ.  The game overall was a wonderful experience from start to finish, being one of the most addictive games i've ever played in my life, and it was also the first game i ever played on PC, forever bringing me into the folds of the PC master race. I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fast paced tower defence game, or third person shooter with heavy focus on not doing all the work by yourself.
965	1	a	Very addicting game, well made, good for killing time.
967	1	a	Mega funny game to burn hours of time into, highly reccommended!
969	1	a	This is a great example of how to combine action and tower defense gameplay.  Gameplay is very fun; the variety of weapons and traps gives you plenty of ways to complete most levels. However, some traps/weapons need to be upgraded before they're useful IMO.  The art style, soundtrack and story (what little story there is) are all fun and upbeat, and make a very fun atmosphere. The little amount of dialogue is gold, too.  Nightmare mode is exactly what is says on the tin.  Absolutely recommended.
971	1	a	A good game.I like it so much...i want to buy the Orcs must die 2.
973	1	a	Orc and goblin oh my this is a fun tower defense game
975	1	a	Few games are tight and cohesive as OMD. The presentation is perfectly suited to the game mechanics.
977	1	a	 Spike reviews his 100%-ed games    In one sentence…
979	1	a	Great fun. I enjoy the main character's wisecracks. And slicing, dicing, skewering, burning, flinging, and exploding Orcs never gets dull!
981	1	a	Really enjoyed it. Incredibly addcitive. Its nice to see that the ex-ensemble guys are still doing good work. If you like third person action or tower defense you should pick it up. its only 15 bucks. totally worth the buy.
983	1	a	Def a game I would recommend getting if you like RTS.
985	1	a	Great game, only wish it it had more levels and mutiplayer support. Very satisfying to setup a great defense and watch the orcs get slaughtered.
987	1	a	Fun. Addicting. Fun achievements and significant skill level changes increase replay value.
989	1	a	Fun in that it becomes addictive, and you get satisfaction out of getting your fix.
991	1	a	Not as good as the first.
993	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is one of those really great indie-titles that deserves more attention than it has got. Sure the second game is way better, but nonetheless the first game rocks too! A first-person tower defence, Orcs Must Die! finds the perfect balance between tactical setups and mindless killing action. The game becomes quite challenging later - which can be good for some I bet. I, for one, can have a hard time controlling the battlefield, when enemies swarm from every side.  The designs of traps, levels and enemies are classic, but great, and the game offers hours of fun. The variety of traps are remarkable, and fighting alongside your tactical setup is a great way of playing this kind of game. Though the game lacks co-op, which thankfully has been addressed in the sequel.  DIE!!! .... After you have bought the game.
995	1	a	Very fun game for the first 2 hours, then the difficulty falls off a cliff and most people stop playing. I've been back to push through a few times but the novelty is gone. A good buy, just know ahead of time that you will probably only get 2-3 hours gaming from it.
997	1	a	I found the game pretty addictive. It's a tower defense game with a wide variety of traps and weapons to choose from. Negotiate with orcs? No! Orcs Must Die!
999	1	a	Orcs Must Die!   That's a pretty dumb name.   Although I ended spending way too much time on this silly little game. Orcs Must Die would fall in the 'Tower Defense' Genre but it has so many different twists. Firstly being, there's a pretty funny story and hilarious characters. You not only make traps, you also run around with a sword or gun or frost magic and fight as well. It's entirely possible to win the game without a single trap. It's also entirely possible to win without a single sword swing but both would be incredible difficult. I loved wasting time on this game.
1001	1	a	BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
1003	1	a	Totally nuts. If you like tower defense and/or action games, this game is for you. Not much story in it, but hey! Who needs a story, if you can build all kinds of traps and participate in the action?
1005	1	a	Pretty Cool Tower Defence! Its a little bit challenging i love that!Can't wait to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
1007	1	a	Tower defense with humor and an attitude. The music keeps pumping, orcs keep coming and you have a growing arsenal of traps and weapons to keep them at bay. Lots of fun!
1009	1	a	very fun its a must buy
1011	1	a	Its been years since ive played a game as entertaining as this!! the large amount of traps(allowing many combinations) and the large variation of fortresses(where in each you can find a certain advantage) allows one to play them over and over,another bonus is that every trap you unlock and every upgrade you buy is persistant so you can go to an earlier level to experiment with the new traps. the 'Nightmare' difficulty also picks up nicely where the war-mage dificulty ends. this game is all about making facing hordes of orcs fun and they have done a excellent job with that!!  the Quotes that the orcs spill are also funny. the Normal difficultty campaign took me about 8 hours to complete.
1013	1	a	good 3rd person tower defence
1015	1	a	This is one of the best action tower defence games I have played. really fun traps and combos and freedom to run around fighting makes this a nice gem. lack of multiplayer or co-op is the only bad thing, but even solo is still alot of fun
1017	1	a	Play the first one, tons of fun. Do NOT buy the second one, omg snooze-fest almost immediately. Complete and utter sequel fail. So crushingly dissappointed.
1019	1	a	I know it's not a new game, but like way to many games these days, the inability to customize you input settings really limit the playability...  Fortunately I got this as a part of a humble bundle or I would have been rather upset with it... At the very least include a way to set inverse mouse in the menu..
1021	1	a	What I learned from this game: Orcs can get pierced, slashed, crushed, burnt, frosted, exploded, desintegrated ... and the really nice cartoony graphics make this look even funny. Recommended!
1023	1	a	ORCS MUST DIE! Kil them how u want!
1025	1	a	By far the most entertaining and inventive ego-shootish game I have played in the last couple of years.   Players having a knack for frantic, challenging, but nevertheless highly strategic action, HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY.
1027	1	a	Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time. Whatever your approach, an orc's pain is your gain. You must download, because Orcs Must Die.
1029	1	a	A very fun game. It's kind of like Sanctum but with a fantasy setting instead of a science fiction setting. Build traps, unleash the horde and kill waves of orcs with your crossbow/sword and the traps you've build. At first I thought it was a little easy, but obviously the further you progress teh harder the levels become. I recommend this game to everyone that likes towerdefense-shooter hybrids. The only downside is the lack of multiplayer, but that's what Dungeon Defenders is for I guess.
1031	1	a	This game's a blast. Overall, it's more of a 'management' type of game rather than ur basic hack-n-slash. Bonus are the little funny comments from the orcs whenever they start attacking. Even for an old game, it's still fun.
1033	1	a	Orcs Must Die! That is all that is to be said about this game it is amaze balls
1035	1	a	The best game where you play a Bruce Campbellian jockhead wizard hero and fight orcs in a 3rd person shooter tower defense game.
1037	1	a	Loved Orcs Must Die! So much fun and very satisfying setting up your traps for the orcs. Can be quite challenging in parts. Really looking forward now to Orcs Must Die! 2...
1039	1	a	This is just dirty, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fun. Gotta think, gotta react, and most of all - gotta stay calm. Definitely worth the lucre.
1041	1	a	One of the most helarious tower defence games I’ve played. I do very much enjoy this genre and orcs must die does shine as one of the best. Even though the gore and the graphics design is 'cartoony'; mowing down the hord with well placed traps or jumping into the frey with a meele weapon is still extremely satisfying. The humor is well done but taylored for younger players with reasonably subtle hints to more adult subjects. The plot is simple but entertaining non the less. The maps can be quite fendish but once you work out the best arrangement it all falls into place and you can work on that high score.
1043	1	a	Fast, fun and easy to pick up.
1045	1	a	Totally addictive, very easy to start, but after a while it starts to test your skills. It's a very fun game to play, really worth the price  100 out of 100 of course ;)
1047	1	a	Holy crap this game is addicting. Now at the time of writing this recommendation, I haven't beaten it yet...BUT...man this game is just sooooo good. It's just...cuz...like....URRRGGHH! Tower defense gameplay, with third person shooter gameplay. GReAT mix. The graphics are awesome, sound/music is great, and level design hits the sweet spot. You've GOT to get this game. I was able to get this when it was on sale and MAN what a steal that was. HIGHLY recommend this game. Lot's of fun ^_^
1049	1	a	Who doesnt love killin' orcs? This game is amazing! i really recommend this to all people who like fighting in generally  You will love this game  
1051	1	a	Gotta love mass genocide! Set the language to German to get the full experience.
1053	1	a	Gameplay is similar to tower defense games, but instead of towers, you defend rifts. You prevent orcs from crossing the rifts by setting up traps AND fighting them using your crossbow/blade/spells (3rd Person). You can also customize your warmage (minor spoiler) by using the weavers, which give specific boosts whether you prefer casting spells or being crafty with traps.  Highly recommended for the casual gamer, it's easy to pick up and go. Maps typically has 15 rounds which take no more than 3-5 minutes each (much faster if you are good)
1055	1	a	A very fun and enjoyable game. Played at friends house and knew it was a must have.
1057	1	a	Simple and fun tower defence game. Solid and stylised graphics with a slick sense of humour. Difficulty curve is a bit all-over-the-place but the gameplay and enjoyment shine through
1059	1	a	Already got it on the Xbox but had to buy it on PC as well. Besides the fact that it's so good I just want to throw money at these guys, I also prefer the prettier graphics on PC :D
1061	1	a	You like orcs? Plenty of them! You hate orcs? What are you waiting for, slaughter them!
1063	1	a	a damn good game that anyone who likes tower defense and/or FPS games should get, definetly in my all time top 10 games absolutly excellent, alot to do and a huge variety of traps and weapons to keep you amused for hours. only shortcoming is its only single players but then theres OMD2 so go get that aswell!!!!!
1065	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played
1067	1	a	Cool Indie game :D 7/10 Stars *******
1069	1	a	A fun, cartoony, tower defense/FPS hybrid game. The controls are fluid and easy to pick up. There's a satisfaction that doesn't come with normal tower defense games where you just sit back and watch. If you liked Sanctum, this is better.
1071	1	a	My god this game is perfect, needs a co-op though, luckilt the second one has it. But holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is the funnest 3 hours ive spent procrastinating an essay in ages   GET IT.
1073	1	a	WAY fun and very addicting!
1075	1	a	Awesome, and addicting, Great DLC, great gameplay, and it's really fun figuring out a good way to lay things out. If you like tower defense games, like DD, then this is the game for you!
1077	1	a	Not only is it one of the best tower defense games ever, but you get to join in the action first-person. And there are so many ways to do it, the maps have a great deal of replay value. I've logged on 100+ hours already, and I'm not done yet.
1079	1	a	great game, a lot of fun
1081	1	a	Great game for the price. I even picked it up on sale. It will give you a lot of game play IF you want to get all five skulls and the achievements. Get ready to be frustratied (unless you play on easy) However, the challenge is part of the game. Remember this is a short game but it's worth the low price.
1083	1	a	Fun game with good strategy components, but with an overall action feel. It allows the player to choose a field control, crowd control or more basic hack and slash approach to the level. Not a lot of replayability, but worth a couple of bucks to play.
1085	1	a	This game has one liners and orcs, I laugh my ♥♥♥ off every level.  Hwever, if you DON'T want a main character that quips every time he puts a trap down (Step right this way, mister orc.) or when you get a kill streak (Awwwwws, look who has no arms...) You'll probably hate it.
1087	1	a	Does a really good job of combining Tower Defense with third person FPS elements. Difficulty curve goes way up halfway through, but it's worth seeing through to the end. Definately recommend for Tower Defense fans.
1089	1	a	Great little game of Tower Defense against countless Orcs where you are right in the action 3d person. Just replace the word Tower with Trap...
1091	1	a	What tower defence looks like in the future, but now...
1093	1	a	This is the perfect game to just start blasting away at every once in a while. Don't expect to get caught up in it for more than a few days, but while you do, it's great. Plain old orc-blasting ogre-hacking fun. Classic hack n' slash that's simply good at what it does.
1095	1	a	Such an amazingly awesome &amp; addictive game, love it!!!
1097	1	a	Awesome...a proper blaster with some turret style tactics and humour thats reminiscent of Evil dead' Ash...recommend it 100%
1099	1	a	Tower defense game for people who hate tower defense games.   I hate tower defense games.
1101	1	a	My favorite tower-defense game as of now. No co op unlike others, but it doesn't spoil the fun.  Approximately 20 levels with 3 different difficulty settings, nice graphics and charme. Wide variety of traps/spells/npcs to help you kill ALL the orcs!
1103	1	a	I used to like orcs...
1105	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an extremely fun Tower Defense game, with a very nice mix of tower (trap) defense and third person action game.  While there are clearly some traps which are much more useful than others and you will tend to gravitate towards them, there is still a large amount to choose from, so you can easily set up some deadly combinations to defeat the invading orcs.  The gameplay is where the game really shines, while the level design is so-so, the sheer amount of variety in the game compensates for that.  The only major fault of the game is that it appears personal abilities are very strong and can overshadow the traps themselves, so if you are strategy minded you might be disappointed since, especially in the early waves, you will have to rely heavily on your character to do most of the work.  Great game let down by balance issues and level design.  8 / 10
1107	1	a	Pure Simple FUN! Can't miss with this one!
1109	1	a	Great tower defense, but it may get repetitive.  Rating: ★★★☆☆ 
1111	1	a	If you like third-person shooters with a mix of tower defense, then 'Orcs Must Die!' is something you'll probably enjoy. Play as the former wizard's apprentice, the War Mage, as you strive to protect magical rifts to the protagonist's homeworld. Those gateways set in various fortresses, you build a variety of traps or even fight head-on with various weapons/abilities to keep hordes of orcs and other monsters from reaching their goal. The game is so fun that will have you hecticly thinking on your virtual feet to plan the many ways to dispatch the onslaught. Replay levels several times after you manage to unlock all the traps, weapons and upgrades to see if you can make it to the top of the leaderboards amongst your friends or the rest of the world. Seriously, you'll have lots of fun.
1113	1	a	Tower defense meets 3rd person shooters. Most excellent, highly recommend it.
1115	1	a	More fun than I bargained for. Worth the purchase 100%!!!!
1117	1	a	Quirky, easy to play, fun for anyone tower defense game. KILL THEM ORCS!
1119	1	a	An excellent game for a reasonnabnle price ! Jump into this action tower defense with loads of fun !
1121	1	a	I bought this game expecting to maybe play it for an hour and move on, but I ended up marathoning it from start to end. The gameplay is fun and innovative (you get a feeling of reward for creating complex traps and you really develop your own playstyle as you go), and the characters (that is, yourself, the mage, the enemy leader and the orcs) are easily likeable. I recommend it to anyone who's ever liked a tower defense game.
1123	1	a	this is worth it. its tower defence but fun like irongrip warlords. unfortunately not multiplay. :_(
1125	1	a	This is an awesome game!!!! MUST HAVE!!! 
1127	1	a	Good for wasting 10 minutes in between doing other stuff.
1129	1	a	The most fun game about genocide ever made.
1131	1	a	Christmas and New Year 2011 was written off because of this game. It was well worth it too!
1133	1	a	This game is HIGHLY addicting. If you're a fan of Tower Defense games then this is for you. You just want to see Orcs getting slaughtered by the thousands!!!
1135	1	a	Now this is a fun game! Combining stragegy and planning with frantic combat and dark humor this is easily one of the indie games I've enjoyed the most over the past few years. I could easily see this doing well on PSN or Xbox Live (if it isn't already).
1137	1	a	Good orginal.. innovative game.. and cheap if on sale.
1139	1	a	Best tower defense game I ever played. Setting traps is fun, especially once you unlock flingers and pushers, and having to mix it up yourself keeps it from getting slow or tedious. Plus if you like peons or Warhammer orcs, you'll love these too.
1141	1	a	This game is simply a must-play for anyone even remotely interested in the tower defense genre. Orcs Must Die blends together strategic trap placement and 3rd person action seamlessly as it delivers a short but sweet experience that you will not soon forget.
1143	1	a	Yes they must.
1145	1	a	The ultimate Tower Defense 3rd person shooter; I would have payed $60 for this game!
1147	1	a	Loads of fun! Not a very long experience, unless you try to perfect every level, but totally worth it!
1149	1	a	What do you need to know that the title doesn't tell you?  This is a great introduction into what is quickly becoming one of my favorite series of games.
1151	1	a	Awesome FPS/TD game. Like Dungeon Defenders, but less monotonous (but also only one-player)
1153	1	a	I get why the Orcs need to die, I really do. But do they HAVE to die? The game never explains why they have to die, or why the wan't to capture the time portal's so badly. Surely their primitive hierarchy of wants and needs can be satisfied with the help of some magic. We don't even know the full story, maybe the portals are Samuri-Jack style way to the past before evil mages took over the orcis agricultural utopia that once existed before hand. We just cant know for certain and for that reason I am a consiencous objector to killing orcs as a TF2 inspired scout-mage until the developers explain why the orcs absolutely 100% MUST die.
1155	1	a	Great game, ♥♥♥♥ you coal and coupons.
1157	1	a	there is only one word to describe this game..... AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
1159	1	a	A fun game of tower defense and FPS
1161	1	a	Great tower defense style shooter.
1163	1	a	Great Game! Fun to play and easy to learn!
1165	1	a	Burst the orcs into pieces! Quite a few weapons and tons of traps promise orc-slashing fun. Nice mechanics, pretty good overview, and a funny background story (which is not all too important, I claim :P ).  All in all a rather nice game to play.
1167	1	a	fun and hard (sometimes) and addicting game, that i can't stop playing. my type of humor too.
1169	1	a	First Person 'Trap' Defense at its finest. Slaying hordes of orcs is so much fun. 8/10
1171	1	a	Honestly one of the best indie game i have had the chance to play, simple premices and tons of fun, the closest thing u'll find to a dungeon keeper, one of the rare games i just play after a bad day :) just makes me laugth and relaxes me, only thing i would say agaisnt it would be it's too bad they didn't addedd a coop mode, many dungeons you play woulda been perfect for a 2 man team, also it's too bad they didn't added a loot system, the game lends itself to collecting loot to upgrade ur war mage but unfortunatly they didn't go for that aspect, oh well can't have everything.
1173	1	a	Surprisingly fun and well put together tower defense game. In a similar fashion to Sanctum, you place traps in the path of your enemies to protect the gate from every wave of increasingly stronger Orcs. You can also use multiple spells and weapons at your disposal to help even the odds. Managed to get 15 hours on my first play through so lots of good gameplay there for the price!  TL;DR: Game is good n' ♥♥♥♥. Go buy it.
1175	1	a	Great mindless fun for the whole family. But really, buy this game!
1177	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive First Player Perspective Tower Defence game. Creative level and trap design lets you experiment with different ways of clearing them. Oh. and once you get weavers you can be a mass-slaughterer of orcs personally. Good times!
1179	1	a	I first tried Orcs Must Die! 2 at RTX and loved it. So I get the first one. Solo is a lot of fun but playing it with a friend is the best way to play this game.
1181	1	a	Amazingly addictive and fun to play.
1183	1	a	Orky Orky times! = Fun times!
1185	1	a	Awesome Trap-Defense / Third Person Shooter. Excellent art, good balance. Lots of gameplay.
1187	1	a	Its not the most 'serious' looking game, and does look rather idiotic, I've enjoyed every second I've put into this game. Its got a great playthrough value, and the replay value is solid as well. If your looking for a fun semi-tower defense game, then this is worth checking out. Its all single player, but check out the second one for co-op!
1189	1	a	what can we say, splendid splendid stuff, great fun that we keep coming back to and it's damned hard at times too!
1191	1	a	A very fun and satisfying tower defense / shooter type game. You have an array of traps and some basic spells to choose from to slice, burn, crush, and explode the Orcs from entering the Rift. Sounds are excellent to make you feel like you are actually doing damage and the visuals aren't the best but still pretty awesome. Tons of voice acting to keep you smiling. There are plenty of Tower Defense / Shooter types out there, but this is the most satisfying one yet.
1193	1	a	Shoot all the orcs!! Set traps for orcs!!! Oooooorcs!
1195	1	a	Tower defense based concept, and great if you're looking for instant action. Choose your character/weapons/traps; kill Orcs and keep them away from the rift!
1197	1	a	A really good, entertaining and challenging game with a lot of replay value that will test your true abilities in the tower defense genre. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand at all and can only be truly mastered by practicing and playing the game through trial and error, how it should be in my opinion. A definite buy for any lover or tower defense games.
1199	1	a	Not bad, about 10 hours of campaign game play in it.
1201	1	a	Funny, hectic, the first time I've seen someone manage to make a first person tower defence game worth playing.
1203	1	a	Nothing beats watching the stupid greenskins fall into your traps of doom.
1205	1	a	It's like tower defense meets action RPG. Orcs Must Die! is quite fun.
1207	1	a	Genuine, 100% organic, sincere, long-forgotten fun with a dash of dark humor. Best buy-2011.
1209	1	a	As I Write This Very Review....And I hear The Gates being seiged by the foul Hourde. I look around at my Current Defences simi confident that they will hold againts the comming storm. Even though I have a storm of emotions rolling inside me I determine one thing............ORS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1211	1	a	♥♥♥♥
1213	1	a	DEff one of the best indie games ive played this year!!!
1215	1	a	'I really like this game'
1217	1	a	There's so many positive things I can say about Orcs Must Die. It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought.  Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps. Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system.  Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay.  Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.
1219	1	a	Think of a tower defence game with a controlable hero. Now replace towers with 100 other cool ways to kill an orc. (like a bladed vacuum that tears fools to shreds) Boom there ya go.  No real story, but that's not really the aim of the game. Just kill ♥♥♥♥.
1221	1	a	fun game...plays smoothly...not overly hard but some maps you do have to plan accordingly or you might let a few get through
1223	1	a	Funny as hell, DLC is a must though, especially when you want to complete the starter levels without any trouble...
1225	1	a	I saw a friend of mine playing a game like this a long time ago on PS1, I never got to try it myself, forgot what it was called, but ever since then Ive been wanting a game where you could spawn all sorts of gorey traps on the walls of a castle and then let the invaders run through them. This game gives me all that, and more, more as in comedy, badassery, archery, when in doubt use fire. This is the first recommendation I've ever done, so I hope that tells you something, it's just a game for pure fun and slaughter of evil orcs.
1227	1	a	Great game for easy fun in first levels, challenging in later ones. Great action-strategy with absurd humor... What more can you ask for?
1229	1	a	Damn, this is some great tower defence meets FPS meets rivers of orc blood.
1231	1	a	10/10 would kill orc again
1233	1	a	cool game, better then i expected, can't remember if i got it for 10$ with the 2 dlc's or what. Game reminds me of torchlight, the colors, architecture &amp; music is ALL very pleasant &amp; i would reccomend this game + dlc for 10$ without much question. I have played it for like 4 hrs so i don't know how much better it will get but i do NOT regret getting it though i never really wanted to begin with. Can't give a out of 10 since i haven't completed at least 50%. Fun game it is.
1235	1	a	It's a good game, but it gets pretty hard towards the end. The sequel is better.
1237	1	a	Awesome tower defense game combined with a third person shooter. Super addicting!
1239	1	a	Just plain simple gory fun
1241	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a great mash up of action and strategy. The game can be played with either an action bent or a more strategic mind. As you unlock more weapons and traps, new strategies will become available making old levels fresh again.
1243	1	a	Wicked fun, and honestly AMAZING value for the money. Even if you don't like tower-defense style games, I would recommend giving this a try!
1245	1	a	Very fun game, give the demo a try!
1247	1	a	pretty good game if you just want to mess around and enjoy funny dialogue. theres worse things you could spend 15 bucks on
1249	1	a	Great and addictive game. Worth to buy it.
1251	1	a	Great blend of FPS and tower defense with fast paced fragging and some good laughs. Two thumbs up!
1253	1	a	A great mix of Tower Defence and Shooter .
1255	1	a	What games used to be. Simple in concept, fun to play and very addictive. The orcs must die!!! Bit of strategy with FPS action a great stress reliever. Don't take it too seriously and you'll love it.   The easy levels are just that easy, the harder ones are much much harder and will make you work for it.   Never knew there were so many way's to kill orcs.
1257	1	a	Ostensibly a Tower Defense game, Orcs Must Die is a downright fantastic take on the genre. With an art style reminiscent of Torchlight and a light-hearted sense of humour revolving around all the myriad ways to kill Orcs, OMD is as fun to watch and listen to as it is to play. The game offers a lot of options, and it does a good job of making them all viable. You can be just as effective using traps to decimate Orcs as you can be wading in with Crossbow and Bladestaff. You can use traps to deal direct damage, or take advantage of physics and fling the Orcs around like ragdolls. You can also opt to be a weapon-wielder, lopping heads and shooting faces, or you can load up with spells and lay all kinds of elemental smackdown. Or any combination of the above.   Orcs Must Die is an aesthetically pleasing game that transcends its origins and does not disappoint in living up to its namesake. This game is excellent.
1259	1	a	At the beginning of each level the characters have some lines. On one of the last levels I was rolling. Just a funny ♥♥♥ line.   Fun game to play.
1261	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very enjoyable mix of the tower defense and third-person shooter genres with plenty of comedy mixed in. The objective of the game is to place traps in order to prevent waves of orcs from making their way through to your world. As you progress, you unlock more traps which you can also upgrade. Furthermore, you can supplement your traps by attacking the orcs directly.  I highly recommend this game. The gameplay and comedy are highly enjoyable. For those looking for a co-op experience, you'll want to check out Orcs Must Die! 2. Which as a bonus includes levels from Orcs Must Die! in addition to it's own, new, levels.
1263	1	a	ONE HELL OF A GAME,  you are missing out if you don’t get this game, with varied levels, weapons/traps and enemies all combined into this small but brilliant game.  it’s a game you can just relax to, set traps and watch your enemies die or get stuck in killing as many Orcs as you can.  Well worth the buy even at full price.
1265	1	a	I took a chance buying this game and i'm glad i did, It's fun and addictive, The beauty of this game is that theres no specific way to set up the traps, Set them up your way, The joy of watching your perfectly arranged traps mowing down hordes of Orcs like a well oiled machine is wonderful to behold, With good graphics, sound and humor, I totally recommend this game, you'll almost feel sorry for the Orcs, Almost.
1267	1	a	Fun game, average graphics; from me 7/10.
1269	1	a	Most of us have a collection of games that we bought for low prices and have never installed. I know I have probably two dozen. This was one of them until today. If it's one of your 'someday' games, change it. Now.
1271	1	a	I picked this game up cheap in a bundle and was very surprised at how very awesome it is. It combines FPS, tower strategy, and humor in delicious proportions. I find it hard to quit. Each level requires its own analysis to determine the best defense, the options are endless, and I don't always get it 'right' and get overwhelmed the first time through. A perfectly played map leads to total personal satisfaction. Orcs Must Die can be played casually in 15 minute bursts, but it is easy to get sucked into multi-hour sessions that leave you tense, sweatry, and carple-tunneled out.
1273	1	a	Tower Defense done right. Well is it really tower defense? It's a yes and no. Towers in this case are traps and you can place them during waves as well if you have money. However you yourself can also defend (much like Sanctum, in fact these two are simliar in more ways then one). Some of the early levels you can beat without usinga single trap but later you'd have a very hard if not impossible time (in my opinion) to beat the levels without using traps. Traps vary from simple floor spikes and wall arrows to flame spitting floor traps and tar pits. It's not your traditional tower defense but it fits enough for me to put it in this genre. Upgrades to the traps comes outside of the levels and are permanent. No need to worry about which one to upgrade, you do it once and it's for good. There are a lot of traps and weapons in this game, a great variety for many different strategys and plenty of replay value.
1275	1	a	This is the greatest orc massive murder of All Time.
1277	1	a	Are you a MASSIVE racist that hates orcs for no rational reason? CONGRATULATIONS! Play this game, and you will have your reason, because they're being bad and invading your rift. You are a loveable idiot (So just like real life), who can dance like nobody's business, and he's humanity's LAST HOPE against the incoming Orc threat. Set traps, headshot orcs, and become the orc-discriminatory hero that the Rift needs.
1279	1	a	When i first played Orcs Must Die i thought what is with all the hype. Recently i've been playing more and more of it, and finally understanding what all the hype is about. Great game for relaxing and just killing things. Turn on some music, and have a great time killing orcs.
1281	1	a	10+ hours.. Awsome TD/HD game.. Lots of jokes.. No multiplayer.. 9 of 10..
1283	1	a	There are a lot of orcs in this game. They all need to die.  The story isn't great but the game itself certainly is. The game is challenging but can also be played in an easier mode if that is more your cuppa tea. For the die-hards, there is also a nightmare mode. Finishing the game for the first time should take a reasonable amount of time (&lt;10h). The replayability is good though, the achievements are fun to try and get, and generally not of the grinding type. Since the way to play a level will completely depend on how you approach it (which traps you use, which weaver, etc) you can do a level multiple types without feeling like it's always the same thing.  It's a lot of fun to find and try out new methods of making Orc-paste (a)
1285	1	a	Great tower defense style of game with a large variety of traps to get you through the levels. Having a third person character to aid your traps adds to the fun.
1287	1	a	I highly reccomend if you're the sort that loves to 'turtle' playing RTS. The entire game is about making crunch points and traps so devious I giggled like a four-year-old mad genius. The dialogue is witty and goofy in a perfectly comic way, and I just love forcing them into narrow pathways and grimacing as bits of Orcs go flying everywhere.
1289	1	a	This game is great. You should play it.
1291	1	a	Best TD game I've ever played.
1293	1	a	I played the crap out of this game on my friends xbox 360 and loved every minute of it.  Pros: Orcs Must Die is just witty, funny, entertaining, strategy driven tower defense with a 3rd person shooter slapped on top of it, utilitizing traps to push back hordes of orcs and other monsters . This game is just great 100%.  Cons: Honestly there is no cons to this game that I find worth mentioning.  Overall: 9.9/10 because on warmaster this game is intense.
1295	1	a	LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN... always love td games, this is a great lighthearted one with lots of very funny one liners like.. well wait and see and you will be 'Winning!'  Seriously worth a tenner considering that would last u 20 mins in a pub. Had over 20 hrs play time on it and not nrly finished everything yet.. then i suck anyway lol!
1297	1	a	Similar to Sanctum, but more addictive with better presentation but no multiplayer. A bargain at any price under $15
1299	1	a	Fantastic game for playing solo, if you want co op then go for the Orcs must die 2
1301	1	a	This game is incredibley fun if you love seting up your on personal sen's funhouse and killing orcs like its an average day at the office. So have fun commiting genicide.
1303	1	a	Great tower defense game. If you haven't played this, you're an asshat.
1305	1	a	Simple and addictive, set traps and shoot big green bad guys. Brilliant.
1307	1	a	Another great spin on tower defense. You can create elaborate traps - lots of very fun trap types that work well together, each one upgradeable for a small meta game (each trap type can be upgraded once). You can also take on orcs by making yourself more powerful (upgrading spells, damage, etc). And of course, you can do both. The main campaign has 24 levels, which take anywhere from 5-15 minutes each. Took me about 8-10 hrs to complete the campaign. Then if you enjoyed it, there's leaderboards and some DLC that give you reasons to play more.
1309	1	a	I did not expect this to be anywhere near as stupidly fun as it is!
1311	1	a	A solid orc-killing tower-defending good time. Funny, sharp, and fun. Not really too long though. 4/5
1313	1	a	MORE SPIKE TRAPS!
1315	1	a	Loads of Orcs, Traps, and Maps make for a great 'Tower Defense' style game. The game doesn't take itself seriously at all which makes it even more fun &amp; the cartoon-ish Art Style gives the added benefit of some pretty awsome Death Faces on the Orcs! Go for it, especially on Sale!
1317	1	a	If you have played Dungeon Defenders, this feels just like it expect it's single player. It is a great game, all the traps and weapons feel really nice and the game will always give you a challenge.
1319	1	a	This is a fun two player experience and is rather unique in its approach. I'd call this a good game if you are not expecting more than it has to offer. It is good at what it does offer.
1321	1	a	This game is, simply put, fantastic. It is basically a Third Person Action/Tower Defense game hybrid. I loved it. It is very humorous, but the story is not where it shines. In fact, the story is somewhat forgettable. The gameplay is what makes this game so great. It is challenging, unique, and most importantly, VERY fun. It also has a pretty decent replay value. However, I would recommend just getting Orcs Must Die! 2 instead, since it has moar weapons, traps, maps. OMD2 also has co-op which is great.. But if you want the classic maps from this game to play in Co-Op in OMD2, then you want to buy this one too. Treat it like a DLC to OMD2 that adds 10 maps.   9/10 (Buy OMD2 instead, or buy it on sale)
1323	1	a	This game has soul. A 3rd person shooter/tower defense mix, the traps are neat, the levels are fun, and the dialogue is frikkin hilarious. It has a moderate learning curve, so dont expect to get perfect scores on your first play through, but it grows on you. A high level of polish, great sounds, animations, and design make this a great game worth the price. 9/10
1325	1	a	An action oriented tower defence game, where you are right in the midst of the battle, tossing down traps, casting fireballs and building crazy trap combos. Good mechanics, cheerful aesthetics, funny lines... The comboing mechanic is cool, but a bit under used. Especially if you don't care about getting the high score and would rather concentrate on getting a perfect run.
1327	1	a	buy game very good plz
1329	1	a	Similar to Dungeon Defenders but not a grindfest, no item drops or multiplayer either, but the gameplay itself is much more fun, interesting, and challenging in the right ways. The traps/upgrades are creative and diverse enough to allow for tons of different ways to conquer each level. The sequel is gonna have co-op.
1331	1	a	Game of the Year! ;) (Y)
1333	1	a	Not quite tower defense, not quite action game, but it is definitely awesome. It's fast-paced, quite replayable, very humorous, pretty challenging. Music's pretty cool as well. I love this game to pieces... with traps.
1335	1	a	Fun and hilarious!! Worth every penny.
1337	1	a	Stupid fun, but it gets really hard down the road. Army of Darkness feeling, and full of cheesy lines.
1339	1	a	This is a pretty awesome game, don't let the Orcs invade your Castle
1341	1	a	Lots of traps, even more orcs, rifts, egocentric and big-headed apprentice. Funny taunts and dialogues in the midst of flying spare body orc parts everywhere. Yes, that's this game. Silly thing it is =]
1343	1	a	Very cool little indie gem right here! :) Got awesome graphics and it's pretty chalenging!! 8/10 for me ;) I definatelly recomend it
1345	1	a	This game is a great tower defence game, really cool design and nice graphics... absolute steal on the humble bundle I got it from.
1347	1	a	This game is really fresh and original. Everything about it is great. Highly recommend it!
1349	1	a	A fun and awesome Tower Defense game, has plenty of strategic oppertunities and is really fun 10/10
1351	1	a	A very good game,nice visuals,great soundtrack!
1353	1	a	A tower defense game mixed with RPG elements and a 3rd person perspective on your hero. A really enjoyable game where you are a young wizard defending the onslaught of orcs. You set up each mission by placing your 'towers' (in this games case, traps) to slow the orcs down. This is only your first line of defense as you control the young wizard once the round starts. Cast magic, go melee, fix traps, and much more.  I would recommend getting this game before purchasing the sequel. Sure the second one has two player co-op, but this will be cheaper and allow you to get a feel for the game. If you really enjoy the game and, like myself, find yourself wanting co-op play to add new deminsions and strategy, grab the second one. If you are quick, grab both games from Humble Bundle (as of this posting 12/10/13) and get both games, all DLC, for $4.25.  I highly recommend giving it a try. Watch the video/trailer to see if the playing style is what you are wanting too. If not, then don't waste your time because you will not be satisfied. If you are intrigued or thinking, 'yeah I will give it a try. looks fun!' then you should buy this right away.
1355	1	a	9 out of 10. It took me about 12 hours to get through the 18 map campaign, and I've spent at least another 12 going back and replaying the levels to try to get more achievements and better level scores. Each map probalby takes 10 minutes to play. You run around setting up traps (kind of tower defense-like) to kill the orcs, kobolds and ogres as they try to make their way through the map from the gate to your rift. You have weapons as spells for direct combat. It's fun to see if you can build the best configuration of traps to stop all the monsters. Single player only. Very stable, I only noticed one very minor bug with a monster getting stuck in lava and not dieing, but I was able to work around it. The character you play is very humorous in the things he says and does, as are the orcs.
1357	1	a	A rather fun and whacky game where you defend and let no orc pass thru.. Use a dozen of different traps, weapons to slay and mutilate orcs hahah... Fun and very challenging! :D
1359	1	a	Really enjoying this game, Great amount of traps to play with and great selection of weapons. If you enjoy tower defence games but wanna also play a character on them this is for you.
1361	1	a	Overall I did enjoy Orcs during the short time I spent with it, and it is a great game. However, it generally didn't stand out of the pack for me, and came at the end of a long winded era of tower defense games.
1363	1	a	Didn't play much of it but was fun while I did.
1365	1	a	Best orc-slaying experience you´ll get, besides the second part of course. Building traps and getting the best rating on the highest difficulty in every level got me quite some time but damn, worth it, so much fun!
1367	1	a	A fantastic frantically paced tower defense/action hybrid done right. Good for hours upon hours of simple orc and ogre slaying delight.
1369	1	a	This game is pure fun. It strikes a tough balance between having traps that are underpowered making the player do all the work, and the traps being overpowered leaving the player with nothing to do but sit back and dodge the bloodsplats. It's always a frantic rush around the level picking off the few stragglers and strategically thinning the ranks with a crossbow or magic spell.
1371	1	a	I was genuinely surprised by this game. I like killing Orcs, (thank you Warhammer: Space Marine) so I decided to pick this up. It is simply a great game. The dialogue knows its place, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely solid. A great balance between combat and defensive strategy. The maps ramp in difficulty quite nicely, and the creators were smart to add enemies that will mess with tactics that worked a few maps ago. Forcing the player to really think about each map is something that shows good game design and I really admire it. If you like tower defense games and are looking for something a bit different, definitely check this out.
1373	1	a	What do you get when you combine tower defense and action? Here it is - Orcs Must Die! An innovative twist to tower denfence genre is what you can look forward here. The use of a variety of traps and your action skills are a must to survive each wave of orcs. It's comical to watch how the orcs suffer from your well placed traps, flying through the air and meeting to their ultimate end with a lovely Ode to Joy BGM as the icing (BGM imagined in your head). And you can unlock gifts in Orcs Must Die 2 if you have Orcs Must Die. Surely a must have for those who love tower defence with a sadistic sense of humor. =)
1375	1	a	great single player game
1377	1	a	Who could find the killing of orcs en masse dissatisfying!? Not me, that’s for sure. That’s why I liked this game very much. You will like it very much too.
1379	1	a	Orcs, Orcs, Orcs and did I mention there are orcs ? This game is all about orcs! You are the last defender of the magic in your world, but you are kinda stupid and not very good at your job! So jump right into the action and kill orcs, orcs and orcs (sometimes a few oger)
1381	1	a	Insanely fun game to play! All I can really say is that ORCS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1383	1	a	More awesome than you could possibly imagine.  
1385	1	a	Loved it!
1387	1	a	Very Fun 3rd Person Tower Defense!  Tony Seal of Approval
1389	1	a	This game is amazingly addicting. Fast paced castle defense and shooter mix-up kind of thing. It's a unique blend of awesome.
1391	1	a	Surprisingly fun and captivating, this game will surely keep you entertained for a few hours
1393	1	a	its the best game on earth
1395	1	a	Interesting game~
1397	1	a	I...I think I just realized I don't like tower defense games after all the ones I've tried. I can recognize this as being a well made hybrid of that and a third-person shooter, and there are definitely things about it I can appreciate, but even after trying it twice a couple years apart, I've bounced off it both times. Thanks, Orcs Must Die. You seem like a good game...for someone else.
1399	1	a	Fun and simple, with lots of jokes, this game is a MUST buy, this and the sequel!
1401	1	a	Awesome Defense - type game. It has lots of replayality.
1403	1	a	Awsm Game!
1405	1	a	They must all die.
1407	1	a	Cool because its a First person tower defense
1409	1	a	Best story ever. Needs movie adaptation. 12/10 Would bang again.
1411	1	a	A nice little break from Skyrim
1413	1	a	The best rgp 3ird person Tower defance I hav eevery played well the only one I have played but still worth it the sequal is comming out soon also worth it the only bad thing is you will get tired half why through need commitment
1415	1	a	Wicked fun, Time waster Helps relieve the stress of TMH!!!
1417	1	a	Alright, I gotta admit, there's a perverse sort of classic Tom &amp; Jerry fun to be had with this game and I have had quite a bit of that fun with this game. Not the best 'action tower defense' game mind (it's dying for a co-op mode), but it's twists in the formula are lotsa fun.
1419	1	a	Army of Darkness meets Plants vs. Zombies. Auf Englisch extrem gut!
1421	1	a	This game is a blast, fun form the get go.. and it only gets better. Its tower deffence on setroids. Bored with those 2D tower deffence games, then give this a try..
1423	1	a	I felt like dungeon defenders was a cooler version of this game, orcs were kinda lifeless and the traps and weapons didn't offer much satisfaction when slaughtering the enemy.. for me a game needs solid foundation and this one didn't hold any emotional connection to the mindless action.. but theres more action goin on in yer parents bedroom. I'd have to say this crap is wack, and the second game might have improved to a better standard. the intro video got one good laugh and that I will never forget, but I have moved on from this heaping pile of dog fecal.. to better things. 1/10
1425	1	a	Very addicting and fun.
1427	1	a	This game runs face-first into the same problem that Sanctum did - that success relies on one correct strategy from the beginning. Not only that, but you get to upgrade your traps, and if you mess that up by putting them in the wrong areas, there's no refunds - you actually have to start a new profile.  The graphics, music, sound and concept all receive an A, but the number of flawed tower defense games on this planet are as innumerable as the stars.
1429	1	a	funny story lines and hillraious character.
1431	1	a	It's Lord of the Rings meets Sanctum in this brilliant action/tower defense game. From the moment you lay your first trap you will be drawn in by the distinctive characters. As the title implies there is only one objective, you must kill every last orc that charges into your keep. The myriad of traps at your disposal, as well as your keen sword and spells, get this task done with prejudice. It's wickedly entertaing and slightly demented watching the orcs hurl themselves into spinning blades and explosive barrels, all the while taunting you and laughing about their impending victory. I had childish glee when the hero started trash talking back. For a game with only one hero and a handful of enemy types it is dripping with charm and style. However it is not without minor issues. The animations could use a little more work and the single minded gameplay won't last forever, but these are barely worth mentioning. The dark sense of humor and the variety of death mark this as a must play8/10
1433	1	a	Stop hesitating and start building .
1435	1	a	  Strategy with action!
1437	1	a	Good game, but short.
1439	1	a	Amusing, mindless fun. Slaughtering orcs makes for good gameplay and a great way to unwind after work. The third-person perspective offers a different approach to tower defense games.
1441	1	a	Entertainingly Epic
1443	1	a	Traps, weapons, minions, towers, and (of course) orcs abound in this third-person tower defence game. The dialogue is surprisingly funny and adds a bit of zest to the already-fun task of creating the world's least orc-friendly castle hallways.  Tip: Use a row of wall blades and tar pits (with some barricades, if necessary) to create a single-file orc slaugherhouse. It's as much fun to build as it is to watch in action.
1445	1	a	Orcs Must Die. Just Orcs Must Die. This game got me hooked since the moment I put a feet on the world of rifts, as the successor of the 'Old Man'. The different waves of orcs and different abilities you get after each level encourages playing, the graphics are amazing, the music is epic and I think I found one of my favorite all-time games. Can't wait to play the sequel. 9.5/10
1447	1	a	If you hate orcs, this is the game for you
1449	1	a	Incredibly fun, witty, and challenging. Not your typical tower defense game; with gorgeous graphics, fun dialogue, and a soundtrack that sounds like Mastadon did a Gregorian Chant album. Addictive gameplay that is absolutely worth the price!
1451	1	a	i killed a lot of orcs. it was pretty fun. definitely worth a few dollars. give green to kill green. orc are scum kill all orc.
1453	1	a	Tower defense with strategy. Rather, it's strategy using tower defense. The 'towers' aren't so much towers as they are traps. Oil traps, impaling traps, arrow traps, launcher traps, and so on. Set them up at the right spots, and watch the orcs go flying back the way they came, or dying on the spot.  Oh, and don't forget to listen to what they say while you're killing them, or what your character says while he's killing them. That's always amusing.
1455	1	a	Really great Game! Its ratehr addicting and loads of fun. Sadly this one is only single player but OMD2 is multiplayer so i would suggest getting that 1 to play with friends, but this is still an awesome game totally worth 10$. You'll get your moneys worth if you like Tower Defense games with a 3rd person shooter/melee/magic twist.
1457	1	a	This is a SUPER fun game to play!
1459	1	a	Ever played a tower defense game and thought to yourself; if only I could go and intervene when ♥♥♥♥ happens. Well if so then this is the game for you. Funny and chaotic. Its addictive as ♥♥♥♥, much like most tower defense games. I had tons of fun with it.
1461	1	a	One of my favourites in 2011
1463	1	a	This is by far one of the most entertaining mindless games I've played for a very long time. I feel like a warning to new players is in order, your fingers will hurt if you mash the attack button to much. Once you got a general feel for the game and only aimed at their heads the game was much more bareable.  Mainly comedy and random orc genocide all in one game.
1465	1	a	excellent tower defence game.
1467	1	a	Ridiculously fun game. Easy to lose track of time and actually quite challenging!
1469	1	a	This is a game that I consistently come back to.  Orcs Must Die is a 3rd person action tower defense game. You are given a countdown timer to run and place your objects, road blocks, and towers before the doors break down and a horde of Orcs, Goblins, Kobalds, Ogres and more come storming through. It's up to you a battlemage to use your spells and wepaons to stop them from running into a portal that takes them into your kingdom.   After a certain level, you unlock Weavers which give your character special bonuses and skill trees. To an extent it's a level-by-level RPG as well. You choose from a backpack of skills and utilities that you have hot keyed to your 1-9 keys.   I got this game for $3.74 during a special, but I'd recommend it at full price no matter what. It's really worth it.  This game has no multi-player, however Orcs Must Die 2 is multi-player.
1471	1	a	There are these orcs. They must die. ALL OF THEM.  This game owns. (also I wrote this recommendation so I'd get a steam gift thingie achievement)
1473	1	a	This game is ridiculous.
1475	1	a	This is an awesome game. And this is coming from someone who despises tower defense games.
1477	1	a	An instant classic. Shame it's only single player - we hope that OMD 2 will have a coop feature.
1479	1	a	Orcs, Must, DIE! that is a fact of life, challenging game, tower defense style that can frustrate you for hours.
1481	1	a	This game is a super fun hack-and-slash and easily runs! There's not even a storyline to get in the way.
1483	1	a	Remember, you are the hero, but they see you as the final boss of a dungeon crawl. Its you, and your traps. Against hundreds or orcs. Now, if it was thousands, Then maybe, just maybe, it would be a fair fight.
1485	1	a	Decent Game. The second one is better in my opinion.
1487	1	a	A cool tower defense with a twist, namely first person shooter. this makes placing traps and countering waves from different points tougher, but it also lets you counter the ones that slip through. Relatively cool graphics with lots of blood and ork bodyparts doesnt hurt either.
1489	1	a	Fun! Fast paced Mayhem! With a great sense of humor!
1491	1	a	I thought this was just a silly little same but for as simple as the idea is i find it really enjoyable.
1493	1	a	This game is incredible!! Tower defense + realtime action + comedic humor = HOURS of great mindless entertainment. Highly recommend this to anyone!!
1495	1	a	Very Fun mix of a Castle Defense and 3rd person Action game.Can play a round in 20 minutes or less or play for hours. Lots of replay-ability and fun combos with the traps.
1497	1	a	I'm hooked on this game. It has the right blend of puzzle solving and shooter gameplay to keep me coming back for more. There are variable solutions (aka trap combinations) to deal with the endless orcs, gnolls, kobolds and hellbats which keeps me coming back trying to get that last elusive skull. The main character apprentice war-mage is great; it's like Charlie Sheen playing Harry Potter (he even says 'Winning' in the game). The difficulty curve does get steep about 3/4 of the way through the game, where it starts to feel impossible to get perfection on a level. Would be cool if there was some form of co-op multiplayer on this, but I'm hopeful that this game will have DLCs in the future to include new traps, levels, player-characters.
1499	1	a	This game is cute. Good personality, good graphics, satisfying traps. challenging to build an optimal route. Only a few kinds of enemies, the 'gotta shoot them in the head' thing gets annoying after a while.
1501	1	a	Killing Orcs in a FPS/Stragedy world.. How does it get any better.
1503	1	a	This is a great tower defense style game with 3rd person shooter elements. Its pitfall is that it has no multiplayer support, but this is an issue solved in the sequel. You can upgrade your traps or your character's weapons, depending on your play style. Each map is unique and interesting, sometimes with the inclusion of environmental hazards.
1505	1	a	Know about tower defense games? Know about fantasy creatures? Know about humour? Know about shooters? You'll see all of them combined in this amazing action-strategy game by Robot Entertainment.  The main objective is that all orcs must die. But in order to complete that objective, you'll need to place traps and learn spells and forge weapons and train an army and... use your head. And your muscles. Because there are many ways to finish a level. If an orc or one of their allies (kobolds, ogres, goblins) lives long enough to reach the rift you're bound to protect, then it's over. Remeber: you're a War Mage, and War Mages need to protect the rifts at all cost.  You can use the environment, hire troops, place traps, engage them with your weapons, do as you please, as long as you get to carry your objective.  Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die!  
1507	1	a	great game, just smash zombies in many ways, 10 out of 10 :)
1509	1	a	A fun game with orcs that must die
1511	1	a	Have you noticed how Tower Defense has become like FPS used to be? A new one launches every week. This game sets itself out from the pack by having you play over the shoulder or first person. Good amount of comedy. Nice graphics. You get to kill, maime, and roast Orcs. What isn't there to like?
1513	1	a	Best fun you can have killing Orcs...EVER!  If you don't download the demo and stop reading this...I'll send an orc army to make you!!!  Great title, excellent graphics, very polished. Runs well on even low end hardware/laptops.
1515	1	a	A very fun game that has the best sense of humor since Portal! I first thought OMD! was a low-quality indie game, but it is actually a fantastically made, very well-presented title! The graphics and art style are gorgeous, the animations are flowing, the controls are super smooth, and the traps and sound effects are very impactful (pun intended). Basically, the art, sound, and controls outdo many AAA titles! Plus the humor, wow, this game is truly hilarious. I laughed so many times at the quirky humor. Although the defense aspect isn't super strategic and does rely on trial and error, it is very fun nevertheless. Plus, I love that I can employ my quick reflexes and twitch gaming skills to headshot Orcs left and right. Unlike other defense games where you often indirectly fight, there's always something to set up, shoot, or blow up. Overall, OMD! is nonstop carnage, mayhem, and hilarity! A true gem for fans of defense games, third-person action, and quality humor!
1517	1	a	While writing this review, I have not yet beaten this game. In fact, I'm pretty sure I still have ways to go. However, after quite a bit of anticipation, I'm glad to say that this game is worth its weight. Its a unique spin to a genre that is getting more popular and offers a ton of variety. Without having to due any calculation whatsoever in terms of placing down this or that, I simply go with what I prefer. There is plenty of choice and strategy.    The flow of the game goes quite well with its style of humor and aesthetics. It reminds me a bit of Heretic/Hexen in terms of weaponry/magic and the music strikes a resembling similarity to Warcraft 2.   My only complaint is the lack of multiplayer. While a great game on its own, having the ability to play with someone else would make it much much more entertaining. However, one can only hope that it will be future content... otherwise I'll just get Dungeon Defenders when it is released.  5/5 Rating
1519	1	a	It's tower defense, but without all the boring.
1521	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a beautiful game. That's not just the graphics, though the art is highly stylized and very fitting of the game's comical atmosphere. OMD takes the addictive mechanics of the tower defense genre and the fast-paced gameplay of an action RPG and creates a hybrid that works far better then would be expected. At first it just gives you a new tower every level, but then you get magic gauntlets and paladins and skill tree and meta-upgrades; there's a tremendous amount of content in OMD, and a tremendous number of orcs waiting to break through your defenses and charge your portals. If only you had aimed that fireball a little more accurately or placed those tar traps a bit further apart...  Oh well, 'Retry Level.'
1523	1	a	This is the only tower defense game other than Revenge of the Titans that has held my interest for more than a few minutes. You'd think I'd like Sanctum better due to my preference for sci-fi over fantasy settings, but I couldn't get into Sanctum at all.
1525	1	a	It might be singleplayer only, but I haven't had this much fun with a game since I first played Team Fortress.
1527	1	a	Orcs MUST die! Just as the title states! 5/10
1529	1	a	Great hero TD
1531	1	a	It's the kind of power fantasy your insecure ♥♥♥ could really use to help you get through the day! Buy it and feel like a man, manly woman, more manly mandroid, or other-gendered being with a sudden infusion of manity.
1533	1	a	All the same things from Orcs Must Die 2 apply to Orcs Must Die. If you own both games, the levels from the first can be played from within the second game. I'd recommend playing it from the second game as all the new customisation features will apply to first game's levels, and you'll be able to play as the sorceress.  If playing this from the first game there are a couple of things to note:  * Its customisation system is not nearly as good as the second game. * There isn't as much variety as there is in the second game. Applies to weapons, characters, traps and monsters. 
1535	1	a	This or Dungeon Defenders or Monday Night Combat or... well, approach the notion with this question: do I have ANY friends at all? If the echoing response happens to be a sheepish '...no...' then call Orcs Must Die your newest and only bud.  Orcs Must Die shares more in common with the likes of Lock's Quest than any of the previously mentioned seige-style titles. You, as the Apprentice, are the sole line of defense for a series of interdimensional whatsits. Good, hands-on slaughter earns bonuses; creative execution of traps earn you multipliers. This set up should dispell for you where the focus of Orcs Must Die sits: action first, clever second.
1537	1	a	This game is quite unique perhaps on the PC because whilst it is a tower defence game, this is a tower defence game built on pure action. It is a fast, fluid third person game with a high frame rate and a frenetic pace that never lets up. The controls are responsive and easy to get used to, and the gameplay is as tactically deep as it is fast and furious. Add to that just a lot of great humour that is expressed in the hero's opening lines to each level and this is definitely one of the best indie action games of recent years.
1539	1	a	Just another tower defense? Think again. This game is great, spamable crossbow, hack-and-slash, quick magic spells, orcs torn to pieces, sliced orcs, impailed orcs, burnt orcs, electrocuted orcs, orcs swimming in acid and lava pits, flying orcs, orcs flying into one another because of your catapults. This game is awesome and you can be too if you buy it. The only downside: it's with orcs.
1541	1	a	Excelent game, highly recommended, try the demo.
1543	1	a	An execellent tower defense/strategy game with a little humor. Great graphics, lots of things to built, lots of magic to cast; and lots of maps to test your skills on. Most importantly, it's good fun.
1545	1	a	it's ok  buy the second 1.  (&gt; -.- )&gt; / 5
1547	1	a	Fun game. I guess I'd describe it as defense with traps instead of towers. Very similar to Dungeon Defenders, but where DD succeeded in its multiplayer, this game succeeds in its silly nature and delicious traps of death.
1549	1	a	A great combination of strategy and real time FPS. Your maze making, and trap combinations will either save your bacon, or doom you to difficult last second battles against hoards of Orcs and other nasties. The balance is great, the visuals fresh and smooth, and there’s more of a story than it first seems, (Cocky apprentice takes over for crotchety old wizard. How many times have we seen that right?) with actual character development. This is 'must buy' in my opinion.
1551	1	a	This game is worth all the money you'll ever put into hospital and electiricy bills.
1553	1	a	This is a really clever and fun TPS tower defense strategy game. The dungeon atmosphere really makes it stand out from the growing crowd. Lots of weapon and trap unlocks give the right incentive to want to push further in the campaign missions. It does get quite difficult as a single player game because the monsters often attack from opposite sides of the map and it's hard to be fighting two places at once--they do provide portals to shorten the journey but they always seem to be poorly positioned (would have been nicer if you got to place the portals yourself). There is also a high dependence on your shooter skills because the trap reload times take forever in the heat of battle, although it is possible I haven't figured out the right mix. So far, I've only seen upgrades for traps, not weapons which is a bummer.    No coop is the game's major weakness, but it is enjoyable despite.
1555	1	a	Quite fun game of a first person shooter/tower defense hybrid, and lots of possible combinations for causing mayhem!
1557	1	a	Play Orcs Must Die! It's a good game.
1559	1	a	It's strangely addicting to set up diabolical traps for hundreds of orcs to meet their collective doom.
1561	1	a	Tower defense is really growing on me lately and this is essential massacre fun. The traps require lots of strategy and many games will leave you on edge taking out the few who make it through everything. Later on you focus on traps on increasing your own power to deal with the invasions yourself! Nice variety of orcs too.
1563	1	a	Mindless fun. Buy it on sale.
1565	1	a	It's a great, fast-paced point(s) defense game with oodles of ways to dispatch your enemies! So spice!
1567	1	a	Highly addicting game that feels part RPG, part tower defense. Fully recommended!
1569	1	a	Very entertaining game with lots of traps/weapons strategies and abilities to kill poor innocent orcs. Also I like game style and humour. Additional weapons in DLC may help too. Try it!
1571	1	a	Until LvL 18 this game is quite ok. Then the difficulty level starts to rise without any sign or reason. A level that you cannot beat without looking into a guide on youtube or s.th. like that. Bad gameplay-design sucks. Game deinstalled. Not to recommend!
1573	1	a	this feels like a Disney cartoon gone horribly wrong. which is a good thing. probably the most fun I had with an action game all year.
1575	1	a	A combination of tower defense and 3rd person action/shooting. This light hearted title asks you to not only strategize your defensive layouts but to also throw yourself into the thick of the combat in order to kill thousands upon thousands of bloodthirsty Orcs.
1577	1	a	This game is awesome - I haven't had this much fun since my wife got her hair caught in the tumble dryer.
1579	1	a	The game can easily be summed up by its title. Orcs Must Die is about making a large amount of orcs into a large amount of dead orcs (and orc pieces). Of course, there's more to it than simply 'Use crossbow on orc' as there are a number of fiendish traps, magic, and AI guardians that you can employ, making it something akin to a tower-defence game. There's more focus on action, though, as you're encouraged to jump in and do your part in causing a bit of death and dismemberment of your own. On top of it all is a somewhat basic story, though there is so much character and humor packed in that it still seems fresh and entertaining. To call the game 'mindless fun' would be a little misleading as there is some strategy involved in trap placement and personal upgrades, but the real fun lies in watching a group of clueless orcs wandering towards a corridor full of all manner of blades and spikes and being reduced to 'orc salsa' while you giggle softly to yourself.
1581	1	a	Hell O' Game!! Definate replay value here. Reminds me of what Plants Vs Zombies would look like in 3D.
1583	1	a	Great game, fun, entertaining. What could be better than roll over some overgrown orcs!
1585	1	a	Awesome game! - Many fun hours spent =)
1587	1	a	Loved. Every. Moment.
1589	1	a	If you are a fan of tower defense, third person shooting, headshots, and Orcs then this is a must buy. Also look into the sequel.
1591	1	a	A tower defence game that's all kinds of entertaining, engaging, and challenging. And while it has all of the usual trappings of a tower defence game, it also functions as a third-person shoter, allowing you to get in on the carnage. Use your traps and spells/weapons to liquify, crush, scorch, grind, and perforate thousands of orcs as they try vainly to infiltrate your castle. If watching orcs be electrocuted and set on fire while being sucked into a meat grinder is your thing, then this might just be the game for you!
1593	1	a	Even if you don't reach for scoring, it's a very nice game to play. I'm not in tower-defence but this TPS-ish version of it is much fun.
1595	1	a	Excellent tower defense game, I recommend!
1597	1	a	The launch trailer was made to 'The Hall of the Mountain King', performed by Apocalyptica. If you need any other incentive, you are a strange man indeed!
1599	1	a	Tremendous fun and way way better than most of the offerings of the oversaturated hero/tower defense genre. Lovely physics gimmicks.
1601	1	a	And oh how they must die. And by so many methods! A great game that tests the ingenuity of your trap placement to maximize the rate of destructive carnage against many enemy types. It's also very accessible for those with limited time, as levels usually lasts less than 15 minutes.
1603	1	a	Never thought that this was just a indie game. Add some tower defence with some Shooter elements and you get Orcs must die. Simple and fascinating. Sometimes it was hard but never unfair. But if you upgrades the units/traps, you will probably stick to the same strategy. So even when I finished the game, I didnt try out every trap.
1605	1	a	Quite nice TPP tower defense game. A bit like Dungeon Defenders but less spammy, and no local multi.
1607	1	a	Orcs Must Die is pure fun. I've sunk over 40 hrs into this game and loved every minute of it. I really hope they make a sequel.
1609	1	a	This game can puzzle you since there are so many ways you can finish each level, but a good game nonetheless, I guess you can really test your creativity here. You better have a fast clicking ffinger because you're going to left click a lot lol.
1611	1	a	Fun as hell and addictive. The voiceovers are great too with the right amount of humor.
1613	1	a	Dead Orc = Good Orc
1615	1	a	Starts out slow - boring, even. But the more new abilities, traps, enemies and levels you unlock, the more addictive it gets!
1617	1	a	Two words best describe this game: fun and addictive. Few things are quite as satisfying as defeating wave after wave of orcs with all sorts of traps and spells.
1619	1	a	It's very well-made, and fun to play. The traps are pretty interesting and varied, although some are kinda useless.
1621	1	a	very short, but sweet none the less  good balanced gameplay, strategy is used, but it could be expanded a lot
1623	1	a	Crazy fun action, with fun weapons, and a nice strategy element from the trap placement aspect. Also, a decent story that mostly takes a backseat to the action, but is enough to be interesting.
1625	1	a	'WINNING' man this games so much fun it's a mix of pre strag and real time it's has some funny one linners.
1627	1	a	This game is incredibly satisfying. The character is hilarious and the traps are really fun to watch as they slaughter millions of orcs. Some later maps get very hard and there is no endless mode.
1629	1	a	Verry nice, and fun game, the best game to come down if you are mad :D
1631	1	a	Damn, this game is fun. I'd play a lot more Tower Defense if there were more like this— just the right balance of strategy and fast-paced action, especially on Nightmare difficulty; also, the dumb humor hits just the right note.
1633	1	a	The combination of tower defense action and kickass music is what makes this game awesome!
1635	1	a	Great game. Makes a whole new meaning to tower defense.
1637	1	a	You get a nice amount of choice of style in this Defense game, balancing between the amount of damage you do yourself and the amount of damage your traps do. And it's nice to see orcs explode in tiny bits or run screaming while they are on fire.  I would like it if there were more different lines of combad shouting. Perhaps in a DLC?
1639	1	a	Hate Orcs? and want to kill them with traps and spells...then this game is for you!
1641	1	a	For me, more outright fun than Sanctum or Dungeon Defenders. Dungeon Defenders suffers from a Sisyphean feeling of level and item grinding common to MMO's, and Sanctum feels too prescriptive in what approach you need to take to win like more traditional tower defense games. Orcs Must Die avoids this rewarding you with a new toy on each level, and only requiring grinding to beat highscores. Gaining access to new combinations, and highscore tracking, keeps replaying earlier levels interesting.
1643	1	a	It is like dungeon defenders if you played it, but yuo are alone, there is more fun and there isn't the multiplayer.  7/10
1645	1	a	Awesome game! One of the best in Hero Tower Defense genre.
1647	1	a	It is rare that a game remembers what games are all about and remembers it the entire way through the game. Orcs Must Die! keeps its eye on the prize: fun. Every aspect of the game is designed around fun. Orcs exploding: fun. Death traps: fun. The player figuring their own ways through levels, not being restricted to a certain type of approach: fun. There's little in the way of plot, but just enough to keep it...fun. Until this game, I never felt the need to get every achievement just to eek out more playtime, but this game was good enough that I did so. It can be quite frustrating, but that mostly happens through challenges you make yourself - you don't have to 5 star every level, you don't have to play through nightmare mode, but you'll want to. It's a fantastic game that is just long enough, with just enough plot, to make every single section fun.
1649	1	a	Highly responsive (UI, sound, controls) FPS tower defense game with a great art style and direction. Leaderboards incite long-term commitment and replay of already consumed content, and the death animations are hilariously fun. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an easy to pick up and fun short game session.
1651	1	a	More then only funny game... This game is awesome, you can't stop play... :)
1653	1	a	Get this game. It's got a great art style, cartoony - but not excessively so, bloody - but not excessively so, and fun - excessively so (sic).   The DLC is worth every cent as well, the few new traps and spells are great fun, and the new missions are challenging as heck. Turn it up to Nightmare for additional fun and frustration.   This game makes me feel like the defense of Helms Deep, every single mission. It's you against hundreds, thousands of orcs. Cannot recommend this game enough.
1655	1	a	OMD plays a little like Sanctum, but with a greater focus on personal power and less on mazing. The engine also has several physics based traps enabling you to reposition the creeps, enabling fun things like flinging orcs back to the beginning of your kill corridor or tossing them up to the top of a wall covered in instruments death to tumble back down it in bloody chunks. The only bad thing I can really say about this game is that there's no co-op.  Highly reccommended if you even have only a passing interest in TD games.
1657	1	a	There are Tower Defence games, and then there are games like Ork's Must Die. I very action packed game with a major focus on letting the player getting some insane kill counts and the like along with some brutal animations to follow. It ramps up the challanges as you progress, and offers allot of tools for you to pick, choose, and play around with to figure out what stratergys go best with your play style. This game also never once holds your hand, expecting you to figure things out on your own and run with it.   If there are any real flaws towards this game, it's base price at times feels a wee steep in my pocket for a 20 stage ( x2 if you count nightmare mode's alt mob waves ) single player experance with maxing out skulls, and climbing the leaderboards the only thing left once done with it. But admittily for $15, you are getting something that looks and plays like a full buget game as well, and that's pretty nice for a new devloper.  Regardless highly recommended.
1659	1	a	Nice game to waste some time. The challenges can be realy hard depending on the equipment you chose. I recommend you get the DLC 'Artifacts of Power' as it contains 2 very powerfull items. Overall its a realy good tower defence game where you sometimes have to fight on more than one frontline at the same time.
1661	1	a	Fun, quirky tower defense game that is simple to pick up, and allows you to defend your castle the way you want to. With all of the DLC(new weapons/traps), you are given a wide array of weapons and traps to set up to help you kill invading orcs. Just take a look around your map, learn the path the orcs are going to be taking to get to your Rift(the 'main base' you're trying to protect, if you will), pick your arsenal for the map, and let it begin! Each Rift will allow only a certain number of orcs to be let through, but let any more than the maximum run through it and it's game over. Campaign lasts a good 7-11 hours depending on how fast you play and how good you become at the game, and then the rest is just playing the game because it is a fun way to pass the time. Recommended for those who enjoy strategical games.
1663	1	a	Is there better way to spend night than slice hordes of orcs? Probably yes, but it wouldn’t be so fun. This is one of games which gave me most fun of all games I played. It has proper mixture of action, fun, creativity and humour. It is not too hard to finish, but same time enough challenging. It has great replayability because offers almost endless possibilities to combine traps and spells to get better score. Game is cheap even at full price, and if you get it on sale as I was it is bargain.
1665	1	a	If you enjoy tower defense, you should dive into this very interactive 3D mass murder, the feeling of having set up a heap of traps to the limit of an unstoppable force, is priceless.
1667	1	a	Tower Defense meets Hack'n Slay Really funny to play and a tip for fans of Sanctum and Dungeon Defenders, traps can be a lot more difficult to choose and place cause each level requires different strategies. But compared to Dungeon Defenders too less possibilities to upgrade stuff and gain new one.
1669	1	a	A truly awesome tower defense style game. Incredibly addictive and can also be a fun party game, hours and hours of fun. The difficulty level actually means something in this game, I would recommend to anyone 95/100 one of the best games in 2011 in my opinion.
1671	1	a	really good action based tower defense games with dark humor and many dead orcs
1673	1	a	Very addictive tower defense game. Easy to play, hard to master. One of the best fun/cost ratio of the year. You must at least try it.
1675	1	a	Highly entertaining at the cost of little time and effort.
1677	1	a	A fun tower-defense/third-person-action game. The story is just a vehicle for funny voice overs and different maps, but the gameplay is great.
1679	1	a	Killing Orcs has never been more satisfying
1681	1	a	Awesome, fun, simple yet strategic. Fast action. Great game!
1683	1	a	an awesome tower defense that has you killing countless orcs in over the top ways you can shoot them burn em melt them crush em how ever you want to do it and the game has humor and personality and its just over the top fun to play this game and its only 15$ as of the time of this review so if your a fan of tower defense games or some one who loves indie games you should give this game a try
1685	1	a	I downloaded the demo on both Steam and XBLA and was so blown away that I jumped at the first sale of the game on Steam and fully intend to get it on XBLA whenever it goes on sale there as well. Definitely one of those 'must own' titles for me.
1687	1	a	this game is a tower defense with some perks too it. dope
1689	1	a	Wacky, wonky and tons of fun. easy to pick up, hard to finish.
1691	1	a	Crazy fun, totally worth it
1693	1	a	Humorous, entertaining and great replayability. A must have for the sequal to unlock the classic levels. (9/10)
1695	1	a	Very Very Fun Game ! ! ! If you are a fan of defence games, action games, or just like dismembering hordes of orcs. This game is for you. Plenty of traps and spells to keep you busy and entertained for hours on end. I love it and can't keep away.  -SirFrontsalot  aka TurboPreston aka Reaper
1697	1	a	Hilarious, fun, wonderful. Worth every penny, action packed and strategic.
1699	1	a	Nice, mindless fun. In the game you play as a war mage that kills orcs. You get cool traps and a few weapons. It's quite satisfying to play too. Only downside is lack of multiplayer, which is present in the second installment - Orcs Must Die! 2. If this game is on sale, I reccoment getting it. Also, getting this game will grant you 10 extra co-op levels in OMD2, however you have to note that both players need this game for them to be playable in the co-op mode.
1701	1	a	I never thought towerdefence and third person mixed well until now
1703	1	a	Great game, lots of fun while killing monsters :)
1705	1	a	This was a very well done action/defence game.   The game has a really nice art stlye and the graphics are nice. I just like the look of the game.  The gameplay Is fluid and well done. The controls are easy to learn. There is a good amount of traps and abilities for you to use on the vast amount of orcs you will be slaying.   Overall the game is fun. I would recommend giving the game a try.
1707	1	a	Fun, inventive tower defense with a wide variety of build paths--not just in terms of the towers and other defensive implements that you deploy, but also the RPG-like paths for upgrading your player character and your ability to participate in the defense first hand. Very satisfying, although the game's 'humor' wears thin almost immediately. Definitely pick this up on a fire sale if you enjoy novel takes on tower defense.
1709	1	a	So much fun! Seriously, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, this is an excellent game that might be one of the most fun out there. Unique weapons, characters and it's also pretty funny.
1711	1	a	Epic first person tower defense fiery crossbow sword wielding flame roasting orc slaying madness. Good Times.
1713	1	a	+ Pretty good fun  - But little bit short  80/100
1715	1	a	This game is very addicting and stessful at times but it is a lot of fun.
1717	1	a	This game is great to play when you want to have a quick fun. Each party does not last more than 20 minutes, so you can play it every now and then.   The gameplay is easy to grasp and the challenge is well balanced so you get the incentive to start over some levels to get all the points.  I'm going for 100% achievements for this game, because it makes me feel like I can do it.  I will do it at my pace, one play at a time, every now and then.  And when I'm done with it, I'll download the sequel to keep the fun going.  That makes for a fun game, that I recommend.
1719	1	a	Tower defensive game with a sense of humour, good fun!
1721	1	a	both strategic and hilarious. great game. I absolutely loved it. Hoping for orcs must die 3
1723	1	a	An addictive 3rd person strategy defense romp. This game throws you into the role of the last warmage defending rift portals against waves of orcs, ogres, goblins and more. The maps make you think carefully about where to place your arsenal of various traps. Traps such as brimstone which scorches the ground or your very own army of elven archers. Some clever cutscenes placed here and there give emphasis on a story, uncommon in this genre. To add to longevity each map has 3 difficulties, leaderboards, and skulls you must earn to improve your traps.  A fantastic game for any fan of action or strategy games!
1725	1	a	If you are looking to have a lot of fun with great humor and no hard thinking, this game is for you! :-)
1727	1	a	A bit repetitive but quite funny. I wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect any deep strategy here, just lots of lightweight mayhem :-)
1729	1	a	An outstanding take on the tower defense genre. The game offers genuine choice as to how to complete levels, and the variety of levels as well as the decent challenge will keep you drawn in. It takes 8-10 hours to finish the campaign with good scores, and then there's Nightmare mode to contend with. Highly recommended.
1731	1	a	This game is surprisinglly addictive. Far superior to Sanctum in my opinion. This game is definately a sleeper hit of this year.
1733	1	a	Fast paced, arcade-y yet surprisingly deep tactical game play. This is 1 to keep.
1735	1	a	Orcs Must Die has, for me, devolved into a 'Must get and retain high score Vs my friends'.... still gotta get that for the first map...  As a fan of both FPS and TD, I very much enjoy this hybrid. Thanks to Kruel Handlebar for introducing me to this....
1737	1	a	Great Tower defense/strategy game, Great fun killing many orcs!
1739	1	a	A very simple premise of a game - stop a whorde of orcs from making it from one end of a maze to another utilizing a couple of weapons and a variety of 'semi-humorous traps.' The orcs come in a series of waves, and those waves get longer and more difficult until the end of each level. As you complete levels, you gain additional types of traps, and the more you succeed, you gain points to spend to upgrade those traps to make them more powerful.  Overall, this is a very simplistic game... first person shooter meets tower strategy. But, it's kind of addicting, as the traps lend a bit of humor in to the fray, often being used to knock orcs around the maze and off ledges - and a variety of other things that aren't worth spoiling for anyone.  Wait for a good Steam Sales (such as the weekend one presently going on) and add the entire franchise to your collection for less than $10. It's definitely worth that for some nearly-mindless entertainment! And, with a Steam-based leaderboard, you can compete with your friends.
1741	1	a	If you are looking for a Insanely fun and bloody TD/TPS,If you like killing orcs,Then this is the game for you! Orcs must die! 1 has many unique traps,weapons,trinkets and spells which you can experiment or play with,I recommend that you play this before you play the sequel because it has a story to it,If you don't like singleplayer tower defense/third person shooters then go over to the sequel if you like :P I want you to grab you're money and buy the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game because it is ♥♥♥♥ing worth it and i like you to play the game for yourself because i don't want to spoil all the stuff it has :P
1743	1	a	Really an amazing game. Various traps, various abilities, various unlockables, and TONS of replayability. So many levels, difficulties, scores, orcs,... Stop reading this and get it.
1745	1	a	this is a fun game that incolces a lot of mayhen and highjinxes but can also challenge your skill.
1747	1	a	A interactive Tower Defense Game that doesn't have you standing around watching the enemies die to your traps. Countless traps are available, use your sword and bow for direct and ranged combat or use powerful trinkets that give you the ability to control certain elements. Examine your surroundings and build the best death trap possible to hold back the Orcish Horde.  Highly addictive and endless amounts of fun. Well worth the $15.
1749	1	a	This is so ace
1751	1	a	Orcs Must Die! GOTY Edition: BRILLIANT! Quippy one-liners, squishy orcs; what more can you ask for? For the extra £3, it's worth getting the GOTY version. It's a 2Gb download, which might take a few hours; but worth it. Graphics: good. Voice acting: Good (the one-liners are quite funny). The game is GOOD! A great defence game. GET IT! 
1753	1	a	Sometimes, I almost feel bad for the Orcs. Except, not really.
1755	1	a	An excellent single player indie game.  Has 3 game modes - warmage, nightmare and high scoring. Played within that order. Once you have completed the game on nightmare you can aim for the highscore tables, but high scores are achieved by getting combo kills, so require entirely different tactics.   The traps are interesting, there are a handful that you will never use and others you will use in some levels. The swinging mace is one of the most deadly traps you can use.  2 DLCs - Lost adventures adds 5 maps, 1 is a map already in the game played in reverse (a very unique map and a very entertaining map, playing in reverse does make it harder). They also added a handful of new monsters, like the frost bat. Well worth getting.   - the second DLC is not as worth while, contains a few new traps and weapons. Accessable from the start of the game as well, which makes the first few levels extremely easy if used.   However, both DLCs are worthing picking up when on offer.
1757	1	a	Now this game I spent hours on my crapy labtop, Just killing the dam orcs all day made my own day.
1759	1	a	its a nice game
1761	1	a	Tower defense meets FPS, really fun.
1763	1	a	Solid twist on the Tower Defense Genre. Good introduction to the series if you get the whole franchise pack. Personally, I prefer the second game because there is significantly more flexibility in your game experience, more weapons, more traps, more levels, and more longevity, but the game is still money well spent. Like killing things with traps and weapons? Check. Like good solid humor? Check Interesting and motivating game soundtrack? Check Like a game that requires strategy and thinking? Check Like mass chaos that puts constant pressure on you? Check Like a overall solid game design concept? Double Check (You will get the partial joke here, if you have ever finished the sequel). Just get the game and play it, and you will understand in less than 5 minutes. Lightning in a bottle.
1765	1	a	It's really fun, definitely worth playing.
1767	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played... No, I'm lying about that, it isn't... But it is a nice idea for a game and hell yeah it's funny. The only thing that is missing - level creator. I would probably have around 200 hours of it right now if it did.
1769	1	a	Extremely fun and addictive. Also a good way to improve your 'thinking outside the box'.
1771	1	a	fun good game... not worth 15 bucks but not so bad for 5-10
1773	1	a	I love this game!  It has lots of levels which will supply you with hours of gameplay.   Every level you get a new spell or trap to use against orcs.  The game has very good graphics and dosn't lag on my $400 computer.  Over all I give it a 10 of 10.
1775	1	a	Perfect casual game. Kick back, relax with your Xbox360 controller and kill some orcs. Whether you decide to build an army of archers and paladins, mine the whole dungeon with spear and arrow traps, become a powerful elemental mage or mix these tactics up - gameplay is always balanced and fair, smooth and fast and addictive.
1777	1	a	Beautiful indie game, if a indie company can make this and charge only 15 dollars, it proves the mass market gaming industry is ♥♥♥♥ed up. This game plays smoother, looks better, and is more fun than most of the crap being released today. did i mention its only 15$ compared to what? 60$ for a average game? 9/10 (-1 point cause they say infinite replayability, but thats only cause of a leaderboard, if it had a survival mode it would be 10/10 definately)
1779	1	a	Great tower defence game.
1781	1	a	Tower Defence game that has a significant Third Person action combat. Just to give you a gauge of how much the action combat impacts the game, it usually makes up 1/4 to 1/3 of my kill count. Makes build and wait a thing of the past.
1783	1	a	A fun fast-paced tower defense
1785	1	a	Almost no replayability and a pretty short game, but it was bloody fun.
1787	1	a	Good tower defense game.
1789	1	a	This game is fun and yet suprisingly stratigic compared to what it looks like upon first glance. While I am only partialy through the game, I have to say that this is a must get if it is on sale.
1791	1	a	Very fun! Very cheap!
1793	1	a	Fantastic game. It's like playing a tower defense in first person. Challenging enough but not so difficult you can't master it and 5 skull every level even on Nightmare mode.
1795	1	a	Delightful, dorky, rambunctious fun. It can get frustrating at times when you lose – but naturally that’s part of the game. I will admit I am disappointed that levels I am doing exceptionally well on seem to be over in a few heartbeats, so that’s somewhat disappointing. Nonetheless (and particularly when on sale), it’s worth considering.
1797	1	a	Not since Lemmings has a game so seamlessly mixed engaging mechanics, humor, cuteness, and gleeful cruelty. 90/100 – PCGamer   I AGREE!
1799	1	a	Good game if you are into tower defense, fps, bruce campbell and dead orcs.
1801	1	a	Orcs Must Die! offers a unique perspective to the tower defense genere. Build your defenses and fight yoru way through swarms of orcs in this 3rd person behind the shoulder tower defense / beat 'em up hybrid game.
1803	1	a	An enjoyable strategy/action game of a single war mage against an orc army. Quite short, but I enjoyed the challenges and uniqueness that came with it.
1805	1	a	This is a brutal TD, Hack n Slash game that blew my mind. Its so damn badass that you cant even imagine it! I bought it for 5 Euros (MediaMarket) plus all dlcs. It runs well and fast on my kind of old computer and its MUST BUY FOR ALL OF YOU TD, STRADEGY AND Hack n slash FANS  9.5/10
1807	1	a	Not to be confused with 'Goblins Must Die' ' Kobolds Must Die' 'Bugbears Must Die' and 'All Dire-Celestial-Vampiric Chairs Must Be Dismantled' Orcs Must Die is a game where I'm awesome. Yes, I am awesome, thank you for asking. The orcs come at me and they must die because I'm awesome. I also don't want to massage corn so there's that too.  I have spinny-whirly dealies and spikey things and make things go BOOM! to make orcs go deader. Because orcs being alive are not being dead enough. They don't like it when you slice and dice them and shoot them and burn them and crush them and fling them and feed them to ogres and get other people to shoot them or slice them. I suggest lightly steamed with a dip of tar as a good option, or maybe filled with bolts. It's really up to you, who is me in this case, and awesome.
1809	1	a	Nice tower defense,with funny voice acting :-) 7/10
1811	1	a	Excellent game, one of the best trap / tower defense type games i've yet to play.  The graphics are good for what it is, the game runs very smooth and is nice and fast paced. Excellent game, certainly worth looking at.
1813	1	a	This ♥♥♥♥ is just some GOOD CLEAN FUN. Must play!  Seriously, great game. Guess you could say it's RPG trap defense. Third person shooter, puzzle, whatev. Damn good gameplay. Smooth as a ♥♥♥♥♥s ♥♥♥. The sequel is even better!  10 / 12
1815	1	a	Loads of fun.
1817	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
1819	1	a	Hate Orcs? Then this game is for you! A mixture of third person hero control, and tower placement. Hectic and insane, funny and cartoony. Orcs will hate this game.
1821	1	a	great game
1823	1	a	Great game. Must-have tower defense game that incorporates third-person shooter very well. Strategy is very necessary then again so is character control. Sweeet!
1825	1	a	One of the best tower defense games out there. It has a lot of variety and you feel rewarded for progressing through the game.  10/10
1827	1	a	This game is AWESOME. Extremely well-polished singleplayer experience full of humor and fun.  The art, the audio, the gameplay, it's all quite solid and well-executed. The maps are significantly varied in layout (though not so much in art style) and all leave room for different strategies and play styles. The game really starts to open up as you unlock more abilities as you progress through the campaign.  I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy singleplayer, action games, and/or tower defense games. There are some pretty crazy sales for it, but honestly I would still feel like I've gotten my money's worth at full price.  The DLC is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, but maybe hold off if it's full price and you haven't fallen in love with the game yet.
1829	1	a	The mechanics for this game are truly brilliant. Animation, interface, sounds, visuals, balancing of weapons...not a whole lot of thinking for the user, but enough to be satisfying. Kudos to the developers for creating something pleasing to both the thinking man and the non-thinking man, and every man in between.
1831	1	a	The main character looks like a cross between Wreck-It Ralph and Jack Black  10/10
1833	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game that takes the point of view behind the actor to be apart of the mayhem. With the rise in popularity in such games in the console market, Orcs Must Die! is a nice addition that brings some new gameplay mechanics to the genre to keep it fresh. It’s fierce, fast paced, and there’s nothing better than killing orcs. Man, orcs are stupid.   http://iamericm.com/2014/04/orcs-must-die-indie-game-review/ 
1835	1	a	Hilarious game pretty much the best part is what the guy is saying. He keeps the mood light so I'm not gnashing my teeth on those hard levels. Buy if you're into FPTower defense things
1837	1	a	Awesome defense plus action game, and amazing soundtrack.
1839	1	a	Probably the most addicting game I have ever played, up there with Star Ocean 2. It's a combination tower defense/3rd person shooter, in which you kill thousands and thousands of Orcs, along with Ogres, Kobolds, Hellbats, etc. Best of all it's extremely cheap, and will give you countless hours of entertainment!
1841	1	a	This game is surprisingly fun.
1843	1	a	this game is like a tower defence on crack, its exstremely fast paced wilst most other TD allow you to take your time and think things out, this one gives you a chance to think out at the beginning but as soon as you start it you gotta run around and spend your points on the fly and it can make you panic at times, which is alot of fun at times
1845	1	a	It's a fairly simple game with a fairly simple concept, but it's fun as ♥♥♥♥. You play as a mage killing orcs in numerous tower defense styled maps, that's it. I give this game a 3/5.
1847	1	a	This is such a great tower defense game. The only thing that is missing is multiplayer, it's well worth the price if you like tower defense / 3rd person defense.
1849	1	a	[]V[]ega-worth getting. Fun, challenging, quick, and easy to play. Challenge yourself and compare to me!!! Buy this game!
1851	1	a	this game it the ♥♥♥♥ its a must buy
1853	1	a	Hordes of Orcs and unlimited traps
1855	1	a	One of the most fun defense games out
1857	1	a	Slaughter at it's best!
1859	1	a	This game is epic! It's so much fun! :) Totally recommended!
1861	1	a	this game is so much fun.
1863	1	a	Leave those poor orcs alone damn it !
1865	1	a	Best Tower Defence game ever
1867	1	a	Very fun take on the castle defense genre. Fans of Dungeon Defender will likely find this to be a must-play.
1869	1	a	great game, challenging, but not impossible :)
1871	1	a	An awesome take on the tower defense genre, and challenging to boot. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is solid, and the traps are fun.
1873	1	a	Very fun and entertaining game! I will definitely buy OMD 2!
1875	1	a	I was hesitant about this game as I find 3rd person views to be very console'ish but was pleasantly surprised. The PC controls are solid and the traps are very satisfying. I wish the levels were longer or you started with more money because it seems like just as you get a really good chain of traps setup then the level is over. That's a minor complaint--overall the game is great.
1877	1	a	Funny game Must buy on sale
1879	1	a	Great tower defense game with lots of action.
1881	1	a	Its a cool game my friend gave it for my bd :D 
1883	1	a	Funny, nice visuals and satisfying combat and trap setting.
1885	1	a	Awesome game for any and all pc gamers.
1887	1	a	
1889	1	a	Very fun game, with a nice sense of humor and a good amount of challenge. Very reccomendable.
1891	1	a	good and fun game. * * * *
1893	1	a	A very amusing and well conceived strategy defense game. Definitely ranks highly on satisfaction. Nothing better than killing thousands and thousands of orcs in very non-repetitive scenarios.
1895	1	a	All kinds of fun - good strategy game with a big leap in dificulty and a nice sprinkle of humor.  Easliy the best £2.99 I ever spent.
1897	1	a	This game is so much fun!!! I highly recommend for some Orc pwnage!
1899	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive!
1901	1	a	Seriously the BEST TOWER DEFENCE game out there. A whole lot of fun.
1903	1	a	This is a brilliant core defence/tower defence mixed with action combat. With the well thought out ability to upgrade perks within the levels, high customisation of object placement and damaging objects already built into the maps ready for you to trigger; this is a must have title for any core defence lovers.  The only downside I have found so far is the inability to foresee what is coming on the next wave so you can plan accordingly.
1905	1	a	What a fantastic game. I really love it. Fast paced action combined with some strategic thinking, a healthy dose of Bruce 'Ash' Cambell style humour. Devilish traps and some well thought out weapons. This game has also really has made me laugh a lot. A very enjoyable and polished game that you can have a quick game of or spend hours playing. So much fun to be had and lots of replay value.
1907	1	a	i got this for 3€ and spend 40 hours of tactical orc slashing, optimizing my trap arrangement. it's fun, buy it. if you like tower defense, this is what you want.
1909	1	a	Great game, bizzaro but awesome mix of FPS and tower defense, definitely worth the sale price!
1911	1	a	A nice tower defence game that makes you scream ORCS MUST DIE!!!!
1913	1	a	This is a fun, action-oriented tower defense game with crisp graphics and good action. I recommend this to anyone.
1915	1	a	I bought this for the Steam Holiday Sale to do the achievement, and found that it was very fun to play. If you're looking for something a little less intenstive than Dungeon Defenders, this is your game.
1917	1	a	I loved this game. Just loved it, can't wait to play the sequal.
1919	1	a	Good game, would recommend!
1921	1	a	very addicting!
1923	1	a	It is very fun. You can hear the Orcs say 'It's my last day before retirement' and than give him a headshot. But if you have (hopefully) friends that play video games i highly recommend you Orcs Must Die! 2, because this is a lot more fun in co-op!
1925	1	a	Had more fun playing this than I've had gaming in some time.  It's fast paced, creative and very funny.  And lets face it, who doesn't like killing orcs with everything from floor spikes to tipping them into acid...
1927	1	a	Better as OMD 2. worth a price.
1929	1	a	OMD1 and OMD2 are great games!   Generally i don't like 3rd person games but have for this series to be a ton of fun.  OMD2 is better of cause with more options, traps and maps.  Good replayablity as i keep coming back for weekly bashes and always keen to try differant trap combos.   Can't think of and negitives, but a first person view would be a nice touch. maybe something for OMD3 Ha!  Highly recomend! 
1931	1	a	Strategy and killing orcs, what more can you ask for?
1933	1	a	This game is very, very entertaining, the objective of the game is to kill orcs, gnolls, kobolds and ogres before they reach the end of the level. We could say this is a light game as is easy to win, however, for getting the perfect mark is another history. Is a strategy game as you can choose which traps, spells and special guardians to use for each level and you can upgrade them as you got better marks in each level. However, if you play in the nightmare mode, the strategy gives places to your skills as everything will change and will be very challenging to finish the game, and worse if you try to get a perfect mark in each level.  More is not enough to say, the game is very addictive, sarcastic history, and probably will be enjoyed by everyone. Thought is a good idea to get all the DLC in one single bundle as will help you. 
1935	1	a	wow what a good game
1937	1	a	Very fun tower defense / action mix! Even for people less enthusiastic about the genre. Very satisfying trap effects, simple but good graphics. Trap diversity ir rarely used though. You can use alot, but often a concentration of 2-3 are the best.
1939	1	a	BOSS this game is BOSS. 
1941	1	a	Great game that offers a lot of fun for a price you wouldn't expect it!  ... and killing Orcs never gets boring!
1943	1	a	Pretty Bad ♥♥♥
1945	1	a	I don't know why orcs have to die :'( . It makes me sad...
1947	1	a	Low price but hours of fun. Great game! 3D tower defense category with lot of very original traps and action!
1949	1	a	Amazing!! I played this on my friends PC and bought it without a single thought!! lol
1951	1	a	It's like lemmings, except instead of babying them along you kill them in a creative way. Oh it's tower defense too.
1953	1	a	Kill Orcs NOAW!!!!!!!!  Lovely game if you like some melee/range combat fused with traps. It's a bit of a tower defense if you ask me.
1955	1	a	This is a fun game but it's definitely quirky.  + Interesting level design + Configurable upgrades with Weavers  - Some levels way too open with too few options to build defenses - You can't refund skulls; so you anticipation/guessing plays into unlocking items - You can't redefine keys (defaults to WASD) which is ... short-sighted - No option to create your own maps 
1957	1	a	This is the kind of game that you can find yourself losing hours to because it is just so much fun to watch the carnage! A great combination of FPS and tower defense strategy, with a sense of humor that is rare in most games. From the first voice-over, it doesn't take itself too seriously and rather enjoys the absurd action for what it is. 
1959	1	a	Approved!
1961	1	a	If you like Tower defense games, this is worth the $15!! Quoting one of the Orcs 'I'm just a day away from retiring!' LOL!
1963	1	a	
1965	1	a	its a medevil game and also a magical game Its preaty awsome and is a survival sort of game i recommend the game 10/9.6
1967	1	a	The most fun i've had playing a game in ages. Great for pick-up-and-play after a long day by just chunking orcs to bits, but the nightmare mode and leaderboard rankings actually require a lot of strategy and forethought. Have played it for countless hours (well, ok... 33 in two weeks) and have gotten 5 skulls on every level on NIGHTMARE... and that this is from a guy who can't even be bothered togo back and finish the last level in MGS4 because it would require fiddling around behind the TV to plug it in which should tell you all about how addictive and enjoyable it is.
1969	1	a	Very fun mix of combat and tower defence, very funny humor, and challenging. Great game aside from not having multiplayer (the 2nd one will).
1971	1	a	So much fun. Wish I could have more orcs and more money.
1973	1	a	Orcs + Traps = Bloody Fun
1975	1	a	Great game
1977	1	a	Tons of Orcs, tons of fun, plays like dream — get this one!
1979	1	a	Fun but very challenging, or maybe I'm just bad at it.
1981	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a real gem of an indie game. It offers a creative take on the tower defense genre with plenty of options to approach each challenge. The mixture of strategy and action game elements coupled with tight controls flow together very well, leaving you with one very satisfying experience. The game also has a good sense of dark humor that, while it may get repetitive at some points, has yet to come across as annoying.  All in all, I highly recommend this game. If you love the tower defense genre you shouldn't think twice about getting it. The game offers a great experience that is well worth the price and is still fun to play again and again.
1983	1	a	It you like tower defence action games, you have to play this one!
1985	1	a	Great fun and easily worth 14€ . Easy to play and just the right amount of challenge.
1987	1	a	Kind of a Tower Defense game. Except you use traps, and you attack yourself too. Running around, shooting, stabbing, and exploding stuff.  It is a ton of fun, a crap ton of unique levels. At least try the demo!  WARNING: EXTREMELY FRIGGN ADDICTING
1989	1	a	kinda like Lord of the Rings 
1991	1	a	This game is seriously addictive and very fun. If you enjoy tower defense games and always wished you could be down there to get that damn last straggler, this is your game. Tons of replay value, and quite funny to boot. Make sure you get the artifacts of power DLC though, that stuff is great!
1993	1	a	+ Great story ! + Awesome art and characters ! + Great weapons and traps ! + hours of story  + The only tower of defence game i like &lt; trust me thats an achivement !  ------- IF YOU GRAB THIS BE SURE TO GET GOTY OR ALL DLC --------- without them its just a little less fun but all those are worth your money !
1995	1	a	Fun, but has DLC...so I'd give it 6/10
1997	1	a	If killing orcs is wrong I don't want to be right.
1999	1	a	Murdering thousand of stupid orcs with gory traps? What's not to love?
2001	1	a	Yo dawg I heard you like killin' orcs so we put some traps in your fortress so you can kill orcs while you kill orcs.
2003	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredibly fun, fast paced tower defense game with emphasis on action. You play a War Mage just out of his apprentice training, who must stop orcs from reaching the rifts into your world.  With your old master dead, a cocky attitude, and not the greatest intelligence your kind has ever seen. The world is surely doomed.
2005	1	a	A masterpiece, must have !
2007	1	a	This game's a cult hit, and it deserves to be. Vibrant graphics (though you're indoors all the time), great humor, great gameplay (exactly what you expect) and enough of a challenge for anyone.
2009	1	a	What a great twist on the tower defense genre. This game will have you killin orcs for hours
2011	1	a	I didn't exspect this game to be this good boy was i wrong! Buy this game now ,trust me on this one
2013	1	a	love the game
2015	1	a	pretty good.
2017	1	a	If you can pick this up cheap, its worth a weekend of fun. 3rd person shooter with Tower Defense style gameplay. Set traps and use them to stop the horde from comming through.
2019	1	a	Extremely fun and well polished game. Must have for any Tower Defence player who also enjoys being in the thick of the action.
2021	1	a	I, for one, do not condone the genocide of these orcian refugees, but these radical orc terrorists keep trying to cross into our land! We can't have that, now can we?
2023	1	a	This is my new personal favorite amongst all 3rd-person tower defense games!!! Great fun, but unfortunately only singleplayer.
2025	1	a	A great time consumer! Poor Orcs... Not! :) +like this game
2027	1	a	Too hard. Have to be MLG like me to have any fun whatsoever.
2029	1	a	Forget the later OMD games, this is the one you want.
2031	1	a	If you watch the trailer you know what you are getting. Cartoonish entertainment and high speed action. If you like the trailer, you`ll like the game. At least I did
2033	1	a	FANTASTIC, simple, tower defense game. Upgrading your tools/traps leads you to replay levels and dominate the levels more efficiently to get better ratings for more upgrades. It's an addicting formula with a great sense of humor mixed with gratuitous violence. If only there were more levels out there..
2035	1	a	when you like RPG titles,you must buy this game 10/10(i never see game like this)
2037	1	a	really addicting tower defense game and can really get u thinking
2039	1	a	BLANK TIME KILLER.
2041	1	a	Watch 'em dyin'
2043	1	a	This is without a doubt the best tower defense game I've played. Lots of fun, and the one liners add a lot of humour.
2045	1	a	While I admit this game is quite fun, it's just not as enjoyable as it would be if it had multiplayer. Worth it? If you don't mind doing everything by your lonesome.
2047	1	a	Great Indie Tower Def game. Havent had this much fun and laughed at game in a long time!
2049	1	a	You can kill Orcs, IGN 9/10
2051	1	a	An absolute gem! Tower defence mixed with 3rd person shooter and rpg elements. The game is also hilarious, seemless, and the mechanics are fluid and easy to grasp, yet hard to master. There is more than one way to pass each level.   A friend bought me this game as a joke when it was on sale, and it ended up taking over our lives for a few months! Think about how much fun your $10 will buy you at a movie theater or a coffee shop... I guarantee this game will give you way more fun for less money.
2053	1	a	This game is fun and awesome.
2055	1	a	Funny, and fill the time, when i need some crazy destruction
2057	1	a	Traps, fast thinking, lot of fun, good humor. It's a must have in your library. Get it when it's on special at worst you won't regret it.
2059	1	a	Just some pure, unadulterated fun. One of those games where you say you'll do one level then it turns out to be three hours later. It's tons of fun and the fact that you unlock a new trap or ability after every level just makes it that much better. Only gripe might be that I can't seem to be able to control my computer's volume while in game. But it is still loads of fun.
2061	1	a	Who wants to have fun killing orcs? Everyone, that's who. Few things are more satisfying that setting up deadly traps and watching orcs be violently ripped apart, sliced and crushed with wonderful cartoony blood and guts splattering everywhere. And who doesn't love cartoon gore? No one, that's who. I'm not really into the tower defense genre myself, but this game is not one to pass up. Fast paced action and dasterdly traps await you. It's also the first game that allowed me the pleasure of hearing a ten year old girl cackle madly after filling her spellbook with nasty traps and proclaim, 'It's so easy to be evil!'  Yes it is, small female human. Yes it is.
2063	1	a	A ton of fun and so much satisfaction after a Victory! Not very difficult. The hardest Wave is mostly the first. But still challenging with a Nightmare Mode I haven't tested yet.
2065	1	a	1 time i played i could not stop its like abc mouse if you have seen the comercials they say there child just can not stop and i can not stop so its a great game in all i just got a regular computer and its smoother than jazz.I love this game!!!!!!!  :) :)
2067	1	a	Awesome and fun game! Killing orcs is simply amazing!
2069	1	a	bought on sell for 1$, best deal ever. great fun for a 1$
2071	1	a	If you're after a fun casual challenging but not serious game this is for you! Writing this review I'm only 3hrs into it and love it I definitely recommend this game purely just off how fun it is.   8/10
2073	1	a	extra fun with controller
2075	1	a	Killing orcs. What's not to like?
2077	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
2079	1	a	Serious fun! Fantasy genre meets Plants vs. Zombies. Lay traps to destroy orcs! Fight orcs! Smash! I can't believe I got this game on sale for so cheap! Fast paced good times!
2081	1	a	Great game - exactly what I had hoped Dungeon Defeneders would be. Just the right weight of game for me - not too heavy/long, but not so light/simple that it isn't fun.
2083	1	a	'I could do this all day!' says the hero and it's true!
2085	1	a	So addictive!!!!
2087	1	a	Buy this, for ze Toxo recommends slaying of orcs with traps and spells.
2089	1	a	This is awesome! Only thing it is lacking, whish is a major thing.. is cooperative gameplay!
2091	1	a	These orcs must die, will you aid us?
2093	1	a	Fun game if you have nothing to do, haven't touched in a while though ^_^
2095	1	a	Fun, clever, and just the right amount of arcady. I hope they make more like it.
2097	1	a	This game is much more fun than it has any right to be. It's a blend of the Tower Defense and First Person Shooter genres, it's extremely frenetic, and the main character is an entertainingly over-the-top ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you're not sure about it, grab it when it's on sale; it's a pretty minor investment for a solid game.
2099	1	a	4 out of 5... cool traps, decent different types of enemys. NOT MANY LEVELS... you can get many more from dlc I think u should try this game
2101	1	a	Tower defense game mixed with first person shooter. Funny comments in game. Plays really well. Three difficulty levels provide great challenge.  [my ranking: 6.5/10]
2103	1	a	Nice change up from the Tower Defense genre with the added fun of an FPS! I've spent plenty of hours on this already.
2105	1	a	+nice graphics &amp; art style +well optimised and constant frame rate +simple game premise well executed +cheap +can fling orcs onto spears to impale them +replay value - trying different tactics   -repetitive
2107	1	a	Very fun game with a good variety of towers to choose from.
2109	1	a	Fun game, tower defense w/FPS twist. I wish it was multiplayer though. Still worth it.
2111	1	a	What a refreshing taste of Castle Defence. If you are a Castle Defence fan, this will be an amazing experience. 5/5 for sure.
2113	1	a	Simple gameplay but very enjoyable and replayable.
2115	1	a	Not a good port, seems better suited to xbox arcade or something. Still liked it however. Get it cheap.
2117	1	a	Very good and fun 3rd person tower defense game. I love it.
2119	1	a	It's a good game if you like to place traps and have several options to win.
2121	1	a	I've never killed so many orcs in my life!
2123	1	a	An educational game for the entire family.
2125	1	a	no one get this game
2127	1	a	
2129	1	a	Amazing Bruce Campbell-esk main character? Check. Mindblowing trap combinations? Double check. Lots of Orcs? Like you have to ask...
2131	1	a	This game is surprisingly clever, and a fantastic tower defense game.
2133	1	a	Funny as all living hell.
2135	1	a	It\'s hard but fun.
2137	1	a	Great game. Has enough trap/weapons to make replaying levels interesting by trying different strategies each time. Character dialog is funny.
2139	1	a	This game is vomiting painful but enjoyable
2141	1	a	Achievement Hunter Review: An incredibly fun tower defense/third-person hybrid. Took me around 20 hours to 100% as the first game of its style that I've played.
2143	1	a	If you don't like this game, you do not like having fun. Get it, it's worth every penny. The DLC is pretty good too.
2145	1	a	Tower defence in a nutshell. You protect a portal from invading orcs that come via air or ground. You have several traps at defending this portal at your disposal. As you progress in the game you can upgrade these traps and gain access to more. As the hero, you are capable of assisting the traps with a crossbow, a sword, or magic which can also be upgraded as you progress.
2147	1	a	My all time favorite tower defense type game. The price is too cheap for it's worth. Love the style and the humor in the game. The only flaw that I can find on this game, there's no Co-Op.
2149	1	a	Клана игруха.   Awesome tower defense game. Strict but fun balance. Lots of traps weapons and spells. Highly recommend it.
2151	1	a	so whats the point of this game you ask? duh. kill everything the combat? you just shoot and slice EVERYTHING you see thats soon-to-not-be-alive! the traps. omg the traps are sssssssssoooooooooo AWESOME at killing stuff!   ...but...   the story (sigh) the story in ssssssssssssooooooooo awful but this is still a great game so 9/10
2153	1	a	Surprisingly funny game. You're a young battlemage, who uses his crossbow and tons of traps, to hold back incomming waves of orcs. Though it sounds like a standard Tower-Denfese game, it personally reminded me of Dungeon Keeper 2. I approve!
2155	1	a	This game ts like Dungeon Defenders but i kinda consider this game much better since you have the ability to place traps pretty much anywhere (ceiling, walls, and floors).   What this game dosent have though is co-op and can make the game quite boring after awhile of playing it...still fun though...  you also can't remap the controls for this game  ---My Rating--- 7.3/10
2157	1	a	If you are debating whether to get the 1st or 2nd game, get the 2nd or the 2nd and the 1st. If you get both (get them on sale and it'll only be around $4 total), you get extra levels and DLC.   Also be warned that the first game has super high mouse sensitivity, so if you don't have a very small mousepad or super slow mouse DPI, get the 2nd game.
2159	1	a	OMG, best game ever you will like it so much, just buy the game you will not regret buying this game
2161	1	a	Pretty much a 3d version of those 2d flash games where you upgrade and progress through endless waves of killing ♥♥♥♥. It also has some strategic challenges, so its fun to play on a rainy day
2163	1	a	Fun little game. Easy to pick up and just play. Snag it if its on sale.
2165	1	a	Fun new take on TD games.
2167	1	a	An utterly fun game, Orcs Must Die! combines FPS with placing down traps. Probably not a new idea, but that doesn't in any way, shape, or form detract from the enjoyability, so let's get into some pros and cons.  Pros -It has some story elements (a big thing with me). This game could have gone without story altogether and still been fun, but the developers decided to spice it up! I mean, sure it's a pretty basic story, but, considering the game genre, I'll consider it a pro. -Responsive and intuitive controls that are easy to learn and get the hang of. -Normal (Warmage) difficulty getting boring? Try Nightmare difficulty for the challenge you crave. -Great music and graphics. -Great replayability across most levels (I say most because the first level, even on Nightmare, will get easy pretty quick). -Funny commentary from the characters. -DLC adds new weapons, traps, and levels.  Cons -No multiplayer. If you're not into that then this point is moot. -Only one character and set of weapons/traps. -DLC costs money. Might be a con to some. I wasn't personally bothered by it, but, then again, I probably got it on sale 'cause I'm cheap like that.  So, yeah, that's all I got. So go get it. It's worth its full price, but if you want to get it on sale, that's understandable. Anyways, it's a great game I would recommend to just about everyone.
2169	1	a	Got this game in the sale, would have been worth it full price though.   Simple and fun.
2171	1	a	Best tower defense-style game ever. Still holds true to this day.
2173	1	a	fun tower defence game
2175	1	a	This is where it all started, Orcs fighting rpg tower defence type of story yaq know.
2177	1	a	A hidden gem on Steam. Definitely worth the 4 bucks I paid to play it.
2179	1	a	Still one of the best 'tower defense' out there. Solid gameplay with equal hilarity to match. I highly recommend giving this game a shot :)
2181	1	a	I am having a blast. planning and shooting required, fun granted
2183	1	a	Very orc
2185	1	a	ORCS ARE HUGE, THAT MEANS THEY HAVE HUGE GUTS! SPIKES AND TAR, SPIKES AND TAR!
2187	1	a	Easily the best 15 bucks I've ever spent :)
2189	1	a	This game is not a casual game. OMD is deceptively challenging and ramps in difficulty pretty quickly in only a few levels; it's nothing rage inducing unless you are a perfectionist seeking a perfect skull score on each level (compare it to getting full stars in Angry Birds).   At it's core it's an ultra-competitive score attack arcade game and is best played as a marathon rather than in short bursts as you'll have time to warm up and eventually play at your best.   Pros: - Smooth gameplay - No spoonfeeding - Great balance between budgetting, planning, setting up traps and commencing the action - Replay value  Cons: The game has a number of annoyances but nothing worthy of including in this review. Simply put they could have tweaked certain things a bit more for my taste.  Note: If you don't have a strong fan for your PC be wary of overheating.
2191	1	a	dumbass war mage+orcs+traps+magick crossbow+magick sword+more rediculous traps=♥♥♥♥tons of dead orcs  but seriously this game is awesome, its a hero defense game, stop orcs getting from a to b using traps soldiers or slaughter them yourself, i had lots of fun playing it
2193	1	a	Very entertaining. You can lose several hours easily with this games.  As a mix of TPS, tower defense (but with traps) and strategy its a game where you have to think a bit which traps are best and where is the best place to use it.  If your not a tower defense player this game might get a bit boring after a few lvls.  But overall its a very nice game.
2195	1	a	This was a really great game; dynamic gameplay, somewhat developed characters, and a variety of mobs to slice and dice. The traps are good, but I definitly fell into a pattern of which to use/which were the most useful. Definitly good, pick it up!
2197	1	a	The Orcs jut nedz moar dakka WWWAAARRRGGG!!!!
2199	1	a	My pick for Orc murder simulator GotY. Smooth, polished, and tons of fun.
2201	1	a	Really enjoyed this game, even more than it's sequel.
2203	1	a	uhh you kill orcs... funny ways... do it..... buy it.... now....  I am hobo and I approve this message
2205	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. No, really. Try the demo. Awesome tower defense gameplay coupled with great hack 'n' slash, burn 'n' bash combat.  If you think the demo is awesome, wait until you hear this: a little less than one third of the way into the campaign, you unlock the Weavers, performance enhancing mages who let you choose a tree of enhancements: your weapons, or your traps (this includes guardians and soldiers). Personally I'm a fan of the combat enhancements. With the double ended bladestaff, and all the melee enhancements, you'lll tear through the orc hordes like a hurricane of blood.   I've tried the Trap tree, but because both traps and the perks cost money, where as with the combat you only have to pay for the perks, I find that the trap tree often takes longer to upgrade, and even with the perks you'll often still have to depend on weapons a fair amount.  All in all, this game kicks ♥♥♥. Buy it.
2207	1	a	Great mix of action and tower defense! Music is awesome and it's just plain hilarious!
2209	1	a	Do you like killing orcs? what about gnolls, ogres and kobolds? what about using traps to cut them, pinch, burn, slice, throw, and crush them, all that sprinkled with some magic spells; kill orcs, be creative doing it, have fun.
2211	1	a	It's like a tower defense, but you play it as a third person game. You still build up various types of defensive mechanisms that help you prevent the enemy from getting to your base. It feels fresh and innovative, while not consuming too much of your time if you don't want it to. Good for a simple time passer or playing for a long time.
2213	1	a	Fantastic Gameplay with great tactical elements, a tower defense masterpiece without the towers, where the sole objective is to use the myrid arsenal of traps and weapons to stop waves of half brained, one liner spouting Orcs.  
2215	1	a	I rate the game 9 out of 10, 10 if there was a multiplayer option. Must buy!
2217	1	a	Orcs Must Die!, another game I got AFTER the 2nd in the series.  Guess what?  I'm doing it wrong.  But anyway, great story with amazing voice acting, especially the effects of the sorceresse's voice. Another Gr8 r8 8/8 m8. Thx! :D
2219	1	a	This game is great!!!
2221	1	a	Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist. Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes. The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace. The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy! The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the 'skull ranking' system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment.
66	0	a	There is a lot of good things in Reincarnation, but the AI and map progression issues have not been resolved from the previous versions.  In general:  The Good: -Fun races, lots of units, nice strategic approach. -Nice Music. -Graphically appealing, while not being demanding. Well Optimized. (Not last gen tough). -Good Campaign Storyline. -Almost no bugs or glitches (so far). -Leveling system is addictive and dynamic. Can have different builds.  The Bad: -Horrible AI. Seriosuly.  -Strategic approach is fine, execution is terrible. Weird and unfair issues with CPU enemies. -Extremely slow paced gameplay. -Difficulty is based 100% in the raw power of the enemy armies and it scales poorly as the game goes on. -Once behind it's almost impossible to recover.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, explaining with more detail:  1.- Disciples is a franchise that relies heavily into the management of the encounters you have. The main strategy of the matches rely heavily in how you develop your troops WITHOUT DYING, mainly because the game punishes you hard if you loose a leveled squad. In the past, this kind of difficulty was appealing, but by today standards, it's just not well implemented. The game is more about choosing the right targets to level up and not about the strategic combat. This means that the difficulty is developed by the way you approach the leveling and not about the challenge of battling or developing the resources.  2.- The AI is just broken.  During the map phase, all the enemy armies just clean the mobs and level up in a certain rate, making few mistakes, while you need to see your way trough the random neutral troops that can range from easy to impossible. While the idea of having a linear leveling experience is boring, making you roam the map searching for the right mobs seems hardly an improvement. This is worsened by the fact that you can't afford to loose a single troop from the squad, so you will be repeating certain battles just for the sake of keeping the squad alive and not loose time in healing (wich, too, can be punishing in certain situations). And you can add to this the fact that while you loose time choosing targets, the AI already knew the right path so now it's 3 levels abobe you and still power-clearing camps.  In combat is worse. Melees will approach to engage, ranged will target the nearest high priority target (weakest). No much variation there. All the difficulty relies in you having to clear the lesser troops because usually the neutral enemies will have an outstanding threat that you need to carefully engage if you don't want to get one-shotted. And that is all. It's an easy clean or a fight you will have to repeat until the mobs behave the way you needed or until certain platforms that give you power spawn in better positions for you (wich ends up being the only strategy that the field of battle provides and that is completely random. The AI will rarely use them well).  -While fun and useful when you level and clear the map, spells are rather secondary. They can be extremely necesary in certain maps that have incredible neutral camps difficulties; and be just a fun thing to do in other scenarios.   Don't get me wrong with this review. Reincarnation is still a good game. It pretty much is a revamp of disciples 2 with a new combat system that is not really that cool. But i can hardly recommend it with all the issues it haves. Gaming has gone a long way from the games that had broken gameplay and weird AI issues. D3 should have been the improvement in those departments and not just the downfall because they not only couldn't fix them but maked them worse.  There were other minor issues, but i settled with the most important in my opinion. To do this review i waited to play enough time, but now I felt like I was ready to give an honest, objective opinion about the game.  Cheers! 
2223	1	a	Disciples 3 was a misguided affair. Buggy, unbalanced trying too much to copy from Heroes of Might and Magic it strayed far for Disciples 2. Reincarnation is an attempt to redo the game. Most bugs were squashed, balancing was redone, battlefields were made much smaller (so it is closer to D2 choice of who to attack instead of running around the field). If you haven't played D2, do so, it is still a much better game. But if you played D2 to death, this version of D3 is actually quite decent. Unfortunately the developer went bankrupt before they finished a planned Mountain Clans DLC so this faction is missing.
2225	1	a	Someone needs to give the team/person who worked on this version of Disciples 3 and give him the money he needs to finish the game properly. Dwarfs are missing, I know the history on how the developer went bankrupt and all, but here is an example of a team/person who knows how to develop this series. Sad that good franchises end this way. I hope someone will continue this one. Reincarnation is great, but could be much better if this would have been the first one out instead of the prior ones before this.  If you are new to the Disciples series get this one and not the others and you will enjoy it, well worth the current price. If you are a long time fan well it is not Disciples 2 but, as I you may come to like this version of Disciples 3. Worth the price to try and see.
67	0	a	Disappointing again. It's no wonder this studio has crashed and burned.  As a longtime fan of the Disciples franchise who has been with the games since first release, I was excited for months after hearing about Renaissance. Like a lot of folks, I was legitimately upset by the poor quality of the finished game: Other than the beautiful graphics, nothing was right. The feel of the old games was gone along with the Mountain Clans and Undead Hordes factions, and gameplay was plagued by bugs and design flaws. I bought Resurrection in the hope that it might include patches and balancing to fix the vanilla game, and was let down again.  When I saw Reincarnation in the Steam store, I managed to get excited yet again, and bought it on impulse.  If you like Disciples, don't make that mistake.  Gameplay is smoother and the game runs a little better, yes, but the combat alone is ten times as frustrating. I can't count how many times I've loaded a save because just one or two low-level enemy units can chew through your entire force, in campaign mode. Also changed for the worse is the character advancement system, where previously units would upgrade into new, more powerful forms so long as you had the proper structure built in your capital; now, units must level up 3 times before transforming. Good luck surviving that long, and that's from a veteran player and a pretty decent TBS tactician.  Overall, even with improvements, Reincarnation is almost too exhaustingly irritating to play, especially in the long sessions for which you might normally enjoy a TBS.  4/10
2227	1	a	Although this says on the store page it was released on 14 Feb 2014 it has actually been on steam for a long time, it's just that there was no store page for it. It was sold on other online stores with a steam key.  The developers of this game are no more so there will likely be no kind of support. There have been problems running it in the past, see the old steam thread hub:   http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=251   Having said that, it is a good game and I prefer it to Might and Magic: Heroes VI.  Wait for a 75% off sale though- it's a year and 9 months or so old and has been 75% off a fair few times before now.
2229	1	a	Worse than Disciples 2, better than Heroes 6
2231	1	a	They took everything what's good in disciples 3 and entirely rebalanced it to make good disciples chapter and good game in general, they significantly improved writing and level design and they gave it for free for owners of both previous disciples 3 games.  Global strategy aspect is still lost, but now each individual battle is better than in disciples 2, so in the end it's on par with disciples 2.   There are still couple of weird scripts and bugs here, but in general game runs totally fine and smooth, also works with nvidia surround. The most notable bug is what they changed in undead campaign final boss, check guides to possible workaround for that.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=574495826   It's a pity that dwarves, orks and merfolk expansions to the third game would never be made, there was also possibility for barbarians and bandits expansions.
2233	1	a	I'm mixed about this game. I've been polaying it for quite a while, but somehow I can't seem to either love it nor hate it.  First of, I love this style of game. You control a hero and a small party, and you walk on a fogged map discovering locations, enemies and quests. I've had a lot of fun with a similar one (Expeditions: Conquistador) and so I thought I'd try this one out.  You start with a kind of cliche history about demons, the end of the world and all that. Since I'm not a native english speaker, I felt like they could've added sulbtitles so I wouldn't get so lost and disconnected about the history. After the intro, you get a nice tutorial, which explains pretty much all the basics of the game (altough the different factions and units are not explained at all, so each one you play with you'll have to see it for yourself what suits you better by trial and error). After that, you're all set to play the campaign.  First of, I think the narrator did a very nice job. All of them read pretty nicely the texts that open each act from each faction. Problem is, that's al lthe voice acting you get. The rest is just at the beggining or after battles and it's the same sound over and over again. The history is presented to you at the beggining of the acts and while playing them, by non spoken dialogue.  For me the game started fun (on hard mode), I would walk and take my time to kill every monster and discover every part of the map (which is what the developers wanted, I guess). But some monsters are impossible to beat on any given map on the early stages of the game, even with a full party with max lvl soldiers.  The graphics are neither top notch nor bad, they fit decently into the game's theme. Only visual problem I had was with some long dialogues being cut by the 'continue' buttom you must press after each characther has spoken. So you kind of miss some information. Couldn't the devs have made a scroll bar or just have the person say something in two dialogues instead of one?  Anyways, the fun I've had in the previous 30 hours gave place to a feeling of boredom. I mean, after all you just go from map to map doing the same thing over and over, there are two or three secondary quests tops and the only thing keeping you forward is a little piece of history given to you before each act. And there are a lot of acts from all the factions. So you play each act for about 5 hours or more (if you kill every guy like me) and then there is 5 more lines of history and then 5 more hours doing the same thing. It gets boring pretty fast, especially if you don't like this kind of game.  What keeps it better is that you can kind of 'auto-resolve' a battle to make the game run faster, but the AI is so stupid that even aganist the weakest enemies you can lose one or two soldiers because the AI chooses to advance with only one guy aganist 7, even though you have 5 guys to attack (Idk why its so stupid since the AI of the enemy computer, altough not very bright, isn't that stupid).  My veredict is that, if you like this kind of strategy games, give this one a try, especially if on sale. I'll be fun for quite a while. But be warned that you'll be bored before knowing how the history ends. If you're going to go all the way to the end is up to you. I, myself, don't know if I will.
2235	1	a	Highly recommend this game. For those who disappointed with Renaissance and Ressurection, this game is nothing like those 2. The developers made very good revisions and improvements before they go down, and it really worth it. The biggest issue is game balance, and it can be easily adjust through modding as the game is very customizable, and you dont need to be a computer geek to learn to mod. There are plenty of mods in the forum that fix game errors, bugs, and imbalance, and bring in new elements to game play.   The only real downside of the series is the discontinuation of the Mountain Clan. I hope that the game will generate enough sales so that it can be continued, and our favorite Mountain Clan can see the light of day.
76	0	a	I only blame steam for selling a game that doesnt have support , or atleast they should mention ' warning this game doesnt have a support ' it crashes for me as soon as i start it and at the menue the game crash and something writen in weird language apeare , I posted in the forum but no replay then i found out this game doesnt have support so if you are lucky it will work and if you have any issues thats it you lost what you paid ( sorry for my horrible english -_-)
2237	1	a	Both games Renaissance and Ressurection are combined here, plus a few extra maps for good value. Sadly, however, the combat system has been 'tweaked' yet again, and is fiddly and time consuming. Originally it was the simnplicity of the combat system that gave this game its appeal. They honestly did not need to change it. Former fans of Heroes of Might And Magic, who had abandoned that game as it became so childish, flocked to this in preference. Still a game I would recommend, but I'd actually suggest buying the two stand-alone games mentioned above, instead of the combined package here. A classic example of how sometimes change is not for the better.
77	0	a	Nothing really new in this version of the game, i was hoping to find new faction and/or units, in fact no. A new campaign is okay, but i was hoping to find a bit more for this price.  if you haven't played to Disciple 3, this version is okay but if you've played to the others, spend your money on another game, trust me
2239	1	a	I love TBS, why are there so few of them?? Even less are worth playing. Fortunately Disciples is one of them. Recommend
2241	1	a	Akella sure knows how to confuse people with their Disciples 3 series. You got Renaissance, Resurrection and now Reincarnation. Well for me all goes as i can't get enough of this series, with game killing bugs and ridicilous difficulty spikes and all. Hard not to recommend (with caveats) this series to veterans of Disciples 2 as this one is now the one that Disciples 3 was supposed to look like.   Renaissance was not bad even though it had game killing bugs and certain 'press button to win' -tactics that is just an abomination when talking about wicked hard games like earlier Disciples games. Resurrection was a disaster. Don't even think about playing that one as it had game bugs that include graphics card glitches, unrealistic level up requirements and difficulty that went trough the roof once more. Reincarnation on other hand is the most recent one and it contains all the campaigns you need.   Disciples 2 remastered would be the best thing ever but until that happens this game will have to do. At least one does not get PTSD playing Reincarnation. Sometimes....do i dare to say it... the mood is quite 'casual' and you can just enjoy the terrible fates of the main characters.
2243	1	a	Having played Disciples II and all 3 versions of Disciples III, I have mixed feelings about Reincarnation. I prefer the larger arena's of Disciples Renaissance over the smaller Arena's in Reincarnation. The one advantage of small arenas is the battle seems more personal. The downside is in larger arenas you could have a couple small battles within the arena, and obstacles would have a greater impact. The dev's claim that Reincarnation's maps are more open. I don't agree, the maps seem even more cluttered. The only difference is you may have a shortcut path to cut across between 2 longer paths. The paths are still extremely linear. The seas ended up just being rivers and are as linear as you can get.  Reincarnation does have more settings that help to tailor the game to a player's preferences. An example is a setting to adjust attack animations within the arena. They have added some skills to the thief or fixed skills that didn't work correctly in previous versions. Certain arena skills are now triggered by critical hits or other events. This maybe helps the ai slightly but does not add any new strategy to combat.  The lighting and shadows are improved but then they decided to have the shadows rotate 90 degrees every 1/4 day. This begins to get annoying after 50 turns. I wish they would have had a feature to turn this off. Another design decision I don't like is that you can't zoom out as far on the worldmap as you could in Renaissance. To me, this makes the game feel less epic in scale. It also hints to the fact that this version really has no world map strategy to consider. You can only see about 7 move points out from your hero in any given direction.  If this had been my first version of D3, the graphics would have really impressed me. However, since I had already played 2 versions of the game, it was no surprise. Personally I don't think it any better than Renaissance. It has a different flavor, some new units. I feel Renaissance never got a fair shake because it was released essentially in beta state. Renaissance patched to 1.02 is as good in its own right as Reincarnation. I don't like that the dev's made 3 separate versions of the same game. It is because there are things I like better from each version, so when I play either one, I always miss something from the other version.   Reincarnation is not quite as moddable as previous versions as system files can not be modded.  Pros - New units include 5 new orc types, wild boar, and a few sea creatures.  - Stellar Graphics that aid in creating a totally immersive environment.  - Same campaign is slightly rewritten and takes place on new maps.  Cons - Tutorial is close to useless  - Still very linear maps even if they have a couple more shortcut paths  - You can usually take as many turns as you need before attacking difficult enemies.  
2245	1	a	Don't waste your money on the buggy broken Renaissance/Ressurection versions. This here is THE version to buy. Completely rehauled from the ground up, with entirely new balance, campaigns, and even new types of abilities(cast on hit/cast when hit etc) it is everything disciples 3 should have been. I can not recomend this game enough to anyone who likes turn based strategy. This game puts HOMM to shame.
79	0	a	Get Age of Wonders 3 instead, no question. The campaigns here are badly paced, the skirmish maps FORCE your race choice, 'counterattack' is called 'intercept' even though it happens second, and the map and fighting are 97% HoMM. AoW3 is more like a prettier Fallen Enchantress.
80	0	a	Not the same as Disciples 2, combat sucks and story is boring.
2247	1	a	This is definitely a step up from their initial release with Renaissance. Basically every aspect seems to have been improved and campaign maps tweaked. Quite a few new side quests have been added as well :) Totally worth it on a 50% or better sale!
2249	1	a	Reincarnation, indeed. It feels like the game was reborn. Visually, it's the same. Internally, it's a new game.  It has become more complex, more complicated in terms of combat: party-to-party battles are more diverse, action-filled, and enjoyable now. RPG elements grew a bit stronger, being felt more distinctly than before. But what's the most important, endless bugs that haunted the players of original  Disciples III: Renaissance  are now fixed. Maps are loaded instantly, parties are never teleported to the city they have last visited, bottomless treasure bags with hundreds of potions inside are gone, a party can now enter the city (and not just stand next to it), game doesn't randomly crash anymore...  Playing Disciples III has finally become a pleasure.  If you had painful experience with the original game, never hesitate, get this. Troubles are gone in this edition.  If you are new to Disciples, then I'm telling you that this is a step-by-step strategy slightly influenced by RPG genre. It tells a story of several races fighting for dominance in the world of Nevendaar. Each of these races has their own goals, but their paths are constantly crossing, resulting in fierce battles. Control the resources the map has to offer, make small parties of soldiers where every fighter has their own unique skills, choose the way they will progress by means of building certain structures in your capital, and fight numerous foes to gain experience and treasures (including new weapons, armor and other stuff for your character and other party leaders). Some people say that it resembles Heroes of Might and Magic; of this, I cannot tell anything, because I never played the latter.  So, this day has come: I can now recommend Disciples III. So great to see this wonderful strategy series getting what it truly deserves.
81	0	a	Great art work, story, music! More new units in this game! Also the developers did a great job in debug! Great! but..... Hard boring and wasting a lot of time upgrading soldiers! ur soldier must reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier, before lvl 5 ur soldiers are toys! save and reload! wasting a lot of time! u cannot enjoy a smooth game play and the story! the neutral units are blocking way everywhere and u cannot even beat them because ur toy soldiers are weak!!!! also, comptuer has greater chance to cause critical hit: kill ur soldiers in mere 1 hit!!! HAX! ( such as neutral unit Male Griffin: almost 100% critical hit is that fair??) i already said ur soldiers are toys, which means greater chance to [miss]! when fighting against neutral units! this game makes me disappointed! I am huge fun of disciples! Disciples 2 is epic, but well disciples 3 Reincarnatinon ....i have to say: hehe!! when i writing this i played 10+ hrs, but i am still at the beginning of the empire quest! i feel bored. i don't want to carry on! bored to death when upgrading my toy soldiers!  well i was pretty bested by the male griffins ( neutral unit )! dat almost 100% critcal hit and kill my toys with mere 1 hit! this game is so vicious that we have to reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier! and when u made it, guess what u will find ur precious skill points of ur toy soliders disappeared without a trace! r u kiding me? what do the developers want? wasting our time?? they seems so vicious to prolong the gameplay time by making some vicious design! i was a fun of disciples! i played Disciples from 1-3! but never saw a Disciples game so vicious like this!! u k wat i feel now! bored to death when upgrading my toy soliders! toys are toys! before lv 5 ur soldiers are toys! Pls nerf Male Griffin  Also i need to chill........i must be responsible for my review so i came to edit this when i am chilled down &lt;My wish for this game&gt; I am a huge fun of Disciples from 1 to 3, just cannot stop playing it! but on behalf of all funs these years i have to say developers pls make ur game more epic,( not ....u k wat i say)! pls don't prolong gameplay by doing that! guys u must fix it! otherwise no one will carry on because u bored them to death. if u want ppl to say u game is good, at least ur game must give ppl the great passion to keep on! pls try XCOM enemy unknown(2k games) and see the difference.... (try the new DLC enemy within) and tell me which game give u a better feeling to keep on??  IF it is not the end, i think the developers are planning to make a new DLC: Return of the mountain clans!!! If not this game has not ended!
82	0	a	Well I tried to give this sorry excuse of a game another try. I purchased it when it first came out and the combat system was terrible. It takes like 10 rounds to beat goblins and imps. The enemy always has the advantage moving onto conveniently place focus points to screw you over and running like a little crap if you even get near killing one of its spell casters to another conveniently place spell power focus area. The computer will score criticals on your units and then immediately get another turn it seems due to 'good initiative.' I am sure the units get much better and each time I try to play this game it just flat out cheats. I will be a level 1 hero in the campaign and it will throw me against rogues and I have no chance of hitting them where they just take turns wasting my units.   Your hero is supposed to be the leader of these armies and to me they feel like a bunch of weaklings and it really takes away from the epic feel the game is trying to bestow. I was really hoping this would be a good patch and it started promising, but it failed again. I agree with many of the users that gave a negative review or even a posititve review, JUST PLAY DISCIPLES II IS A MUCH BETTER GAME! I don't understand how pitching six to eight units in a quick style combat is so hard for the Disciples III team to make. Start the battle and just have the units hit one another! No focus points or movement and all that crap! Make the units have significantly less HP and scale the difficulty! D+ only because the graphics and artwork are great.
83	0	a	I think the positive reviews are mostly due to extremely lowered expectations from the previous disciples iii releases. Although improved, still no comparison to the original titles. There are some good points about the game, but in general progression is extremely slow, fights are repetitive and not rewarding (in terms of XP but also artifacts are boring). There is no AI, more or less you fight only against natural groups of monsters.
2251	1	a	A very tentative recommendation. Do not play if: - You are heavily discouraged by poor unit balance - The stupid physical immunes from Disciples II were your bane - You expect the enemy AI to actually do anything on the overworld map - You expect experience proportionate to challenge - You expect the highest point in the challenge curve to be late-game rather than right at the beginning  That last point is the real issue. Early-game heroes are weak as day-old kittens - no more being the equivalent of a tier 2 from the start! - and the neutral units seem heavily biased toward a fast hero with high accuracy. Meanwhile, at the end of a campaign you'll stomp through the highest tier enemies like they weren't even there. Which is very cathartic.  All of the elements of a good Disciples game are here - the gothic setting, the glorious art, the sudden but inevitable betrayals. I'd say it's worth playing for those times when the balance sits just right.
2253	1	a	Great Game!!!  I love it! and i have it the old versions!, changed a lot od the game for good!!  Beautiful graffics and a lot of hours for fun!  the unique thing i dont like it is WHERE THE MONTAIN CLAWS??? T_T   if you like it strategy turns fights buy it and you gonna love!
84	0	a	Personally I don't like Reincarnation much since they twisted the game so much and a lot of unbalanced stuffs happened, like the Imp, I always thought that Small Imps are 'tier 1' creatures like they had always been in D2 and the last 2 D3 versions. But not anymore, they are now nightmares for your all tier 1 troop which mostly have around 8 to 12 Accuracy while those Imps have 43 Invasion (you will miss - a lot), and 140 health and 33 damage and 30 Accuracy (they do CRIT a lot, almost all the time) and 28 Initiative... basically, you just can't win against them without using some spells. And some more things I don't like to mention here as it will be too long.
2255	1	a	If you played Disciples and/or Disciples II, and did not like what Disciples III had become (Disciples III: Renaissance and/or Disciples III: Ressurection), give Reincarnation a try! Same goes for fans of HoMM series, this version of Disciples can give you a fresh experience.  This is the most recent and best developed version. Reincarnation binds all Disciples III content together (Renaissance + Ressurection), with heavily revamped maps, completely changed gameplay(Back to the old style, more like the first 2 games), and is not as unforgiving as before. (Ironically the first mission of the easiest campaign(Imperials) was the most difficult mission in the game) Maps are now a lot more open, you're no longer limited to a single path, and enemy armies twice as strong as you no longer come for you after just a few turns. If you are used to the challenge Disciples Series has given so far, I do recommend highest difficulty, as the only downside to this version is the challenge has been lowered considerably - But this is also a huge upside, as some missions and places simply were too difficult (I do enjoy a challenge, like old skool games gave, but at some point it's no longer fun to either keep restarting from scratch or act like a save junkie to abuse your way trough a single battle.)  I've spend hundreds of hours on Disciples II. Had so much fun with that. Then when Disciples III came, I never thought I'd enjoy a Disciples game again. So much had changed, for the worse. Luckily, I was not the only one who thought this way. The community worked together with the devs to bring out Disciples III: Reincarnation, the way Disciples III should have been in the first place. It's just too bad a lot of fans of the series will never even know about this. I reckon most will easily confuse this with the earlier Disciples III games, unaware the game changed so much in the meantime.
2257	1	a	A completely overhauled Disciples 3. Too bad this game wasn't launched in this final state, it would would've undoubtedly gotten a way better reception than it did. It's estethically drop dead beautiful, the mechanics are mostly sound and it's LONG.  The change from a simple Disciples 2 combat to a full-blown 3D HOMAM-style arena is controversial. In the original game the arena was way too big, the fights too long as a result and the whole game felt like a grindfest. Now the arena is significantly smaller and the fights are snappier. But a whiff of grind is still there.  An issue that bothered me more was the economy. You simply have way too much money in this game. It's not uncommon to have 30k-40k gold from mid-game which makes levelling up units trivial. You simply buy a rookie unit, go to a Training Camp, sink several grand in and voila, you got yourself an elite. It's like Diablo 3 auction house all over again. Maybe the devs wanted to make up for the fact that units level up quite slow on their own but they should've lower the XP requirements instead.  All in all though if you love D2 this version of D3 is probably gona be your cup of tea too. Definitely a very good HOMAM-like game and a very good value too.
2259	1	a	Despite all the drawbacks starting right from the beginning, the Reincarnation is a solid version of the game; I played to the very end and could enjoy it a lot. With more natural enemies, some new magic animation, graphical twitches and other new features in the game, it's only pity that due to bankruptcy the add-on with Mounting Clans was cancelled. Yes, it's not the original D1-2 style kind of game, combat particularly, probably they intended to get more HOMM-mish gameplay but still a very descent game after all. I can definitely recommend it, especially if you like this series.
2261	1	a	Amazing rebirth of one of the best RPG - Estrategy games. They impvoved a lot the graphics, incuide vegetation (also vegetation animation), water and many things more. I like the new interface too. its more intuitive and the info of the units are better explained'. I have to say that, for be playing just a cuple of hours, is much better than Renaissance and Resurrection.  The only things that i don't like is the music loop. In a battle never change, its always the same since the beginning (like a repeating track). You have the option for make it random, but its buggy.  In the other hand, all the other things are correct (or more, they fixed a lot of bugs and errors). If you like this kind of games, this is your oportunity to get it for an amazing price :)
2263	1	a	I remember the time when I play first Disciples 2. It was so awesome. After Disciples 3 came out, it was also ok for me ^^. Even if they change the combat style and other things, the story is nice.  But I got a question to Multiplayer. Because I want it to play on Net but when its looking for something, its show me error: there is no game. Will be there a patch maybe to fix it? Just asking ^^
2265	1	a	previous chapters were awesome, so i decided to buy the newly released part. I enjoyed it, as i am a fan of the line, but unfortunately this part has a number of lags and it`s not improving, the deweloper doesn`t do anything, anyway, if u are a fan as well u`ll love it
2267	1	a	All the problems that you've faced in the previous Disciples 3 editions have been pretty much sorted out. Reincarnation is the master bugfix, and adds a lot of quality of life changes to the game, such as healers in the party taking one last move at end of combat to heal up your troops before you head out, and adding a more streamlined progression system for skills and levels.  To those that have never Played a Disciples game, the soundtrack and visual style are gorgeous, and the gameplay is very enticing, with lots of options to play it straightforward, or grind for the perfect team compilation. If you want an awesome turn based strategy, you have found your mark. As a long-time fan of the Disciples series, I can finally endorse Disciples 3 with Reincarnation; it has made up for what its two previous installments lacked.
87	0	a	This game probably plays very nicely; however, there is literally no support for the game for modern computers. I am trying to run it on a high-end gaming PC (nVidia 970M, 16GB RAM, plenty of hdd and ssd space, lots of processing power, no other nonessential processes running in the background) and I can barely run this game at medium settings, which are only one step above 'low'. I tried messing with all combinations of video settings, and the game still failed. When I tried googling for documentation to troubleshoot this problem, all I found were a few words about Disciples 2 that stated that one must enable Direct3D in the graphics settings. Sadly, there is no such setting in Disciples 3.  As such, the game is essentially unplayable to anyone with a fairly new computer. I'd strongly advise against purchasing the game.
2269	1	a	When Disciples 3 first came out it was a total mess. I uninstalled it within hours.  With the suggestion of a friend I tried Reincarnation and it was suprisingly good.  It still is a very complicated and struggling experience for the beginners but it is a must for the fans of the series.  Ayrıca 'benim sadık yarim kara topraktır'
88	0	a	Not a horrible game but there are quite a few better choices out there.
2271	1	a	I love the Disciples series but initially avoided the multiple iterations Disciples 3 due to all of the negative reviews and confusion. Even after researching this particular iteration of Disciples 3, 'Reincarnation', I was skeptical but decided to buy it anyway -- and I am glad I did! This is the best version of Disciples I have ever played, an elegant blend of original Disciples dark themes, stylistic artwork and dramatic music with the more tactical 'Heroes of Might and Magic' or King's Bounty' series. If you liked either of those series or previous Disciples games you should check this one out, it is the best of all worlds.
92	0	a	It's alright I mean. The combat becomes tedious and kind of boring. Honestly might be worth a skip, the story is pretty meh too. Don't expect your leaders to do much of anything. The enemies will have 1000 hp and your leader can only hit 10-25. In 8 hours of playing I have only hit a few bugs. One made it so that I was stuck on act one for a long time. I had to keep clicking this log until a goblin came.
93	0	a	Okay, if you’re going to transform the game into Heroes Of Might and Magic, try at least not to make same mistakes. Though, Disciples is NO Heroes, it will never be Heroes nor it needs to be. The 2D and Pseudo 3D aspects of Disciples II, I loved every bit of it so F…ck very much for ruining it.  I don’t like the artwork, also the interactive objects in the game world are hardly identifiable, yes it takes some getting used to however the game lost all the Disciples appeal that attracted me in the first place.  To stupid devs - more textures and fancy 3D does not necessarily mean a better game, it’s time for you to learn that.
2273	1	a	If you like the Disciple Franchise, you will like Disciples III, sort of. I found enough changed to keep it fresh, while still keeping a lot of what made the original two great. 8/10
94	0	a	I don't really see this game as being worthy, I feel like it's just trying to be Might and Magic Heroes, if anything, get the old Might and Magic Heroes 3 on GOG.
95	0	a	Im not so sure about this game it seemed fun at first when i was playing the tutorial but the game seems so slow and bland it gets boring very fast and the spells are just stupid, seems like this game is perhaps an older and less evolved version of age of wonders which ive played the entire series of and absolutly love so when i saw this game i was exspecting something similar with its own twist but i was quite disappointed at its lack of customizabillity, options and combat expirence, i cant really recommend a game that left me feeling bored on the first level.
2275	1	a	I really do adore the disciples games but this game has issues that are very unfortunate when there is an area of the map you need to get to and just can't for some reason it's beyond annoying still a fun game
97	0	a	While I really like the game play and the fighting mechanics, It is really hard to get started in any quest. The random encounters are way to overpowered for any level 1 party to get starred I had to give up. Do not buy.
98	0	a	Well, I loved Disciples II. I played the game for countless hours. I loved the artwork, I loved the races, I loved the gameplay. It was a great, darker alternative to that other fantasy strategy/RPG game. There was just something about the game that enthralled me. I really wanted the next installment to be like the second. Unfortunately, it's not.  It looks like the AI is basically set up in such a manner that the higher the difficulty, the more your units just plain suck at combat.  First encounter into the game, my units miss more than they hit. Miss, miss, miss. That's what I saw in the first encounter. And the second. And the third.  The problem is, there's nothing I can do tactically to change this. I can jump on the focus points all I want in combat, but if my units still just whiff every time, I've got no chance. And if the enemy pounced on the focus points before I have a chance to? Well, forget it.  I've played the game for a couple of hours, and already I just plain despise it. I don't mind losing if it's because of the wrong tactical choices I've made, but when I've got no chance as a LVL 1 party because we just miss every time, forget it. I'm done.  I wanted to love this game because I adored the predecessors. This one just makes me never want to play it again.
99	0	a	Not a good game. Battle mechanic is clumsy and uncomfortable. Foes are EXTREMELY overpowerd.  Spend most of my time stuck in a small area surrounded by unbeatable foes. Same old hero's and units, very little has changed. Cannot sterss enough how stupid the battles are and it lost all it's fun. it's just isn't working!  Such a huge downgrade from Diciples 2 which I absolutely loved and played for many years! Didn't enjoy it even though I really tried (I spent 10$ on it, believe me I tried).  NOT RECOMMENDED!
2277	1	a	Disciples always keep me for hours to play all series i love them!!! 
103	0	a	Sorry no. This game just doesn't have enough gameplay to warrant even a single campaign playthrough. I guess they blew their entire budget on graphics, and forgot the important bits. I understand there are not a whole lot of games with turn based strategy, so you might be inclined to give this game a try just like me, but you'll be very disappointed with this game.
2279	1	a	THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVOURITE TBS. I WOULD SAY TO THE DEVELOPERS (WHOEVER THEY ARE OR WILL BE SINCE THIS GAME WONT BE DEVELOPED ANYMORE OF WHAT I HEARD AND READ ON THE FORUMS), PLEASE, PEASE FOR SO MANY PLAYERS SAKE @LEAST FINISH THE GAME BY ADDING THE MOUNTAIN CLANS !!!!!
2281	1	a	A very good and absorbing game. I am not sure what was wrong with the previous versions of Disciples 3, but this one is great. I am told that you have 120 hours of game play here. For the price it's a must buy.  It took me roughly a hour to get the hang of the game, but now I have a pretty good idea of what I am doing. The atmosphere and graphics are wonderful, the sound and music is good. I can't really find fault with the game.
2283	1	a	Finally, the game Disciples 3 should have been from the start. The combat is much improved and not nearly as tedious. Four different factions and a large variety of branching unit paths offers lots of replayability. I have always enjoyed the unique art style of the Disciples series and this one doesn't dissapoint. Wonderfully epic music too.
2285	1	a	in the campaigne there is abug inthe first act of the hordes campagne...got me frustrated....
2287	1	a	It's not Disciples 2, but with some mods it can get really close!
107	0	a	I love 4x games but I'd rather play HOMM 3 or 5 for the millionth time that waste my time here. I'm incredulous that this is a game that has had three expansion packs because it doesn't even have a single player mode. Yep, your options are to play the simplistic campaign or a hotseat or network multiplayer game.   I'm a gamer so I don't like when game companies go out of business but if this is representative to the games they made it is no loss they are gone.  Something I just noticed is pretty much nobody has any real hours into this game. That should speak louder than anything else.
108	0	a	Few tings WHY not to buy this game.  1. This is NOT Disciples anymore.  It's just another sh*tty Heores clone. Balance is re-done according to 'chessboard' change, and - not really recalculated properly. Now it sucks.  Where's the WHOLE F*CKING IDEA OF A CHESSBOARD WITH ONLY 6 SLOTS GODDAMIT???? The one, that was building up the whole gameplay you know, the one htat was requiring for you to calculate your army carefully, and use every single possibility to overcome your opponent? And what's with these special spots on the battlefield?  I mean, comoooooon... Shoot me at least 2 differences from heroes? Can you? Different sprites??? Or Uglier GUI??? Jeesus, Disciples was one of the BEST, and from my perspective - mainly because of this unique and interesting balance idea of a chessboard.  Now - disciples has nothing to offer except a bug reports, and ugly... graphics. And really poor storyline of course too.    2. Akella, aaaah Akella...  The WORST releaser in the world keeps up with it's own 'fame'...  I am trying to get trough first level of Demons for a f*cking week already...  Crashes ALL the time. From my previous experience of communicating with them about some crashes - it just do not work. They *usualy* just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about customer.  I really do not remember even single 'OK' release by that company, not to speak of 'Good' ones.  If only I would take care and read about that they are involved BEFORE I bought this game - I simply wouldn't. It's sooo obvious, that if the game is marked by that publisher - it just wouldn't work.
2289	1	a	This product has been released for more than 6 months via gamersgate and is a reimagining.It borrows alot from Disciples 2 and it's definately the Disciples 3 you want to own. The short vid and the game discriptions pretty much tell you of all the changes. I owned all previous version and had no hesitation buying this more complete version. It's not as easy as King's Bounty.The crucial thing in Disciples is getting a good start and looking for the easier targets early on to get you that good start.
2291	1	a	If you like the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic series, or turn-based RPG's for that matter, then I highly recommend this game. The combat is a little simplistic compared to the M&amp;M series, but it is still alot of fun.
2293	1	a	Fantastic! I was a huge fan of Disciples 2 and I'm havin' just as much fun with this.I highly recommend it if your into turn based stratagy/RPG games.
2295	1	a	I was at first not so happy about the system, but i found out that D3 reincarnation was more a mix of D3 and D2 and good stabil system, i just wish that you culd make you own groupe type, like elf ranger air - fire water, added a parth there can unlock a shoot from there give an other element dmg ½ of main to bypass magic, so you can make you own unic soldier, an other thing there whuld be nice to is to get a parth there can make the creature from 2 size to 1 size there do less hp dmg but still got the bonus as normal. the lvl should be able to get higher but give minor extra like +1dmg +2 hp, x2 for dobble size.
113	0	a	I like this game but I totally hate the orrible reduced movement range in battle and the reduced shooting range for archers and mage characters. This totally let me down, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone. Waste of money for me. This is my PERSONAL opinion.
114	0	a	Sarge, take me back to disciples II im tired of this ****
2297	1	a	this game contains Russian Inquisition - 10/10, would play again  similar games: DotA 2 (also contains Russian elements)
2299	1	a	Disicples III: Reincarnation is surely the best version of Disciples III (i mean there was 'Ressurection', that was really bugged to death and some other version if I remember correctly, that was also very buggy), not nearly as good as Disciples II, but still a good game, with a great story - and that's what I love the most about games. At least they fixed most of the bugs that I've had troubles with in earlier versions. The gameplay, on the other hand, still isn't very good, while playing a campaign the world feels too static, AI level is pretty low, you basically can predict all the moves, that AI is going to make once you've gotten deeper into the game. This game could've been a lot better, but if you are into RTS games and you are looking for something to try out, you definetly should check out this one.  7/10.  I'd still rather play Disciples II, though. :&gt;
2301	1	a	Deeper customization than Disciples 2. Cooler animations and great one-more-turn gameplay!
2303	1	a	This is what III should have been like all along. It's fantastic now and deeply enjoyable. It's a shame it took so long to get it right, I feel many people have left the franchise. It's a great game though. I adore the music, the art, the story, the battle system. The customizable leaders. They added some great stuff in here. However the AI is exceptionally bad. The version hard is essentially giving you opponents 12 levels higher. I'm not sure what goes into making AI's but both the opponents and the general monsters on a map could use a serious intelligence boost, not level boost.
2305	1	a	Playing Disciples III was a nice surprise, and I liked it a lot the fact that you have individual units instead of numbers which decrease with damage, here you can take care of them while leveling up your Hero.  I was looking for something like Heroes, since Uplay lost my key to Heroes VI,  and Ubisoft's never answered back, so...  Thumbs up for this one !!! :)
2307	1	a	Reincarnation is how Disciples III should have been in the first release. It’s the best Disciples experience so far IMHO after Disciples II, with a much better tactical system, advanced graphics, another great atmospheric soundtrack along with more detailed RPG elements on commanders. So as some others also expressed in other comments, it is truly an advanced Disciples II on every end.   It is indeed a pity the studio bankrupted and couldn’t last long enough to continue improvements over its current state. Even though most bugs are fixed, it is missing the unfinished but crucial DLC i.e. Mountain Clans which was an essential part of all previous Disciples sagas, therefore, limiting your overall experience with the game. This is the only reason why I cut off 1 point of my total score =&gt; 9/10   A true disciples fan should not miss this one in their collection. 
2309	1	a	Typical Tower Defence. There's not much I can say about this one. Good for a casual boring afternoon. I think it could be a good gift game but that about sums it up. 4.5/10
2311	1	a	Fun little tower defense game was worth the $1.24 i paid for it so it gets a good review from me.
2313	1	a	Really good &amp; fun Tower Defense game..... Enjoying my time playing this game..... Even more addicted than GTA V for sure.  It's been a while since i played this game, recently i just started to play it again and now i remembered why i stopped played it before... how time flies away while play this game.... so much fun to plan your tactics to encounter the incoming enemies.   You got to have strategies to deploy your arsenal under budget given at the start of the round, you received money after killing enemy which you can use to buy more arsenal to play with. Every mission contains about 20 or more rounds and every campaign contains multiple missions.
2315	1	a	Really hard tower defense game.  Has two main campaigns, the first is of which is easy enough but the second gets a bit harder. Also 'Quickplay' levels which are the same as in the campaign but with more limits on what turrets and upgrades are available.  It's very easy to pick up and learn, and smashing through the campaigns even on hardest difficulty is not terribly hard if you've played any tower defense games before, but the Quickplay missions for the second camapaign get diabolical, so good luck getting the associated achievements! Nice simple visuals, sound can get a bit annoying because certain things (explosions) are repeated a lot.  Overall it's good for a playthrough, and if you're into TD at all then make sure to play this.
2317	1	a	A pretty plain tower defense that's better suited for maybe a tablet. Still, surprisingly difficult.  6/10  It took me 2.5 years to beat two missions.
2319	1	a	 A 'rough gem'.
2321	1	a	iBomber Defense is about what you'd expect from a WWII themed tower defense game. Basic MG, Artillery, and AA emplacments are each designed to counter the stadard threats by land, air or sea. The maps can be challenging, particularly in areas where terrain prevents placement along likely paths, unfortunately, this isn't always obvious as occasionally open spaces will not allow placement. The campain mode is unfortunately linear, however, there will occasionally be 'defense' bonus levels, where you get to play a previous map with already placed towers and a nice purse to upgrade and expand from the get go. Although you'll be trying to defend against a more challenging string of attackers, extra 'action' points (for upgrading and expanding available defense options) will be easier come by  All in all, an easy game to pick up and put down whenever you get bored. It doesn't really stack up to some of the more dynamic tower defense games, but it gets the job done.
2323	1	a	I don't know why but I love this game. When I don't feel like thinking much I load this up and play for a bit. Its a pretty generic tower defense game. I think I got it for $5 which I'd say its worth that, any more than that is pushing it.
2325	1	a	Pretty good TD game
2327	1	a	Great little tower defense game. But there are equal alternatives that you can play for free. If it's on sale you can't do anything wrong buying it.
2329	1	a	Ratings: 7.1/10  The game is fair enough to play. Unlike any other tower defense game. Just have built-in aspects of its' own and creativity. Not much to say as I would sometimes play when I have the time. Worth playing if you like tower defenses games, but this is the average.
2331	1	a	nice tower defense - where's my touchscreen? td on mouse is so oldskool
135	0	a	I enjoy Tower Defense titles.  I did not enjoy this one  2/10
136	0	a	I don't even know when I got this game.
2333	1	a	As everything else has already been said before, only one word from me to describe this game:  B-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-M ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  (And as 'Firepower' *hinthint* does still matter: ... Remember to turn the volume UP! ... :)
2335	1	a	I like this game. Gave me a good 'coffee and wakeup-game' experience. A few missions are damn hard, but not too hard, just like a good Tower game should be. I just wish there was more missions. I'd love some DLC here. Cheap and good, go for it.
2337	1	a	Alright 'Tower defense' game 7/10
2339	1	a	This game is very addictive. Maybe its the sound effects, maybe its the blowing up of stuff, i dunno but its definitely fun :-)
2341	1	a	A good, neat and well presented little TD that has a nice, logical and familiar control layout (reminds me of Gemcraft to some degree). ****
2343	1	a	if you are a tower defense buff then this is a great game to add to the collection requires patience like any tower defense but still an overall joyous experience
2345	1	a	iBomber Defense is one of the funnest tower defense games I have played in a long time. Especially because it is based on WWII. Also, the game developers are badass and didn't mind putting swastikas as well as iron crosses on Nazi jeeps, tanks, and other forces. A great game especially for the price. I'd have paid twice as much. By the way there is a sequel of sorts called iBomber Defense Pacific, which as you may have guessed is against the Japanese mainly from islands and mainlands shooting at boats and the occasional air raid. I have both but this one is my favorite. Fighting in the forests of German, and eventually Berlin is indescribable in how fun it is.
141	0	a	I got this game and it gave my computer some kind of major error. So be careful if you get this game.
2347	1	a	Great game. I've been playing these games on iOS for a long time asnd the deskyop version is judt as much, and just as challenging as you want it to be.
2349	1	a	This is a standard tower defense game, reasonably well done - you have the standard decisions to make of which type of turret to place and where to place it stop the waves of enemies making it to your base. As you kill enemies you earn money to either build more defenses, or in later levels to upgrade existing turrets to do more damage and/or increase their range (if you have unlocked the higher levels of that turret type).  The weapons are fairly well spread with clear differences and advantages which are fairly intuitive/sensible - machine guns fire fast but low damage and short range, artillery is slower but harder hitting and with bigger range, AA guns can only affect planes, etc. Equally the enemies have a decent variation - easy stuff for the beginning, then you will usually get mixtures of fast low armour units, slowish moving tanks, and so on, so you can't just build one type of turret and leave it at that, usually every wave you are having to react off what is coming and beef up the turrets of the appropriate type or add new ones to deal with the every increase numbers, speed or toughness of the units charging at you. Oh and then a wave of bombers comes onto the screen and you suddenly need to place down a couple of AA guns near your base, etc.  There is certainly nothing special or innovative here, but it is a solid tower defense game that is pretty well balanced, and could act as a good starting point to learn the basics of the genre, or just a more casual atmosphere and challenge than some of the more in depth/complex or genre blurred variations on this theme (Tower Wars or Defense Grid or Sanctum or Defender's Quest etc)
144	0	a	I love every kind of Tower Defense games and I would probably love iBomber Defense IF... yes, there are many bad things. Starts very slow, every each of level is slow and that goes from beggining to very end of game. Not many different enemies, those are same in every level. You can't switch to other window while playing because the game will be paused - WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN DEFENSE TOWER GAME WHERE EACH OF WAVE IS GOING VERY SLOW AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MOVE IT FASTER - EVEN ON HIGHEST SPEED IT EVERYTHING MOVES LIKE TURTLE. Level desing is also rather poor and graphics aren't 'fantastic', like Steam store page is saying. I don't mind that i's iOS/Android port, there are game which can be also good. Too bad there are almost no devs which would care about making it more enjoyable on PC. I had trouble enjoying it thought first campaing. The rest was just a hell which has finally ended...
2351	1	a	A really fun and simple tower defense game. Looks quite nice too and has some fun maps. Quite cheap and provides some good fun and challenges.
2353	1	a	One of the best Tower Defense games I ever played..
2355	1	a	A good, if dull, tower defense game. Doesn't really have it's own style, which is where Plants vs Zombies really thrived, and even Defense Grid had a bit with the robot narator, but nothing here. Regardless, good TD game that is only $5, and I have not completed both campaigns yet and have logged on 8+ hours so far. Seems like a good rate to me.
2357	1	a	I got this on sale for 60% Off. This is a really fun game to un-wind with; casual, easy, fun and addictive. There are plenty of Steam achievements to make it more interesting too, but no trading cards. Check a youtube video to get a feel for gameplay dynamics. Kick back and mow-down the incoming mechanized infantry and armor when you need to take a break from your favorite RPG first-person-shooter.
2359	1	a	The game is a tower defense game. Is it worth $10 maybe not for something you can play on a Browser for free. If you can get this game for $5 or under. I think its worth the game time. Its fun and I enjoy playing this.
2361	1	a	Very good tower defence game and a cheap one too =)
2363	1	a	Cool, simple tower defender. Limited in scope, but not bad for $5.
2365	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2367	1	a	An ok TD for a ok price. Bog standard TD where enemies go on a set path (no mazing) and just build/upgrade towers. Decent amount of missions and can be quite challenging.
2369	1	a	It's oke, i r&amp; 8/8 pls no h&amp; i'll open the g&amp; for my m&amp;
2371	1	a	It's super funny to play this!
2373	1	a	This game is well worth the £3.00
148	0	a	A lazy port from a tablet game. The different levels have random difficulty and there's nothing really unforgettable or just cool in this very classical tower defense.
2375	1	a	70/100  Good military TD with Support buildings and a 1-time REPLAY button for the round ;D Long Missions and good Campaign (WorldWar2), but 1 mistake can cost you half the game ;)  Worth the money, but needs some finetuning to become a classic!
150	0	a	Very Very bad sound quality on towers. very short on towers, you can choose from 5 difrent only. ive seen free to play tower defence waaaay better than this. dont buy this....
2377	1	a	Addictive and deceptively tough little Tower Defence game. One of the top 3 TD games I've played. Well worth the price.
151	0	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is a game developed by the lone indie developer Jason Rohrer. Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game.   Insidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.  As a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music.   There are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.  Score: 3.5/10
152	0	a	Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game. This is an unfinished program with no vision. Your only purpose is to pilot around from randomly generated level to randomly generated level finding better upgrades so that you can kill the enemies in the way more easily.
153	0	a	Interesting concept and gameplay but nothing there to make you want to continue playing after an hour.
2379	1	a	If you enjoy the concept of games as art than this could be for you. I find it to be one of those games I can get lost in for a few 15 minute sessions here and there. There are some points where it's either over the top difficult or because of the power ups you've achieved it's too easy but those moments in between are great fun.
154	0	a	If I was given a chance to refund a single game, it would be this.   There is an interesting mechanic (diving into enemies, power-ups etc.) but its connection to the game is vague at best. Going into something feels nothing more than a “next level button , thus making it easier to lose track of your progress, everything looks so similar, if not identical.
155	0	a	This game has a super-interesting high concept to it. However, without any defined goal, it's ultimately pointless. There is no end-game. Have fun playing forever, or, more likely, stop after an hour or so and never pick it up again. This is Jason Rohrer at his Rohreriest.
2381	1	a	Interesting concept where you dive inner(or outer) from yourself, an enemy or power up in order to make the subject in question weaker, stronger or different in order to get to the 'next level'.  Once you figure out the concept of the game... well, that's pretty much it. There is no story so going through each 'level' is pretty much like playing in an arcade, where you are just going for the points. That's not a bad thing, but for me, I wish there was more.  I still recommend the game due to the fact that it has a VERY unique gameplay system. If anything, this game is still worth the trip, even if it is just for a little while!
2383	1	a	A very wierd but fun game that makes me think of Gauntlet for some reason  Video Review Below:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269705143 
2385	1	a	This game is unmistakably a return to a time when video games were more raw, unfinished, and simple. That this game appears to have depth and complexity is itself an illusion. I can count on my fingers the number of new things you will encounter as you play through the levels. My first time, I went as low as level -40. I couldn't seem to figure it out and every time you die, you go down a level. But then I started over, and am currently stuck at around level 118. There is a room full of robots that shoot enough bullets to make a japanese top-down shooter choke, and so to get past it, I went 'inside' one of the enemies to try and disable it's weapons through giving it weaker powerups. Instead, now I am trapped inside of it by more crazy robots.  The way I got as far as I have was not actually through a whole lot of careful planning or picking the right items. Instead, I find that I progressed faster by running straight past or through things to the exit. Since when you die you automatically get one of your three 'power ups' replaced with about 6 life points, you can burn through those and get to the exit. But, having done this, I am now not strong enough to proceed.
2387	1	a	Surprisingly deep. Literally.
2389	1	a	Inception:The Game
160	0	a	I get it, small, compact, limitless, indie. But it doesn't make it fun or especially intereseting I'm afraid.
2391	1	a	This is a game about getting lost in infinity. It will be one of the scary and serious experiences you can have in your life.
2393	1	a	A bit boring &amp; a bit pointless. Sorry, infinite shooter of critical acclaim ;)
2395	1	a	I truely can't understand how I'm so addicted to this...
161	0	a	'What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?' is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.  Honestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an 'infinite, recursive, tactical shooter'. By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.  The artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews. I hope.
162	0	a	I don't get this game... seriously. Why isn't there a proper tutorial ? I get the idea of moving to higher levels, and the fact that the higher you get the more enemies appear. But what do the power-ups mean ? How do I change weapons ? Can I even change weapons ? What's the best tactic ? How do I change an enemy from the inside ? And so on and so forth. This would've been a better game if things like that were explained properly. Also, the stylish retro graphics do make up for some of the game, but it just isn't enough. Let's hope the developer fixes some of my complaints in the near future.  [Rating: 66/100]
163	0	a	This game has literally no point. No plot. Just the mechanic of shrinking into objects, with no real end to how small you can possibly get. And while that in itself is an awesome mechanic... it is rendered meaningless because there's just no plot. There's nothin'. It's literally just you going around shooting stuff and getting smaller.
164	0	a	I did not enjoy this game at all.
2397	1	a	'we need to go deeper!'  An infinitely procedurally generated word. Infinite in the scope of a human lifetime.  Go into enemies to make them weaker, go into power ups to make them stronger.   Like 'Inception', except, it NEVER ends.   Insanely difficult, and hard to manage where you are. Very interesting, and majorly rewarding when you finally get to a place and plant your flag in a place NO HUMAN has ever been.  7.5/10 Try, a must if you like shooters or very interesting indies.
2399	1	a	there are no skies in this game
166	0	a	Of all the hipster indie trash I've played, this is by far the most pretentious and pointless.
167	0	a	I have no idea what the point of this game is about. no story, it's only a design idea.
168	0	a	Pointless.
2401	1	a	Yo Dawg! We heard you like shmups, so we put a shmup inside your shmup, so you can shmup while you shmup!
2403	1	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is by far one of the most curious games I have played in a long time. Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical. I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.
2405	1	a	This is the soul of video games right here: one man doing all the artwork, music, and programming for a game. It's how the industry began! The result in this case is something more unique than most corporate-funded teams would ever think of, much less dare to release.  Ever seen the movie 'Existenz'? Don't. It's silly. See 'The Thirteenth Floor' instead. It's way better. Anyway, both movies tackle the idea of recursive realities. Inside a Star-Filled Sky puts CONTROL of that concept at the core of a gaming experience. That enemy's too tough? Enter him, dumb-down his abilities, exit, then waste him with ease. Alternatively, enter yourself, learn Kung Fu, exit, then waste him with ease.  Jason Rohrer has made a game that's thought-provoking, moderately mind-bending ('What was I trying to do again? And which level of reality IS this?!'), a good bit of pixelphilic fun, and simply worth your money. If nothing else, I admire his proper use of hyphenation. Support literate games!
2407	1	a	This is a fun little game to just relax with for a while. Not much meat on the bones, but worth it over time
2409	1	a	I wouldn't call this game a hard tactical shmup as it's on the level of an easier Realm of a Mad God. Anything can become the stage as you can enter another level by hopping into the up arrow tile/manually enter a powerup on the ground/enter enemies or hell even your ownself. A good game to pass the time but I wouldn't call it a difficult shmup.
2411	1	a	Indie game of the year for me. And, yes. I have played Bastion.
2413	1	a	The reviews come close to showing what this game is about, but it can't show you just how good it is because what you'll see will be different than what anyone else sees. The strategies that you will come up with will be different. It's because your arenas will be different, your power up options will be different, and your enemies will be different. This is a different kind of game.  There are only two things about this game that some people may not like. The graphics are blocky and there is no goal other than the level you reach.  If you love a challenge, and enjoy slick game design, you should play this.

2417	1	a	You enter enemies to weaken them, powerups to improve them, yourself to fix your combos... recursively!
2419	1	a	WHAT IF YOU COULD PLAY A GAME INSIDE AN POWERUP INSIDE A GAME INSIDE AN ENEMY INSIDE THE WALL INSIDE AN ENEMY.
2421	1	a	Have you ever wanted a fresh cup of tea made with the freshest and finest of Indian tea?  Maybe you wish to invade India and create an empire of tea and corruption? Maybe you just hate the French with such an unreasonable passion that you want to invade them for nothing? Or becuase they are French? Have you ever hated freedoms and liberties?  Maybe you just want to crush the American Revolution and Tax the ♥♥♥♥ out of them for high quality tea? Ever wanted to sink a Spanish Armada just becuase its too Catholic for its own good? Or maybe, just maybe you want to demonstrate the beauty of gunpowder to the savages of the Americas? Maybe you want to murder a people in order to force them to grow you opium? Maybe you want to murder a people in order to force them to buy said opium? Either way the Chinese and Indians won't mind another Opium War...  At the end of the day, if you are a war mongering, tea drinking, bayonet using, people oppressing, gentleman of Her Majesty's finest of British Empires then this is probably a good game for you...  And if you like RTS's then this is a good choice... Worth every penny... every penny you made selling opium you sold to the Chinese...
2423	1	a	For me still one of the best TW games ... after the 'desease' at release with a bunch of patches solved most problems of the game during the following months. This was a hard time for many hardcore TW fans and many were really annoyed with it or still are. This is understand able, because many of the bugs were silly at least, as well some of the patches made things worse but did not improve problems. So players become feeling to be the beta testing object for CA for a still bought, but very bugged game and this is not acceptable. Empire is now running very good, but in combination with Darth Mod which improves the game to a status, which normally should be delivered by Creative Assembly itself in my opinion. I don't know in detail how Darth and his modding team did improve, but the result is only great. For example, the AI was really improved - not that AI becomes a smart enemy in campaign, but the acting was put by Darth into good rails of logical issue. Some things were improved by simple overwriting, for example the masses of merchant ships build by AI insteed war ships with the simple solution to let recruit smaller war ships (up to 4th class) in merchant ports too. I played Napoleon very often too and some of the the improvements here are missing in Empire. Napoleon itself is very interesting too, but for me too local and too small as campaign map.  To be honest, the following Shogun TW and RTW-2 brought further, very good improvements in game, but these games did not convince me to play further. RTW-2 has for me a very bad graphic and game hub design which did me more annoy as giving fun.  In conclusion, Empire is still my favorite TW game and still makes fun after nearly 3,500 hours game time!
2425	1	a	The only game where you can invade Russia , in the winter.
2427	1	a	Years later, most issues are fixed and there is a host of mods to make the experience even better. This is a must have!
2429	1	a	Used American Indians to conquer India: 10/10
2431	1	a	Started an Austrian campaign with the intentions of using their light infantry to skirmish my way to to an Austrian empire in western Europe.  Despite my best intentions of leaving the mighty Ottoman empire alone I was eventually drawn into a war with them while my armies were busy in France.   I got steamrolled pretty badly and it was clear that I couldn't hold out on two fronts.  Taking inspiration from another famous Austrian I decided to Boys From Brazil the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Fully half of my forces were left to turtle up around my strongest city, defending a bunker as it were, and hold out as long as possible before the inevitable. The rest were piled into what naval strength I had and sailed for the New World.   Several turns later they arrived and took over a South American province just before my last one in mainland Europe fell (thus knocking me out of the game) and the rest of the South American provinces fell shortly afterwards.   Eventually the Austrian Empire Reborn was able to conquer most of the Americas and return to Europe to dish out some extremely righteous vengeance.  10/10, would proto-Hitler again.
2433	1	a	The Ottomans tried to overwhelm my army of regulars with a few farmers wielding pitchforks. We almost lost.  10/10.
2435	1	a	If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.
2437	1	a	Empire: Total War takes place during the 18th century; The schizophrenic age of absolute monarchies, imperial colonialism, the enlightenment, and the beginnings of globalism &amp; industrialism. This particular TW has set its name apart from all the others in the series for a few specific reasons. Being the fifth title in the series and the first Total War game to solely focus on guns &amp; artillery, it had big expectations. However, upon it's release it generally got mixed reception. Many people criticized it negatively, but I believe it to be one of the better Total War games.   Pros:  -  Three separate theatres of war   The Americas, Europe, India, and four theatres of trade.  -  11 Major Nations  to choose from.   (All factions playable with mods)  -  The Road to Independence Campaign   Separated into four parts, this game mode acts as a tutorial as a general campaign. You found the Jamestown/Virginia colony and expand, fight in the French-Indian Wars alongside Britiain as the 13 Colonies, rebel and fight the British at Bunker Hill, and finally form The United States.  - Amazing  Land and Sea battles .   Fight Land, Siege, and Naval battles. ETW introduced naval battles with the historical, monsterous Ships of the Line.  -  100 years to play (1700-1800)    2 turns per year. 100 years. 200 turns   - Great  Historical Battles  - A  Vast technology tree  parted into thirds.  Enlightenment, Economics, and Military  -  Religion is a major factor for the last time in a Total War series .  [/i]Choose your state and spread their religion to conquered lands.[/i] -  Revolutions!    One of the best features in the game and certainly the most notable. Choose from 3 kinds of government; Absolute Monarchy, Constitutional Monarchy, or dare you be...a Republic? This was the age of many revolutions, and as such, you'll choose whether to uphold the status quo and put down rebellions or begin a revolution against your own nation.  -  Multiplayer   Land, Naval, or Siege battles.   -----------   Cons:  - The AI[/b] as in many TW games, is not all that great. - Minor bugs &amp; glitches. - Unfair rep in the TW family.   DLC
2439	1	a	Fire by rank is one of the most satisfying things you can possibly experience.
2441	1	a	The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started.Empire: Total War is a masterful combination of all the things that I love about strategy games -- a great setting, a first-rate presentation, tactics that reward maneuver, and a strategic layer that requires flexibility in your plans...Simply put, if you're a fan of strategy games, this is one game you must have in your collection.Empire: Total War is breathtaking in its scope, enthralling in its detail, and staggering in its execution. Despite one or two minor flaws, it should be considered one of the very best strategy titles available on any platform.Looking for errors in this game is pretty hard, but the sluggish controls and small AI quirks prevent Empire: Total War from scoring perfect. Still, it’s a feast for every strategist.This is one of the most sophisticated, entertaining, and historically accurate strategy games ever made.
2443	1	a	This game is wonderful if your goal is to crush the American Revolution and see to it that Britain is the world super power forever. ALL HAIL GREAT BRITAIN.   10/10 would drink tea again.
2445	1	a	- Play as the mighty dutch - Trade Ceylon for Flanders - Realize my mistake - Take over the pirates - Build Caribbean empire and large navy  - Take over all trade theaters - Be super rich - Buy more ships - Realize it's 1799 and I haven't conquered a single European province - Prussia owns all of Europe - 10/10 would get super rich again
2447	1	a	Personally, i throughly enjoy this game. It has a greatly expanded campaign map, tons of factions, and a much better diplomacy interface. On the downside, the AI is rather difficult, and often borders on(and crosses into...) being incredibly dumb. Battle mechanics are great, with better UI, better graphics, and expanded options. I like the 'take cover' selection that allows units to hide in buildings, or next to fences. They handled the change from melee-based combat, with little 'ranged combat', to a system with very nearly soley 'ranged' combat mecanics very, very well. The addition of Naval Battles is an extrordinary change, as all previous games had the 'autobattle' for sea combat(or in the case of med 1, random battles popping up as 'events' against the primarily land-based campaign), and i throughly enjoyed learning how to command such a sea battle. If you're looking for a TW game, or even just a nice game to play, and one that will not be a 'short play-through', then i heartfully recomend ETW.  10/10 for me.
2449	1	a	&gt;Becomes the Germans (Prussia) &gt;Invades Poland &gt;Austria declares war &gt;mfw I own Austria &gt;Every single main Europeon nation declares war &gt;mfw I own Europe  10/10 would invade Poland again
2451	1	a	Easily one of the best war games I've ever played, set in a fascinating period of history with an extensive map stretching over North America, Europe, the Middle East and India which you can conquer and I was glued to the screen for nearly 80 hours. One of the best PC games I've played to this day.
2453	1	a	Marched my strongest men to the enemy walls, started to climb, all my men fall and die 10/10
2455	1	a	&gt;Prussia conquered Europe  &gt;I was a king of Prussia &gt;I was a tyrant &gt;People wanted democracy &gt;I sparked a revolution  &gt;I sided with rebels &gt;I overthrew my ex-government &gt;Now I'm a dictator &gt;Now Prussia has true 'DEMOCRACY'.   11/10 would democratize again
2457	1	a	Played as Britain and slaughtered every American Tribe  10/10 Would genocide again
2459	1	a	I have never been disappointed by any of the total war series. Empire is certainly one of the best. The land battles, and the sea battles are epic. Diplomacy can be a bit difficult, and empire management takes more time as you progress, but it is all worth it in the end. Do yourself a favor, and get familiar with this one. I would give it a very high score.
2461	1	a	Very good game.  -Extremely historically accurate -Best campiagn (in my opinion) of the TW series -Very cool and realistic battles -Very fun  A really cool game for all strategy game lovers or historians. Even if this game doesn't necesarilly appeal to you, check out the other TW games, they are all great fun.
2463	1	a	-Start as Prussia -Build an Army -Build one brig -Transport army of over 1000 to america on brig -Kill native -Now true European -Force natives into army -Force natives to fight in India 10/10 Would force Indians to fight Indians again
2465	1	a	First, I need to say I am a fan of history. I love history. I also enjoy video games. So when these two things are combined, they make something awesome. This game is amazing! The graphics are a little dated but still are pleasible. Other than that I have no complaints. If you enjoy history, get this game. Trust me.
169	0	a	This game can be a lot of fun, but there are so many little annoyances that all add up to create an insanely frustrating experience in the vanilla version of the game (if you want to avoid half of the mess, download Darthmod to fix many of the bugs that Creative Assembly has kindly left in the game). This game has been patched more than my old pair of highschool jeans, and yet, diplomacy and declarations of war are still seemingly decided by the toss of a coin, rather than the global situation. Increasing the difficulty level doesn't even make things more demanding on the battlefield (The AI has the mental ability of a toddler, even on the very hard setting) but on the campaign map, someone decided that making the game 'challenging' on higher difficulties involves every nation declaring war on you at the same time very early on for no reason. Difficutly should be based around the player's skill level and their ability to complete REALISTIC objectives - Having every nation jump on you like the crabs of a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, does not meet this criteria. Furthermore, the only way I'm able to reliably establish trade with other nations is for me to offer the technological equivilent of a thermonuclear weapon, in exchange for the ♥♥♥♥ing wheel. If you're patient, and you enjoy 18th century history and warfare like I do, then please play this game with mods enabled to avoid a headache. Otherwise, play Shogun 2, or any of the previous Total War games as they are far superior to this game.
2467	1	a	I'm a big fan of all the Total War games! No other grand strategy war games takes on whole eras of combat with such a combination of respect and fetishism for the rules and wisdom of battle, and no series treats history like such a serious playground of possibilities. If you have the time and the dedication, all the Total War games will shower you with gaming glory and riches, Empire is no exception.  And as a personal bonus for me, this game mentions my ancestors (which are very rarely mentioned in video games), the Kalmyks!  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590501874   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590458520   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723801740 
2469	1	a	After 100+ hours I have to say for anyone wanting a good strategy game it's well worth * what are they listing it for now * the price.  Pro's -Combat requires some strategy you dont just auto win. -Long campaign   Con's  My navy ships never really worked the way I wanted
2471	1	a	The mist has rolled in over the atlantic, covering my British line infantry from providing support to america as the French grow in number. But out of this mist comes a sail, not one sail, but 11 more. Those ships a all have two decks lined with 15 guns. How can my lightly armed crew withstand such assualt. There's no hope in running, my ships are to slow. What to do? I've got it. But I've only got four ships! Do it anyway I line two of my vessels horizontally so that the guns are aiming straight at the enemy, slowly aproaching with all 11 of their battleships. My other two vessels get ready to swing around the line of ships I set, just waiting. They're close enough. FIRE Ship plows through FIRE Ship plows through FIRE Ship plows through FIRE Ship decides to retreat. It's to damaged to return, but the other 10 begin to turn their hulls so that the can fire.  Perfect! They've sailed close enough. I bring my ships out from behind under the cover of cannon shells. The easily flank the ships, as they are smaller, the manueverablility is much higher. The cannons tear through 2 ships hulls as they sink to the ground. While there is still chaos of a split force, I bring my two ships up in a frontal assauslt. If you can imagine, I have two ships plowing into the enemy line, while the other two have flanked them and make sure they can't flank. I end up winning with one ship lost and the other three having severe damage. The enemy's lost all of their ships. My ships reach america with the supplies. 9 / 10 would rek again.
2473	1	a	I played it a little bit, it was ok.
2475	1	a	I would def recommend this game! One of my favorites of all the Total War strategy games.  1. Huge map encomapssing the whole world 2. quite a large variety of nations and units 3. easily 400-500 hours of gameplay 4. Favorite of all the total war games so far.
2477	1	a	Total War Empire  This is a really good Total War game. It is more up to date than Medieval II (good game) and playes much better than Napoleon or Shogun II. Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)  You get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy.   The units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.  Generals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.  Trading is neat. Diplomacy works well too.  Ship battles are cool.  Anyway, this is a good Total War title. I had no problems getting the game to run in Win 7 64-bit. Good game.
2479	1	a	Play as glorious Holland Take all Western Europe and then all of India 10/10 would VOC again
2481	1	a	The United Provinces is flourishing. They have now conquered Morocco, and have deimated the Nation of France. All of the Island territories belonging to the French and Pirates are now under their control.  The Nordic nations have now bent the knee, with Denmark being forced to retreat to Iceland, remaining as Protectorate.  The Indian theater of war has seen bloody battles for the United Provinces. The people of Meysore have fallen, and the Marathan Confederacy are decimated. The Mughal Empire is weary, and demands a peace, to which I must agree.   Then, as nobody had expected, THE SPANISH INQUISITION. Like a swift manouver, suddenly the province of France is obtained. Morocco falls, and then the American territories fall. One by one, the Spanish Inquisition takes the United Provinces by storm. Soon, Russia invaded me in the winter. The Scandanavian countries fall, the Prussians get in on the action, and take Copenhagen.  Watching from my Palace, I see the Empire crumble. Soon the valiant men of Amsterdam must defend against the coalition. Russians, Prussians and Spanish have all joined to defeat this once proud nation. The brave men of Amsterdam try, but fail. I have been defeated. I then proceed to walk away from my computer, stand in my shower, and cry in the cold, icy water.
2483	1	a	Darth-mod highly recommended, otherwise AI is outright terrible. Despite the AI flaws, it's a very good strategy game.
2485	1	a	I don't understand all the hate for this particular title. Probably my favourite TW game.
2487	1	a	Love the era this is set in, thoroughly enjoyed conquering the new world. Had a troubled launch, but that was years ago, the game as it is now is a must for RTS fans.
2489	1	a	Excellent and wonderful game. Not my first Total War, but by and by my favourite. Easy enough for casual players to pick up but offers a great depth of play for veterans of RTS and TBS games, whether you're into commanding an army in the battlefield, or if you're more into the politics of war.
2491	1	a	I've played Total War since Medieval II and ever since, this has been one of the finest. If you have been looking for a game that deals with the age of gunpowder and the political and diplomatic instability of the 1700s, look no further. Although more recent Total War games now have access to the Steam Workshop, Empire still has some amazing modders out there. This review is kinda short but lol okay... 8.5/10... Kinda buggy though at times
2493	1	a	'Your general is dead' k rip thx  Oh yes, oh yes. Now for my pros and cons list Pros: Lots of Units Lots of Countries Lots of Annexing Lots of Capturing Lots of British Lots of India Lots of Trade Lots of Negotiating Lots of Generals Lots of Boats Lots of Horses Lots of cannons  Cons: A lot of the countries, when trying to negotiate with them, are either big jerks or ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. Ex:  Me Offers: All Tech 5000 Dollars 4 Regions Indefinite Military Access Access to Trade Routes Demands: Military Access: 5 turns  NPCs: No 
2495	1	a	The Second-Best Strategy game that I have played! Empire: Total war let you go into the past time and control armies. That include the French, the Indians, America, and English Red Coat army! The graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is smooth, no errors !The game is totally epic! I reccomend playing this ultra awesome game.
2497	1	a	 Empire: Total War™
2499	1	a	Awesome Game! Just Wish they'd hurry up and make Total War: Civil War!!!
2501	1	a	It's been a while since my first review of this game, so I felt it would be time to give out a more proper one. It's a good game, but not without several problems.  Empire: Total War, set in the 18th century, is a game I reccomend to the player who likes the idea of massive, 18th century-style land and naval battles. The game also has a very large campaign map, including India, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. There's also a lot of colonialism involved as well, so if you like all of these things I mentioned, you'll probably like this game.   However, don't expect multiplayer to be a fun experience. It's still active, but there aren't many people playing. There's a good number of players here that will mistakenly or purposefully break the rules set by players hosting their games. Even hosts will break their own rules.   You also need to consider the fact that there are many players on here that have adopted the use of specific units that are simply OP, which therefore ruins the historical atmosphere of this game. Historically, most 18th century infantry were armed with highly innacurate guns, so they gathered in very large formations and fired at each other. They were called line infantry. This type of warfare was in no way meant to prolong the life of an individual soldier at all. The entire point of this type of fighting between infantry units was to use overwhelming force and numbers of troops and firepower to overcome the other side, which meant that line infantry would have to have some serious discipline and toughness. You'd rarely ever take cover, and if you were in the front lines, your slim chances of surviving the battle depended on how fast you could reload your gun and if you could make your shot count before the other side did the same thing you were meant to do.   Now, you'd think line infantry would be the staple unit on this game, and therefore they'd be pretty effective. However, their historical use as the essential staple unit for 18th century armies can easily be rendered useless on this game with just three types of units: Riflemen, skirmishers, and light dragoons.   The sad fact is that on multiplayer, the only three types of effective ground units that have any form of effectiveness on this game are the three units I stated above, aside from artillery. True, line infantry still have their uses, but not by much You see, the problem here is that skirmishers and riflemen have guns that can shoot farther than the muskets used by your line infantry, and they are unfairly accurate, meaning that your line infantry will be dropping like flies just trying to close the distance to take on the skirmishers and riflemen. They also reload their weapons incredibly fast. This is in no way historically accurate, because the guns used by lighter infantry forces at the time, no matter how far they shot, were still incredibly accurate and would have taken a long time to reload. Not only that, but we're talking about guns that weren't easy to aim with.   I could understand how lightly armed riflemen and skirmishers could give line infantry some serious trouble in, say, a bunch of forests, but they are so overpowered on this game that they can easily take out line infantry on an open battlefield.   Then there are light dragoons...  Light dragoons are soldiers riding on horseback, equipped with modified muskets that have shorter barrels. Therefore, they'd be less accurate, right? In real life, yes, but in this game? Wrong. Would it be easy reloading these guns on horseback? No, because muskets need to have the projectiles loaded with ram rods, primed, blah blah blah, shoot, repeat. It's difficult enough to do all of this while standing on your own two feet, but on horseback? That's bound to take longer.   Light dragoons can be incredibly dangerous to line infantry due to their superior speed, and because this game has overpowered them, every single soldier in a unit of light dragoons fires his gun, even the ones in the back. None of the troops in the front ranks of the dragoons die, and for some strange reason, a good number of the shots fired hit their mark. Sometimes, This means that you'll be having large numbers of line infantry dying all at once, which can cause a morale shock.   So unless you make rules against the use of light dragoons and skirmishers on the games you host in multiplayer, you'll be seeing these units being used on a constant basis, throwing all of the great historical accuracies of 18th century warfare out the window.  Now that's been explained, I should tell you about a few problems with other aspects of this game:  1) Despite the fact that Empire has a very large campaign map, you will be disappointed to find that almost every single battle map looks the same. Same texture, same everything. Yes, some buildings will look different depending on what part of the world you're in on the campaign, but you will quickly realise how bland the atmosphere of the maps are when you fight battles. Building detail in towns is also severly lacking.  2) The AI is incredibly dumb at times, so dumb that the developers decided to buff up the stats of the AI's units to compensate for their stupidity in the higher difficulty levels.   3) Individual troops in your army lack spatial awareness when they enter buildings or defend/attack fort walls in a siege battle. It's a horrid sight to see at times. Troops just move through each other in a frantic motion. Path finding on walls is also terrible.  4) Some sound effects for this game are awful, especially for muskets. For example, when a unit of line infantry fire a volley at the enemy, you only hear a 'poof' sound. These are primitive gunpowder weapons. They should be noisy and make a loud 'bang' when fired. Instead, the muskets used by your line infantry sound like fake guns used for movies in Hollywood.  5) You won't hear any general's speech before battle like you used to in Rome I and Medieval II.   6) There isn't much voice acting. You won't get to hear any voice acting at all when you initiate diplomacy, and the few bits of voice acting that you do here on this game tends to be subpar.  7) Melee combat between infantry units looks decent, but not amazing. The combat animations are too drawn out and look more rehearsed than realistic. Some of the combat animations are so terrible drawn out that everything looks unrealistic.  8) Because of the way the death animations work on this game, cavalry takes forever to take out a routing unit. Many times, an unnecessarily long combat animation has to be so terribly drawn out that it takes longer than needed for the cavalry to take out the routers. It'd be more convenient if the cavalry just swing their swords at boom, the routing units die faster.  9) Artillery units can be glitchy, even in multiplayer. Sometimes, they won't fire their guns no matter how many times you order them to.  10) On the campaign map, the AI controlling Britain, the United Provinces, and France tend to ignore India for some reason, so almost every single time you play this campaign, the Marathas end up becoming an OP faction.  11) There are no marching tunes with fifes and drums on the battlefield for any of the factions. This feature should have been implemented by the developers. I can understand that some players might find them distracting, but an option could be made to just turn off those marching tunes in the game.   12) Naval battles can sometimes be a little glitchy. Ships will sometimes move unnecessarily slow even when you order them to move faster.  This game can still be enjoyed despite all of these problems I mentioned. However, it will never be as great as it could have been. There are, however, a few mods for this game that you can use to make this game more enjoyable. Keep in mind that the mods are, unfortunately, not supported for Steam as there is no workshop.
2503	1	a	Dissapointed that you cannot play as Wallachia &amp; Moldova, as they weren't occupied by Ottomans at that time.  9.9/10
2505	1	a	Great Strategy Game, PvP Battles, Campaign in single player and rule the world. Revolutions, Settlement Uprisings, Native American Campaigns. Very entertaining and like the early Call of Duty games it actually teaches some history.
2507	1	a	So addictive. The real-time warfare engine is the heart of this game, though. The sea battles, sieges, cavalry charges... You won't want to quit until you've taken over the whole world. Couple of hundred hours in and a couple of hundred more to go. Very hard to put down.
2509	1	a	Won a battle against 200 Natives with one artilery unit.   10/10 would assert European supremacy over inferior natives again.
2511	1	a	buy it youll love it.....
2513	1	a	George Washington died of old age during Act Two of Road to Independence.   10/10 for historical accuracy
2515	1	a	Although not everyones cup of tea, if you love mass scale micromanagement this game will deliver.  The odd thing which I think I have been fortunate to have experienced is that over the time I have owned this game I can count the crashes on one hand. Others have not been nearly so fortunate.  You'll also want to turn up the difficulty or you will wonder how the whole world wasn't conquered by this or that faction. In the battlefield the AI is fairly poor despite if you turn up the battle difficulty and is made up for by padding the AI stats. Still there will be times when the enemy will sit there and be happy to let you blow them appart with long range artillery fire. I generally autoresolve as I play for the big picture.  The naval battles are nice to watch but fairly limited in tactics. Basically you are trying to set up favorable fields of fire but generally I was able to manage favorable engagements on the campaign map eliminating the need for advanced tactics. Essentially two lines staggered will completly crush their fleet every time. Unless of course you failed on the campaign layer.  Haven't tried MP yet because I'm an anti-social gamer. So can't say about that one.  I can see why many think this is the weakest entry in the TW series but not for me I enjoy the original Shogun and Medieval the least probably due to their age respectively. Namely the much more limited options available. This one looks good but does have some issues but it is also the only TW game with such a massive scope and for me, sometimes that's all that matters.
2517	1	a	E:TW provided strange but outstanding Total War experience. It was one of the worst games in the series from the technical point of view, with all its bugs and connection issues only outmatched by the horror of Rome 2 itself. But for the reasons I can't fully understand it was a keeper. Maybe that was about a fresh setting, diverse landscapes, revamped city-building, comfortable pacing, huge world to fight for or the first buggy steps into co-op multiplayer, but as a matter of fact it has a sweet nostalgic aftertaste Napoleon or Shogun 2 didn't leave for me. IF CA fixed at least some of its problems, it is definitely worth visiting while waiting for the next installment in TW series.
2519	1	a	Enemies just run around in front of my firing lines, getting shot over and over again until they finally charge at me, problem is they have guns so why are they charging? 10/10
2521	1	a	*Goes as Prussia* *Wants to imitate Colonial-Era Europeans*  *Invades Africa and conquers Morrocco*  *Recruits an army of Africans in Prussian Military* *England and all rest of Europe wants help attacking France* *Captures Paris with an army of Morroccans*  11/10 Would invade France with German Morroccans again.
2523	1	a	This game is as addicting as it is nuanced. It is a turn-based strategy game much like Civilization, but it is far more detailed (it is even more detailed than the previous Total War games that I love such as Medieval or Rome). As a history buff, I also enjoy the fact that I can play as an 18th century power and I will get a message pop up at the start of a turn (in the appropriate year) detailing a major happening of that year in history (like the discovery of Hydrogen or Oxygen, of the first female soldier in the British Army, etc…).
2525	1	a	I believe Empire: Total War is the greatest Total War game of all, with a few qualifications. Of course the undeniable  best  TW game for me was Rome: Total War the First, which revolutionised the series and whatever genres you might want to identify in the wider title, a game which I have dumped huge amounts of hours into - amounts which grow even to this day by the occasional intense, weekend-long binge.  That opening paragraph may sound a bit contradictory - to begin with I call Empire the greatest TW title of all, then I immediately state that RTW is of course the  best , but I am trying to work on a distinction, here.  What I'm trying to say is that ETW was a perfect storm, if you will, a game which came at just the right time, featured just the right shift in scenery and era, brought in just the right technologies and got just the right feel of UI, interaction and general gameplay. I said before that some qualifiers exist and they do - the game is not a perfect TW title - but it gets certain things very, very right.  To elaborate then, I start with the game's position in the series. If memory serves (and really how wrong could it get) the game came after Medieval 2 and the Kingdoms expansion thereof and somewhat logically endured an advancement through the ages to the Age of Empire - but it also came at a perfect technological moment that allowed it to be a true quantum leap over it's direct predecessor in many ways. The upgrade in graphics, UI, gameplay (the introduction of smaller settlements and such on the map) and the addition of naval combat - not to mention the introduction of guns, en masse (more on the flaws of this system a bit later) - all went together to make this game feel many years ahead of the earlier titles in the series, and usher in the later era that we are now enjoying.  The Age of Empire just seems to perfectly lend itself to the Total War idea. Warefare by gun is just that bit more tactical, that bit more impactful and rhytmic. The battles - especially the open battles, far from fortresses and the select range of infuriating consequences to trying to breach walls - have real breadth for elaboration and intrigue...   My lasting memory of a battle in Empire: Total War occured when my Dutch army, emboldened by the easy capture of Norway from the Swedes, marched on their home province only to be met by all the soldiers that should have been guarding Norway on top of the standard garrison. My army consisted of a general's body guard, two run down groups of Cavalry, and three groups of riflemen - we were up against at least twice that number - and many of those units were perfectly respectable, dangerous foes with little militia riff-raff mixed in.  I had retreated from battle once after blindly commiting my army to a seige and pulling out - but that very turn the Swedes marched out to put me to the sword. Terrified, I put my troops to the rear of my deployment zone, on top of a shallow hill with a small but dense wooded forest crowning it, a vague crescent of extra-steep terrain, halfway from the crest and facing towards where the enemy would come from, and another scattering of trees further down the slope but quite a way off to a flank. I arranged two groups of cavalry - including my captain - in the dense forest, and a third group off to the opposite flank behind the scattered trees, while I lined my riflemen along the top rim of the steep section, as best as I could - the rim wasn't wide enough for one group, let alone three.  The battle commenced, and a broad force of enemies set off towards my small group of men. Hanging on by the seat of my pants, I noticed a group of cavalry making a run for the flank of my riflemen that was overlooked by the dense forest, and instantly shot out both of my hidden horse groups to intercept the charge, resulting in a very quick sortie between the advancing lines and my steady riflemen. The banner of the enemy horse group flashed, marvel of marvels, and I took that as a sign to instsantly wheel around and send my horsemen back to the dense forest. briefly pursued, the opposing horse group wheeled away at the line of trees under pot shots from my riflemen, but the battle had only just begun as I sent the horses right back out again more or less instantly to counter-charge into the flanks of a huge unit of footsoldiers who had engaged my left flank. In the mean time I had done more or less the same manouver with my other flanking horsemen, breaking into the flank of a group of riflemen before wheeling away for a second charge to counter the opposing captain as they attempted to augment their advancing rifle troops with a charge by the general's bodyguard. The battle would see-saw mightily as my riflemen gamely held the high ground, wheeling this way and that to stave off probing groups of gunners, while my ragged cavalry units darted this way and that, charging, extracting themselves and charging again, trying always to lock units in pincer movements and circle around behind them to force them to flee.  Miraculously, with only medium losses to ground troops and only about 50% losses to my cavalry units, I eventually forced the entirety of the enemy army to sound a hasty retreat, barring their captain! Noting that I only had one enemy left on the battlefield, I threw everything I could at him - all of my remaining horses charged his larger group from two sides,w hile up the middle charged the remainders of my three groups of riflemen, swords drawn, for the kill. A heroic victory was won that day, and with it my everlasting affection for this title.  Of course, as I have hinted at, this is the greatest and grandest of the TW games in my estimations - mirroring the pomp of the setting - but it is simply not the best because of a couple of isolated by serious flaws.  A) Battle Bugs Sadly, this game suffers from a few bugs in battle situations.   At one point while I was trying to mop up some pirates in the Leeward Islands my dutch riflemen refused to open fire on pirates crouching behind a wall, despite being well in range and themselves fired upon - a group of natives who I had sent creeping around behind and sprinting along the interior of the wall likewise refused to fight the 'dug in' enemy troops unless I simply told them to run through the enemy position, forcing them to automatically swing swords at them. Likewise a group of horsemen - I love me some flanking - who had circled around the  other  way had to sweep through and jump over the wall in question, heading for an empty space in the middle distance, in order to finally extricate the enemies from that wall and open them up to uninhibited, bug-free slaughter.  At another point, funnily enough also against pirates but this time at Port Royale, my troops of the Maratha Confederacy (I was trying to carve out some trade routes in the Caribbean) turned up with five groups of cannon and laid waste to the city walls - but not until I had lots two cannon and crew to invisible walls which forced them to walk in mid air, and this was just a prelude to the catastrophe that would be my attempt to enter into the town through the breaches in the walls - my riflemen just about struggled through in a completey buggy way, as did my elephants and such, but then half a platoon of elephants was cut down by the enemy captain, who despite being the last surviving member of his bodyguard was enjoying some kind of god mode bug as a result of being wedged between the invisible wall of the city gate and that of a section of ruined wall. I ultimately won that battle, but the unmitigated annoyance of trying to seige that settlement put my off seige battles for the remainder of my campaign - autoresolving any town that boasted fortifications.  B) Unplayable Factions I must end now, word limit, but the fact that you can only play the 'major factions' available at the start of the game kills my inner completionist.9/10
2527	1	a	I conquered the world as the French, 'nuff said.
2529	1	a	One of the best total war games in my opinion and the best campaign.
2531	1	a	CAs first real crack at focused firearm comat. This one saw many ups and downs but is still one of the most memorable Total War Games for me, though not the best. It was a truly experimental title for CA. A new engine, completely different combat mechanics, the first title to allow manual naval combat, a new era, one of the biggest campaign maps yet, and the introduction of a tech research tree. It was a breathtaking sight that, once growing pains had passed, delivered a monumental Total War experience that remains the title for which I most want a sequel. Fall of the Samurai showed just how far CA has come with this style of warfare and I cannot wait.   All that being said, the game isn't without its flaws. This was the last Total War title lacking cooperative multiplayer, there are a number a bugs, the AI is predictable, especially when they are defending a siege assault, and as with all Total War titles, the AI plays by a completely different set of BS rules. Including non existant army upkeep, no resistance to occupation, agents with nigh 100% success rates...   Even with its flaws, it is a unique Total War title that offers an experience no other in the series can, for now. Absolutely recommend it.
2533	1	a	A great game. I'd almost go as far as to say that the replay value is limitless. The tech tree is large and interesting, so are the maps. There's a great variety of nations to choose from and plenty of units for each one. Multiplayer is a fun experience as long as you take care to keep the right people out of your servers (IE: clan players and other spammers.) This is to NTW what the MG42 is to the MG3. It's older, and it has its flaws, but god damn it's good. ETW will also probably last you longer.
2535	1	a	Empire Total War is by far the best in the Total war series. The change in gameplay with the addition of rifles and cannon is refreshing and the maps of america and india are a nice change from the stale map of europe that is the standard of most games of this type. Also the ship battles are a big step forward from the previous games. A must buy!
2537	1	a	Great game, classic. Better if you add Darthmod.
2539	1	a	Started a game as Austria. Gave the Puebleo Cannons. Next time I checked they controled all of North America and had footholes in Spain.  42/10 would grant visa to Mexicans again.
2541	1	a	I Personally love this game so much. It maybe old but its just so fun and amazing. They need to make another one that adds the bullet and cannon camera like in Napoleon Total War and mix in some Sniper Elite X Ray Cams. They have to go all out if they make another one where its like the game already has all the mods so large massive numbers. Blood effects and so much more you can possibly add I love this game so much
2543	1	a	Its one of the best multi-player game ever better than rome 2 -1, napo and show!!!!!!!!!!
2545	1	a	This game was one of my first steam games ever. I wouldn't call it an work of art, but the huge campaign map, the beatiful (for it's time) textures and the textbook correct nations are absolutly wonderful. The variety of nations you can playas, from the OP island nation of Great Britain, to the rebelling colonists in the American theartre, and the Rebelling Maratha faction in India, this game's wide, unique and colorful blend of nations and maps are truly something worth buying this game. This is one of the best total war games out there, especially if you love 18th century history. Works perfectly with Dathmod. I highly recomend you play vanilla first, however, just to get the feeling of the great game you just bought. The battle AI could use some improvment though, other than that, great game Sega/ Total War!!!
2547	1	a	The Total War series, who hasn't heard of it? As like all excellent Total War games I recommend you take the time to play and enjoy it in all of its glory. Compared to previous games this one has improved graphics, more complex and in depth micro management and introducing for the first time real time naval battles. What makes this game stand out from the other games in the franchise ( &amp; makes it more interesting) is that you have several major &amp; micro theatres of war. Since the games is set in the time of the 17th century gunpowder units &amp; cannons are a standard sight on the battlefield which may confuse older TW players since the main part of the battle isn't a big mellee charge with an onager or two onager to provide some support but here its all ranged and contains a lot of artillery supprt. The campaign is a little better than in the previous games because the enemy &amp; allied nations are no longer idly passive. The multyplayer has undergone a welcoming change and contains a ranking system &amp; achivements. One of the differences in the games is also that most nations units are the same and the differences between them are their stats, but this is no big problem. On the overall the game is a great step forward from the previous TW games &amp; I recommend this game to every strategy game enthusiast. In the case that I have forgoten to mention anything or the articlle was too subjective please inform me and I will correct it. Thank you.

2551	1	a	this is very good game
2553	1	a	Empire Total War is the continuation of the Total War franchise bringing it into the Napoleonic era of muskets and cannonballs and while Empire manages to maintain many of the good qualities from the series it brings very little new to the table and the ghosts of old flaws that's brought along makes it a very mixed experience.  Rome Total War have become the benchmark by which the new Total War games are made. Almost every feature and design direction taken in Medieval 2 and Empire comes directly from Rome with no alterations or improvements made and while Rome was a great and innovative game the qualities that made it so are no longer unique to the Total War series and Empire suffers because of it.  If you have somehow never played a Total War game before it can be explained fairly easily. You take command of a nation on a turn-based grand strategy map where you build up your cities and recruit armies. Eventually your enemies will meet up with the armies of other nations and you are thrown from the big strategic map into a real-time 3D tactical battle map where you have direct control of the units of your army as you try to defeat the enemy army.  The strategic map has perhaps always been recognized as the greatest weak point in the Total War games and Empire continues this tradition. The turn-based model was never made with the same care as the turn-based games of old and this shows when a small army can walk past an army ten times it's size, conquering cities and raiding the countryside with impunity and still get far enough away that the larger army won't be able to catch up with it creating a sort of cat and mouse gameplay that does your enjoyment of the game no favors.  Some improvements have been made over the previous games, most notably the introduction of a tech tree that, while still based on buildings in your various provinces, gives you a more open approach to customizing your nation. The diplomacy is as broken as ever and the AI still seems completely incapable of even the simplest tasks. The AI on the campaign map is so bad that if it wasn't for the ludicrous amount of cheating it does on the higher difficulties you would be winning every campaign in ten turns or less.  The meat of the game and where Total War made it's name however is the battle map. Gone are the flaws of the campaign map and all that is left is glorious battle with thousands of soldiers at your command.  The problem here however is one that has plagued the Total War series since it's beginning but is even more apparent now that it's made the jump into Napoleonic line combat. The AI is useless. It's not just that the AI is bad, it's that it cannot perform even the simplest of tasks which makes battles against it so trivial that it's almost painful at times. You would think that the developers would have discovered a way for the AI to maintain a formation beyond the first shot fired but every time it happens, the AI falls completely apart.  The simplicity and limits of the game engine is also beginning to show as even though your soldiers are armed with musket and bayonet instead of sword and arrow now the battles still play out in much the same way as in previous games. This might be fine for a Rome or a Medieval 2 but Empire tries to emulate a very different age of war and it does not quite meet the standard of that era. Particularly if you've played the Take Command series of games you will begin to notice just how simple the tactical elements of the game have become.  The battles are beautiful and your soldiers look impressive as they march forward in formation and the sounds are top quality.  If someone who had never played a Total War game before asked me for a recommendation I'd tell him to get the newest one. Empire Total War might be a better game than Rome Total War but that is only a question of age. The Total War series used to be innovative, now they're just shallow repeats with little to look forward to.
2555	1	a	I still remember the time when the French army steamrolled Western Europe and India while it's closest ally, Great Britain, ruled the continent of North America. Today, both parties coexist in peace.  10/10 Would change history again  *EDIT*  Note: If you are trying to install a modification for the game, please know the procedures of installing said mod. Because if you do not know what you are doing, you will end up having a broken game.
2557	1	a	Started a campaign as Venice, made a big fleet, rekt the Barbary states, blocked all trading ports of the Ottomans, Captured the Balkan, made Venetian colonies in America and India, took revenge on my rival Genoa and recaptured Constantinople for christianity with a small army.  10/10 would remove kebab again.
2559	1	a	Love this game, as you can tell by the hours I have on record. For me I enjoy the time period so that's why I got the game. Being a history buff, this game really helps me live out the time period, I don't see any cons what so ever. If you're a fan of history and love a stragey game, Then I HIGHLY recommend this game.
2561	1	a	Empire was my first Total War game and still is the one I play today. With other 250 hours in single player its a game with immense re-playability. For players new to Total War or Turn based stategy with a real time element I would recommend picking up this game alongside its DLC.
2563	1	a	Still alive and kicking as one of my favorite strategy game of all time. Albeit released in 2009, the game is not as smooth and polished as Napoleon Total War. There are small glitches here and there, but you sort of learn to work around them. Nothing game-breaking.  Unfortunately, Creative Assemblies has yet to optimize the multiplayer experience. So a lot of games may drop, lag, have cheaters who don't follow rules, and just downright noobs who don't know what the'yre doing and there's not much player-side control over it.   However, with its flaws, I still find the multiplayer to be much more balanced and enjoyable than Napoleon Total War. Granted I play native americans most of the time, I find that the factions have many different strengths &amp; weaknesses, and the diversity of playing style and tactics are endless. It's also really fun to ♥♥♥♥ arrogant people off by beating them with mere Axes and Arrows.   I also find the strategy to be much more in-depth than Napoleon. NTW just relies on stretching out lines, artillery barrages, and cavalry charges. In empire you have to be much more selective with how you form and move your infantry on the battlefield and which units to assign to different tasks.   Are the expansions worth it? If you want to play online, definitely as it will keep you in equal balance with other players, although you can still win without them. For single player, not really, as downloading expansions like darthmod will give you tons of interesting added-on units.  I don't have over 1500 hours in this game for nothing. Jump in and play. The learning curve is tough at first, but playing online is a good way to get good fast and blow through enemies both in singleplayer and multiplayer.
2565	1	a	Extemely good. Total War with guns.
2567	1	a	Awesome strategy game. I suggest purchasing the special units pack.
2569	1	a	-Playing as the United States -A prussian army lands and tries to invade America  11/10 for realism
2571	1	a	This is honestly one of the best strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Though it is buggy at times, the shear detail and historic aspect are truly great
2573	1	a	This game has a special place in my heart, because it is the game that really got me into the Total War series. The main thing I like about this game, is the campain map. technically, this map doesn't have the most settlements in the entire series, but it has the biggest map in any of the games. You can conquer India, North America and the tip of South America, Carribeans, and Europe. This gives it a more important feel and that your actions effect more people. I also love the variation of units for each faction. The american army had better skrimishers than the English, but the English's line infantry were more regimented and didn't break as easly. I also love the audio for this game. I would find myself scrolling up to a single unit and just listening to how well in sounded when he shot his musket. This is also the first in the series to introduce naval battles that you can play which look beutiful, but can be confusing. The bad part is that the A.I in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen. Half the time, they don't even move, and the other half, they just charge at you with no strategy whatsoever. To sum it up, this game is set in my favorite time period, and besides the cluncy AI, this game does the time period justice.
2575	1	a	One of the most flawed Total Wars but also one of the largest most ambitious ones. A new engine, full of bugs, a crippled new AI system and a poorly explained game. Time has fixed those issues and it's now the best running large scale Total War. To enjoy it you only really need to accept guns in your Total War. You can always fix your bayonets but never leave your guns at home.  Fight and conquer across three theaters of war, the America's, Europe and Indian sub continent. Play with all the larger colonial powers, the (former) colonies and the warring Indian factions. Re-establish the Ottoman Empire or do make some oversea colonies for Prussia that it never had.  It's a bit aged, lacks the fancy features you will find in Rome 2 and the AI still has some glitches but a lot can be modded out and overal it's way better then Rome 2, larger scale then Napoleon and more diverse then Shogun 2.
2577	1	a	In my humble opinion, this is one of the most enjoyable Total War Games today. Sure, it has the typical Total War shortcomings (AI, Diplomacy) but i have not encountered land- and above else seabattles i enjoyed more as in this game. Additionaly the setting is 'fresh'  If you want to conquer the world then i can only recommend this game 
2579	1	a	You can be a Conqueror&amp;Admiral in here. But the bugs also too many. Maratha Confederation Sweden Empire Ankara are the Graphics Killer.
2581	1	a	In Empire: Total War you can play as one of the many Empire's and Nations that are available for play on the Campaing map or if your the kind of Battle fighing person, You can play online battle's with friend's and people online and combine forces in battle or have a duel of the army's of a 1 vs 1 game. If you feel like testing the game's tactic's there are Regular battle's to fight against automated enemy's and allies. In Empire: Total War, I have enjoyed playing as some of the greatest nations known to the face of the Colonial and Napoleonic era's such as ; Great Britain, France, Spain, Prussia etc, There are many features that in-hense gameplay to really make you feel like your a General on a battlefeild or a great Admiral fighting at sea or to be the King or Queen of a Empire and to control what goes on. Personally this game is a total thumbs up to me and I sugjest to buy and play it if you have time for this stratrgy based game in my openion beat's it's succesor ; Napoleon: Total War. Even though NTW has some better graphics, It adds some new features but it is only in the Europe theatre and there are limited nations you can play as, here are them; Britian, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia. In ETW you have over 6 playable nations to play as and expand your empire in the Americas, Europe and India. ETW may have some things that are a downside, but I totally recommand that you play this Strategy-based game.
2583	1	a	When i Play this game i feel im like in The Patriot Movie ! XD  Better than Rome TW 2 but even if there are some bugs or other things u can just download The' Dartmode' &lt;3 
2585	1	a	First Total War game, and still is my faviort after playing Napelon, Shogun 2, Rome II, and Attila. (Not saying those games are bad) The game just has somthing to it that is diffrent from every other Total War game. I would sugest to new Total War players.
2587	1	a	I don't know what happened how did this happen 354.7hrs someone help me
2589	1	a	In 1706, I, leader of Russia, conquered Crimea with General Ivan Mazepa leading my troops into battle.  In 1707, the Crimean people rose up and overthrew the garrison I placed in their lands.  In 1708, with Prince Anikita Repnin leading a second army while General Mazepa was tied up in Dagestan, I marched against them and besieged their holdings in Bakchisaray. Rather than give up without a fight, their forces left the city and attacked my army. I placed my troops on a sloping hill nearby, entrenching my infantry and cannons while my cavalry lay in wait at the crest, ready to charge. I had over 1900 battle-hardened troops at my disposal, veterans, all. They had over 2000, but were mostly comprised of peasant militia, with only a single troop of cavalry with their leader. With the elevated and fortified position at my disposal, I waited for their army to cross the valley below. Their leader rode out ahead of their infantry to scope out the battlefield. As soon as he saw what was waiting for him and his men, he turned and ran all the way back to the city, without so much as a word to his infantry, who kept marching up the hill in the face of artillery barrage from my cannons. By the time the Crimean army reached the top of the hill, two of their regiments were already routed, peppered by my infantry's guns after they were too close for effective bombardment. After 5 regiments of my cavalry charged along their flank, their forces were shattered completely and routed.  By the end, over 75% of their forces were dead on the field, with less than 25% of my own joining them, most of whom were merely injured and would live to fight another day.  Empire: Total War called this a 'Heroic Victory'. It did not feel heroic. Perhaps granting them a period of tax exemption will take the edge off…
2591	1	a	¡¡¡Now on GNU/Linux!!!
2593	1	a	i didnt play a lot of time before i saw that i play of of the best RTS games ever! this game awesome! big map, lot of nations if u buy total war game buy this! 10/10
2595	1	a	Multiplayer is amazing. Nothing better than multiple armies firing muskets at each other, while cannon shots whizz overhead, and mortar and rockets blast the ground around them to shreds. 11/10
2597	1	a	A strategy game is a game played without uz time squeezing masterpiece. If you like a very reasonable price to bulunabilir.ıf a strategy for a bundle that came earlier and strategies do not say you love yourself playing this game.There are kind of a war like sea wars and soil wars.There are lots of kind of soldier and there is something i don't like.this is when i was england,i was ♥♥♥♥ing all countries but when i was ottomans,all countries was ♥♥♥♥ing me....

2599	1	a	This game was a long experince for me but i always tried to conquer the world becasue in this game there are no rules only the BLOOD OF YOUR ENEMIES!
2601	1	a	After a few hours of game,  I recommand it !! :)
2603	1	a	This game right here, is probably one of my favorite Total Wars out there. From fighting in the Americas to the coasts of India this game is never ending action! The battles are amazing even though some people say Napoleon Total War is better, I will say that THIS game is 10x better just because of the sheer grasp of the amount of land there is to explore! From Europe, down into Ottoman controlled Middle East, to India, and finally the Americas. Packed with lots of different factions there is always the ability to be at war or be at peace depending on the type of country you choose to be. The unlimited amount of gameplay is amazing adding hours upon hours of time to spend on this game! 
2605	1	a	Excellent game with unlimited re-playability. Graphics are very good. Technological advances make a huge difference. Real time battles are easy to control and strategy oriented as opposed to a huge brawl. Naval battles are good as well as important cosidering the florins to be made by controlling the trade routes. Three continents to conquer as well as the trade areas offers a huge world. Downside is AI is still not too bright but it can still beat you if you push into enemy territory too deep ,too fast.AI is not totally incompetent though, build up an area and leave it unprotected and someone may decide to invade no matter how far behind the lines, enjoying your previous money making territory as their own.Yes, seaborne invasions of England do occur .Over 1200 hours and still enjoy this game .Maybe i just enjoy the warfare of this era .Never trust the Maratha Confederacy.
2607	1	a	Empire: Total War... where to start, where to start....  After 130 hours spent on this game, I can only disrcibe it with one word: spectacular. I have been an RTS fan since early on, played all the great names from Command &amp; Conquer to Wh40k: Dawn of War. Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan. Starting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air..... The game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army. You can join your friends and fight bots, do 1v1, or a large scale battle of up to 6 players 3v3. Words simply can't desribe the awesomeness of this game, but at least I tried. Buy it, just do it, you won't make a mistake.
2609	1	a	The Campaign can make your head explode, especially if you're an Empire such as Great Britain that has settlements in America and interests in places such as India.   (I couldn't care less if my vassal is getting attacked, it will take a million turns to get there to help!!!)  YOU'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL.   The battles are good, I prefer to kill unarmed units with a line of musketmen and the Road to Independence mode allows you to do just that.   Worth a play.
2611	1	a	Played a little - liked it. Played a little more - still liked it. Played even more with mods - still like it.
2613	1	a	1. Play Prussia 2. Invade Poland &amp; Russia  3. Hitler is happy
2615	1	a	One moment you're strugling to fight off the british as try to gain America it's independence. Next moment you're Invading India to conquer the last bit of land not flying the Stars and Stripes.  Solid 8/10 would freadom the world again.
2617	1	a	Naval battles are the best part of this game!
2619	1	a	Very good game, I recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the world and fight savages and be a warlord!
2621	1	a	Long Rule Brittania
2623	1	a	You can have America take over Europe and India, or prevent America from existing.
2625	1	a	Dang this game is so awesome you should buy it right now!
2627	1	a	Best game! It was a challenge. historic, and an all around fun game to play. Anyone liking strategy and aggressive AI will like this.
2629	1	a	The british navy is the most famous and languished naval power in history. It has boasted such military victories as Trafalgar, and has been attributed with inventing many of the military ideals most modern navies still use today. Their crews are well trained and proud.   And you can wipe them out with a single Spanish Galleon, which never, ever stops being funny.
2631	1	a	Empire Total War is a great choice if you have an itch for Age of Sail/Gunpowder Era game play. For those of you whom may never have played a Total War title this next part is for you.   Total War games are a mixture of 2 common Strategy Game mechanics. You have a campaign board and you have a RTS Battle Mode. For the camapign board think Sid Meyer's Civilization, you control the empires finances, build queues and unit movements in this mode. When you go to fight an enemy force you then go into a RTS mode where the armies involved fight on a map that represents your location on the campaign board. Example, if your forces engage the enemy in a forest then expect the battle mode map to be a forest. If you attack an enemy that is blocking bridge access to the other side on the campaign board you will have to fight accross that bridge in the battle mode map if you want to win. The opposite is true if you are defending.   You can choose to automate nearly everything in this game, wether it be taxes, building queues or even land and sea battles. This makes it somewhat easier to learn the ropes of the game as it can be a bit overwhelming at first but I would suggest going straight for the deep end and learn how to do it all yourself.  Graphically the game looks great with maxed settings.  Audio seems legit most of time but every now and again i notice that some sounds vanish only to return later just as quickly as they left.  Quick note on pacing in the game, if you are new or just havent played in a while it can seem slow to start and in some ways it truly is. Trust that patience is a virtue in the early game because when the shiiyat hits the fan it will test you.  All in all i think Empire Total War is a great game and can certainly offer you many hours of enjoyment. I recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games and wants a colonial era setting in which to strategize.  10/10 would handle the American Revolution properly again 10/10 would watch thousands and angry axe wielding natives vanish in a charge on my lines again
2633	1	a	If you like stategy game amd/or the 18th centry warfare? This game is perfect. Apart from some graphical issues and on easy or normal (which all the people who say the game's AI is horrible seem to play on) the AI is just about as good as a 3 year old child. Apart from that, the game offers over 10 diffrent nations to play as (each with their own starting areas, and unique troops) real time battles, naval battles, send trade ships to go get you trading goods to make a big profit from, and if i was to name all the reasons this game was great, the list would never end.Some of my favorite features are liberate nations(learn how to do by guides or the internet) and get protectorates, and wars of sucsession (which are normal wars but when you leader dies this is most likely to happen). Troops range from militia to the elite british cold stream guards or provencial cavalry (militia cavalry pretty much) to the polish winged hussars and even demi cannons (stationary, low firepower artillery) to mortars, howizters, normal cannons, to low firepower but mobile horse artillery. Or maybe want to be ahead of the other nations techonoligy wise? Build schools and colleges and send gentlemen theri to reaserch military tech, infantry like bayonets,0rtillery for better cannons and better amunition, or naval for better ships, speed and less chances of misfires. Industrail for your better building that get you alot of money, like ironworks, or to make you get even more money from them. And finaly is, enlightment technolegy. This is for getting better schools to reaserch faster, do research faster, better tax income, better trade and even some trade ports. Hope this helped if you want to know the very basics of this game (it is some what complex but it is still easy to learn
2635	1	a	the best total war ever made
2637	1	a	By far the most realistic combat I have seen in a video game that is based around this era. The strategy, skill, adaptiveness, and flexibility required to skillfully achieve victory in this game, per battle or per campaign, is genuinely unlike anything I've seen before. A 9/10 must own for any moderately skilled strategist. My only regret is that the Grand Campaign is not available for multiplayer, for I would like nothing more than to have my companions march a campaign by my side. Besides that, I believe this game, though somewhat dated in graphics by today's standards, Is worth a try for strategy gamers everywhere.
2639	1	a	Conquer! Conquer! Conquer! That's the only reason why I love Total War games! I am very fond of this one in particular due to the size of the campaign map. The use of rifles and mortars is also quite a fun addition! Ship battles can also be easily won if you have the right ship and keep your distance. Generally setting other ships on fire is the best way to scare away the enemy fleet!
2641	1	a	This is the game that warmed me up to the Total War series (and Turn-Based games in general). Glad I played it and I will continue to play this series (not just Empire), cant wait for Warhammer!  Great fun and the graphics still hold up pretty well!
2643	1	a	Ejoyable, hours of campaign but also some great multiplayer action!  10/10
2645	1	a	Great game one of the best strategy games ive ever played.
2647	1	a	I invaded Russia.........And came back as a drunk ally, you explain it? this games magic 11/10
2649	1	a	It's not the strongest entry in the Total War series, but there's something unsettlingly satisfying about ordering thousands of soldiers to march in formation to the beat of a drum as canon fire rips them to shreds...the ranks are formed, and after a few devastating volleys the bugle sounds and the lines begin to charge, bayonets fixed. The oder of battle is lost, and the carngae of war is revealed, the field running red with blood of men sent die in a faraway land, their last thoughts being of a home they shall never see again. Hope that trade agreement was worth it.
2651	1	a	I probably should have recommended and reviewed this game a long time ago... Apart from Civ 3 or Dark Riegn, both of which I played back in the early 2000's, Empire: Total War has been my most played game strategy game and one of my most played games of all time. I love the real time battles in the Total War games. I recomment Empire to anyone that likes strategy games or has played any of the other Total War games. I even like it more than Rome II that just came out before my writing of this review.
2653	1	a	I've really enjoyed playing Empire: Total War.  It has the perfect balance between detail and size. Medieval II: Total War, for instance, has so much detail it's hard to look at.  But Empire is in that happy zone of size versus detail. It has great replay value, because of the level of gameplay details. At the same time, it doesn't get bogged down by virtue of being  too  detailed. This keeps the gameplay moving. I find it particularly refreshing in a Total War title, since I love playing them but get tired of the later-game level of nation management. In short, it doesn't drag you down with administrative tasks as the game gets into the later stages. You can keep conquering enemy nations, instead of keeping your nation afloat with never-ending building management, like in the original Medieval: Total War.  The level of advice in the game is perfect for newbies, or for players returning after a long hiatus. It really holds your hand and shows you the ropes, all without being too intrusive. After you've wrung all you can from the advice, you can turn it down or off.  The new battle mechanics of using largely gunpowder troops is a switch for Total War. Of course, previous titles were dominated by hand-to-hand combat with pikes, swords, and the like. Lining up blocks of infanty, by contrast, may get boring after a while since it has less detail. But that depends on the type of player you are.  Instead of concentrating all of a province's buildings in the region capital, there are now buildings spread throughout the province. For instance, farms, universities, and industrial buildings are spread throughout the province. This makes the game more interesting to look at, since it isn't a meaningless landscape dotted with region capitals. It also gives an added stragegic element to the game: you can pillage these buildings, and thus remove the benefits they provide the other nation. For instance, you can pillage a university and thus take it out of action. It then can't do research for the nation you're fighting. These buildings can be repaired for cash in one turn. But still it puts a monkey wrench in the works, especially if it's an advanced building which is expensive to repair.  The different strategic regions (Europe, The New World, India) feel very balanced. It's especially fun to be fighting in North America around the time range of the American Revolution. India feels very boring, since it's basically an inverted triangle. But still, it has a meaningful level of detail to it. It doesn't just feel like a sideshow, though you can ignore it if you wish.  I like that you can send trading ships, called Indiamen, to different places in the world to bring back valuable resources. So for instance, you can dispatch an Indiaman to the west coast of Africa to bring back ivory for your nation to sell to other nations. It's a good source of income, and I like the reliability and simplicity of it. It's a  very  nice touch.  Diplomacy has a good deal of detail. For instance, if you're allied to a nation, break your alliance with it and then attack it, you'll get a permanent negative rating with most of the nations of the world. They don't like treaty violators! It makes them think twice about engaging in any deals with you. So be careful who you ally with. Don't do it as a convenience which you intend to break 10 turns later. Additionally, there are 'historical grievances' between different nations based on their actual history. So for instance, the United Provinces have historical grievances with Spain because of Spain's attempts to conquer the nation. It adds a nice amount of...landscape to diplomacy. It doesn't feel like you're all just a bunch of random nations dumped into an Earth-like arena with no background. It feels more like actual history.  Unfortunately, you can't play as the United States. I guess they thought that it would be impossible to make it into a meaningful power with any realism. Still, it would have been nice to try! So if you would like to have a part in American history, it will have to be secondary part. For instance, in my first campaign I was playing as Prussia and conquered Britain. This sparked the American Revolution by eliminating the Original Thirteen's rulers across the sea. So you can be involved, but only in a secondary way.  So if you like Total War games, and especially if you'd like one that moves a little faster than previous titles, give Empire: Total War a whirl!
2655	1	a	This is one of the best games I have ever played and if you dont like it thats ok but befor deleting the game try putting on Minor Factions revenge or Darth mod.
2657	1	a	This is the Total War that got me hooked.....after this game i ended up getting most of them including the packs...
2659	1	a	Started as britain and fought on 8 fronts at the same time and won,had a trade ship get attacked by a full armada of galleons and such clicked auto resolve and won,I was out number 3 to 1 used 4 cannons with shotgun ammo shots killed 3000 people and won.never tell me the odds 4189041432/10
2661	1	a	i would not call this game great, but its good enough. its cheaper than napoleon, but the same when it comes to strategy and unit styles, but i like empires cmpaign becuase you have more places to go than europe, im not saying that napoleon isnt as good, its just that empire isnt horrible. i like the time period idea but it does not make the game great. it is kinda broken when it comes the naval battles cuase they are horrible to play. and some of the textures are not quite right for the units.i like the roleplay idea for the road to independence campaign but it needs great improvement. overall i would recommend it but dont expect much of it.
2663	1	a	Best strategie game ever  its complex huge and means what it calls total war  if you give yourself time you can have days of good strategie  i like it more as rome 2 ot shogun 2 because its unlimited you havend a generals limit or else  that what i say before total war
2665	1	a	very good strategy game 
2667	1	a	this game is very historical one of the best games ive ever played
2669	1	a	With the Release of Empire, real modding has been disallowed and locked outside of tweaking a few stats. However, the game itself is very playable if it becomes a bit monotonous as you move outward building your Empire. The Battle AI could do with reading the Art of War, but it is acceptable and formations do mostly hold up though there is little real opportunity for real battle tactics against the mob the AI throws at you as you can form, sit, wait, and destroy the enemy as they attack too easily as they use no guile or formation past the opening moves.
2671	1	a	-Plays vanilla game and enjoys it thoroughly. -Discovers Darthmod UC -immerses self in 18th century warfare for days on end -plays as Britain, conquers, rule britannia. -plays as Prussia, conquers, Preussens Gloria -plays as Saxony, gets frustrated and quits by turn ten... 9/11  I ♥♥♥♥ing live for this game  (I have over 400 hours on this game, steam doesn't record time using darthmod)
2673	1	a	Very competitive online, great history of clans during the game's prime, just a great game overall. Strategical, huge battles, intense melee fights, accurate firefights, and a very compelling campaign. If you're looking for a game to really challenge you, this is the one. Online battles are like a game of chess, one wrong move and you can be in big trouble.
2675	1	a	very interesting and fun game but can get boring at time, campaign is very good
2677	1	a	closest thing ill ever get to becoming hitler. 10/10 would bang
2679	1	a	it is a awesome game 
2681	1	a	This is the best 18th century musket line warfare simulator. horrible launch but is great now with all the patches. Launch score would be 6.5/10 but now a 8/10.  Pros:  12 Great Campagins  Great Tech tree that improves your base units while unlocking unique versions of units  alot of units variety from irish brigade to east company infantry and much much more  Battles are great if your into the time period (may not be your favorite if your not really into the time period)  Big campagin map  Units types stand out like lancers are clearly different from hussars, elite infantry are clearly better then regluars ect.  Campagin that is not too complicated  very good tutorial campagin with road to independence  Great time period        Cons:  a few bugs and annyoing crash here and there nothing game breaking (most can be easily avoided)  AI is not too good  The multiplayer was ruined by a bunch of Call of Duty type trash players  Arillery and cavalry needs to be mirco managed for them to work properly  No multiplayer campagin  extremly overpowered light dragoons
2683	1	a	By far the best strategy game i've ever played. The scenarios are fantastic, but the story mode is even better. They've thought about so much creating the story mode and it is all so damn realistic! If you're looking for a fun game to play- yea play this game. 10/10
2685	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. The only downside is it draws me away fro the homework im meant to be doing. The combat is excellent as are the graphics
2687	1	a	Outstanding. This is one of the most advanced, one of the best strategy games I have ever played. If it had custom empires/custom maps, it would be my favorite game. Ever.
2689	1	a	Easily one of the best games I have on steam. Easy to learn controls mixed with an awesome and detailed campaign and immersive multiplayer and battles
2691	1	a	best of the series.
2693	1	a	Mass genocided tons of Native Americans within the first 20 minutes! 8/10!
2695	1	a	Awesome game. Although a rather late review. It is a great game with a nice number of bugs. :)
2697	1	a	This is a great game , I enjoy to play as Russia , whit its Cossack infantry , and whit Austria , whit it s great hungarian husslers :)
2699	1	a	It's just like a little, handicapped puppy - it's not perfect, but it's trying so hard to satisfy your expectations. 
2701	1	a	This is a great entry into the total war franchise.  - - - - pros  - very balanced  - good unit variety - deep strategic possibility s  - easy to learn hard to master  - - - - cons  -very rock paper scissors when you go unit to unit  - laggy online  - no longer has a bustling player base  - units moral seems really fragile   - - - -wishes  - steam mod support   This game takes place in the colonial era. So guns play a rather large role in this, and because of the era the guns are mostly single shot muzzle loaders. There are also melee infantry, hoursemen (both armed with fire arms and melee weapons) , and artillery of varying caliber.   Landscape is very important in this game because of the surplus of ranged units. Hight as in most games will help your ranged units and slow the advance of melee infantry. Artillery is also helped by being put on hills and the like.  In all honesty melee is not as important in this game as in others. But melee troops are still very useful. Because most units are ranged a melee unit can very quickly destroy their moral or the unit in general. But this goes the same both ways because of the ranged unit being well ranged. So melee are best for ambushes or holding walls.  One of the cons i mentioned above is that moral seems really fragile. Units can brake in a mater of SECONDS. This would be ok if it was mere cannon fodder but even the most elite of units can be broken after one or two volleys of fire then at other times they charge though no problem. The moral system seems unstable and inconstant. -1 point   As mentioned above all the factions are relatively balance because they share alot of units with small changes. The only faction that is at both a disadvantage and an advantage is the Indian nations. Because they are over all more stealthy they are good for ambushes, they also have better melee units from the start of the game, but their range is a lot lower then the European nations.  The online is very laggy if more then two players are involved. This is rather common in total war games. So unless playing 1 on 1 online or playing though LAN i would recommend not putting your hopes into online -.5 points A small complaint i also have is the lack of online campaign. Many other total war games both before and after have this feature.  As mentioned above the unit to unit comparison is very rock paper scissors. But many strategy games are like this and with proper strategy and high ground advantage it can be changed. so because you can counter it I think it evens out. so over all i think it is a 8.5/10
2703	1	a	As a Portuguese, all that I can say is: '10/10 muh Empire, muh colonies, muh superpower'
2705	1	a	This game is real good if you install DarthMod Empire.
2707	1	a	Like it. Really cool and has a lot of historically accurate stuff.
2709	1	a	Best Total War ever Created other than NTW
2711	1	a	One of the best Total War games of you like 18-19th century combat. Campaign opens for you literally the whole world except China and Asia, but you could still get to India. Do recomend, especially if you like building up an Empire, but when you have made one, it becomes a little bit borring as there is not many enemies which could challenge you and put under threat your existance.
2713	1	a	Great, in depth, strategy game. Allows you take an active role in how the game develops rather than restricting you with a 'mission based' campaign. Multiplayer is good, however that is from what other people have told me as, due to my computer, I can't use the multiplayer. Anyway, great game, recommended to all strategy fans.
2715	1	a	A very fun game on the revolution the only Total War with the USA.
2717	1	a	a great Total War game.  I love this time period and although the naval battles are hard and uninteresting the rest of it is a ton of fun.

2721	1	a	Great game, needs multiplayer campaign.
2723	1	a	Starts as Spain Bad choice Britain declares war Lose provence  Anex New Spain Rake in cash RIP Great Britain  10/10 would defy the laws of the universe again
2725	1	a	202 hours, need I say more? Ok I will! Absolutely one of, if not the best title in the Total War line. With the absolutely breath taking grasp of the campaign map or the massive battles, both land and sea, or a combo of both, this game has a great ability to draw you in and before you know it....... Its almost 7 years later , you now sport a mid chest length beard, got married and had a child. I find myself adding at least 10 hours a week to my already vast amount of TIME WELL WASTED on this title.  100/10 Creative Assembly, well played... GG. My babysiter also says thank you, you payed her school tuition, would neglect offspring again!
2727	1	a	20 vs 20 battle is epic.
2729	1	a	i bought Total War Grand Master Collection. recommended. Very nice game!!!!
2731	1	a	Nice strategy game! I found the Happiness a difficult thing to master, and the camera used durring battles leaves a lot to be desired. Otherwise, a fulfilling game. Would be interesting to extend the timeline to the late 1800s.
2733	1	a	Top Game, i would have my children with it if i could its that good
2735	1	a	Empire Total War is the elite strategy game. It might not have the graphics or the concepts of Rome Total War 2 but it still is loads of fun. I reccomend this game because it is so fun. The maps are beautiful and so is the warfare. And especially the DLC (Downloadable Content) The DLC is so cheap, and is worth it. And this game is so great to me because it was the first one I have ever bought on Steam. These were some reasons on why Empire Total War is a great game to download!
2737	1	a	One of the best strategy games ever! Must have game!
2739	1	a	Fun strategy game with good management system!
2741	1	a	More complex than other games in this series, harder to learn but one of the best in the Total War franchise
2743	1	a	For days upon days I have played this game, not going outside and having a social life.... Days well spent!
2745	1	a	Freak'n muskets MAN! How could you resist!?!  Also this is a lot more fun with Darthmod :D as it improves a lot of the game's features.
2747	1	a	I LOVE THIS ONE So Epic Game
2749	1	a	this game takes total war to a new level
2751	1	a	Good game, the new UI needs some getting used to if you're familar with M2TW or RTW..   A must have for any TW fan.
2753	1	a	Love it. Great game.
2755	1	a	i recommend this game for anyone who loves military strategy or history
2757	1	a	Amazing game. Good graphics Nice storyline. This game got it all
2759	1	a	i for one am a huge fan of RTS and this one of the better ones that played
2761	1	a	So very buggy but if you want a great game set in the classical era, you'll find none better than Empire: Total War
2763	1	a	Better than Jennifer Lawrence's tatas
2765	1	a	For those who want to have a massive empire. 
2767	1	a	Well dispite constant bugs ni the AI  its ok i guess
2769	1	a	Excellent game when used with DarthMod.
2771	1	a	great game
2773	1	a	Empire is one of the biggest Total War games you can get today. Spanning over about 1/3 of America, Europe and India.   Because of the huge scope you get a staggering 20+ factions in game minor and major nations. With a nice number of them been playable and with the hack or two you can play as them all.  The amount of nations means this is more of a challenge but the combat can be a bit stale. Unlike past game it’s all guns and odd melee combat as really, gun combat is simple with only a few tactics needed to give a clear victory.  This is the main down-turn of the game, the best part of the game has to be its small micromanagement system and upgrades for regions on the map and not in the city is a great addition, sometimes later in the game managing all this is hard but non the less rewarding to the dedicated player.  Huge map, plenty of factions and plenty of lands.  Downside: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ diplomacy, a little bit overbearing for the average player. Stale combat.  Easily a 8.9/10
2775	1	a	This game is for does who wants to feel the power of the European colonial period. The battels are very good.
2777	1	a	This game is one of the most popular and most addiction yet,Well..,For me Of course!
2779	1	a	I had to go back to a 5 yr old game, and damn this beats Rome 2 Total War anyday.
2781	1	a	Empire is epic but not flawless. The Age of Sail is captured very well. The 'Encyclopedic' notes describe many everyday details of the time, and are written simply and to the point. Adapting to the tactics of the age is required -- trying to play Empire like Starcraft will result in defeat. Suffice to say that there were logical reasons why the armies of the day formed firing lines, and Empire made me understand them. There is a wide range of nations to choose from, and all require different approaches. Empire should be stable, but the AI suffers from mental instability, in battle and especially in the campaign map. Modding is practically a requirement, and I always mention Darthmod in that context.
2783	1	a	Empire: Total War takes us away from the battlefields of both Ancient and Middle Aged Europe and Middle-East and takes us to the Empires of Europe during the 18th Century. Muskets and Cannon now determines who is the most powerful in all of Europe, Improved graphics and gameplay makes the game more exciting and stunning for Total War fans. Campaigns follow George Washington as he revisits the past from the development of Jamestown (1607), to the French and Indian War (1740's to 1750's), and to the American War of Independence (1775-1783). Not only can the battles between the European powers take place in Europe and the Middle-east, but also the Colonies of North America and South America and to the Colonies of India. Trade and expansion is key to your nation's victory, expanding out to colonies and your Empire's borders are crucial. The century turns to the the advancement of technology and development of new forms of Government. A time when the system of Monarchy seems to crumble while Republics and Democracies rise. Revolution and Colonization has made the 18th Century one of the world's most crucial centuries in all of the World's History. Will you reign or will you revoutionize a new Empire, the choice is yours. The times of Royal familes and difference in social class lays in your hands, will you preserve it or will you destroy it?
2785	1	a	its pretty strategic, but when u capture countries it gets very fun. buy it
2787	1	a	I completely recommend this game. It's already a few years old, so I would advise to wait for a sale perhaps... but considering that I have spent that many hours on Steam playing this game (and many hours off-Steam as well), even paying the full price does not mean you'll feel ripped off. You're not only buying quite a lot of game with your purchase, you're also buying the best single-player experience any Total War can bring you.  Total War is a series that combines the most massive and spectacular battles you will find in any game with the building and managing of an empire in single player. In multiplayer it's the best game of chess you can have. This particular Total War is set in the early Modern Age (1700-1800), and for the first time includes line-infantry with muskets as the backbone of an army and not a melee unit, which makes for a unique Total War. In this era, the European countries were involved in a lot of wars with eachother while they conquered several continents and established trade routs with most of the rest of the world, and I do not know of any other media that encompasses that much of this era like in Empire: Total War.  From my point of view, this is the last of the true and classic Total War games. I have played every Total War (including Shogun) and my favorites are Rome 1 (not rome 2, absolutely not rome 2) because of the way it represents the classical era, Empire because I am personally very interested in this era as well and it is unique in the ranged combat with muskets and I love Shogun 2, because it simply has the best multiplayer. There is also a stand-alone expansion of Empire about the conquests of Napoleon, something I had been anticipating for many years, but I didn't like it enough. It's too limited. I also don't appreciate a lot from the medieval era in general. It's chaotic, it's too religious/christian, there is no progress, there is death, decay, famine and the plague and Medieval Total War games represent this fine, I don't like it.  Why do I consider this the last Classic Total War? Well, Total War is a game that, as you play, can teach you stuff. Like in Rome1 you learn that clear glass was invented, in Empire you get info along the way about what happened in the 18th century and it was a lot. In fact, the only good description I can find about my 'religion', Secular Humanism, I found in Empire Total War. This is also the last Total War in which the campaign map is open, you can send your armies where you want and you're not stuck in corridors like in the latest installments. However, it is the first Total War to include a tech-tree and naval battles (and naval battles were very spectacular in this era!).  The 3 continents you can explore with armies and conquer are Europe, North and Middle America and the Indian sub-continent (you can walk from Western-Europe to India if you please, or sail around Africa). There are also a few trade regions to conquer using just the navy: the east coast of South-America, the west coast of Africa, the strait of Madagaskar and the East-Indies. Every region has it's own feel and it's own enviroments, cultures, empires and people.  The units you command are also unique for each culture. Yes, warfare was a lot about standing in lines facing eachother firing lead balls back and forth and then reloading for quite some time, the native americans for instance are better equiped for guerilla style battles combining melee with light infantry equipes with muskets or bow and arrow. Along the tech-tree you unlock new units to build and command, artillery changes from simple big cannons to a whole specrum of weaponry. Ranging from mortars to puckle-guns (rapid fire musket, very early machinegun) and stuff in between. Cavalry also comes in many flavors, dragoons that melee on horseback but function as line infantry dismounted, full melee cavalry and the cavalry even gains horsedrawn cannons as technology is invented. And the ships! Oh man, imagine the big ships of the line with over 40 cannons on each broadside, 2 lines come within eachothers range... just crank up the sound to really loud!  Like most Total War games, the game has improved a lot because of mods, Empire is no exception. Even for new players I would recommend to install and use at least Darth Mod, which can be found in the Steam Workshop. More units are also available with mods, but I'm not sure which one to recommend. But the Darth Mod really improves the ai and the feel of the game.  Every Total War has it's own features and it's own feel to it. Personally I find this installment the best in single-player of the entire series. I have had some really tight battles in the campaign. In Empire it is possible to position your men in some buildings, so making a last stand gets it's own feeling to it. Your men firing from the windows at incoming soldiers while your lines of infantry try to hold the lines in front of that building, untill the fight turns melee when the bayonets are pointed at eachother.  And I haven't even mentioned the historical battles that come with each Total War, you can reenact battles that actually took place and with a historically similar setting and armies to command. Pitching you as Washington vs the Brittish and many others. There is a demo available here on Steam, in it you can play at least one of these historical battles and get a glimpse of what is in store for you when it comes to battles, but if you like games like Civilization or RTS games like Age of Empires and you haven't tried Total War at all, you will love it!
2789	1	a	In my opinion, THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! Worth every penny. I could go on and on about how awsome this game is, but to sum it up: You may pick from al selction of nations from the 1700s, from France to the Ottoman Emprie to Russia, and many more! Control world trade of the 1700s, and get all of those good resources, and make some MONEY! It is in the enlightenment, chose to help these new ideas grow and even become a republic yourself, or enforce the way of old! Turn your army into a invinceable war machine and conquer the whole campaign map, which streches from The Americas to Europe to India! GREAT GAME.
2791	1	a	this is such an awesome game 
2793	1	a	Showed the Russians the true meaning of winter, got destroyed... Next time, attack them in the winter instead of taking them skiing
2795	1	a	I love this game, I'm not the best at it, mostly because I'm used to Rome: Total War, but it's great. This game stays true to the Total War series while still adding more to it.
2797	1	a	You see, I bought the elite pack which contains the DLC and original game, although it was a bit pricey...  Anyways, back to the game. Empire is quite different from the other games in the series because it allows Naval Battles! On this unique experience, you control your army on the 7 seas, versing A.I. or real people online or locally. It can get quite intense, as your ships may flee if damaged, but there are also contreversol wins!  The game also allows you to (as I mentioned earlier) to play online with friends, or random people. The problem with online matches though, is that if your internet is bad, you must drop from the game. This can lead to frustraion from the opposing player. You can also do quick Naval or Land matches (Although, finding a game in the quick section is difficult.) You can team up and join an alliance in online matches too! They are quite intense! I prefer playing with friends, 'cause im so good at the game and I beat them :3.  The Total War Series has never been known for graphics, but I have to say this game suprises me. My favourite part is seeing my men run into my enemy and watch the battle. You can see them have little battles with eachother! It looks quite realistic, as after the batttle you can see all the dead men that have fought.  Overall this game is meant for RTS players who enjoy a good online battle. This game is simple to manuver and comprehend. This is my favourite out of the Total War series (personally.) Overall, It definately fed my hunger for a good bloodbath and RTS game. I give it a 8.5/10!
2799	1	a	This game remains one of my favorites despite being so old. It's one of those classics that sticks out and ages really well.
2801	1	a	This game works 100% buy it if you want to wait 300 seconds to play a game then be dropped immediatly, seriously tho its so fun i have 3 hrs on record and i played 1 game
2803	1	a	Turned-based-strategy at its finest moments.
2805	1	a	This is a brilliant game which combines strategy and fighting
2807	1	a	Awesome game, very fun to make custom battles and a pretty fun campaign.
2809	1	a	Step 1. scroll up step 2. add to cart step 3. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2811	1	a	This product has been certified anime-free.  9 of 10.  The first TW game not to 'feature' huge slabs of cardboard UI that fills up the screen. Lovely!
2813	1	a	Played as Sweden, Invaded Russia in the winter, kicked the ♥♥♥♥ out of poland, made an alliance with the ottomans, beat the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of Denmark, killed some unarmed farmers with grenadiers, and controlled all of eastern europe and most of western europe, army got killed by farmers with pitchforks. 420/69 would Sweden again.
2815	1	a	Love it.
2817	1	a	One of the Best 'Total War' games out there
2819	1	a	Fun grand strategy, good naval combat.
2821	1	a	EXCELLENT GAME, BEST IN THE SERIES 
2823	1	a	The Grand Campaign's map (SP) is so large. There's almost whole world geography. But; the diplomacy is not good enough. There's no way to liberate nations, request nations to get a war against another nation, breaking alliences, trading embargoes etc.  By the way there's same problem on the each game that Napoleon TW and Empire TW. It is an historical fail. Crimean Khanate, Degastan and Georgia talk in 'Russian Language' but in the history they talk in; Crimean Tatar, Chechen and Georgian languages.  And there's Greece talking in Turkish. It's kinda fail too.  Also there's lots of bugs and glitches on the MP of the Empire Total War. But I recommended this game because of the size of the map, being a fan of Total War and nation counts. There's lots of Major and Minor nations.
2825	1	a	As the Total War Series free weekend comes to a close, I would like to recommend Total War: Empire, not only is it another great total war game, there is much more focus patience and strategy, than there is in the older games, with there more aggressive style. Keep in mind, this is all just my opinion based on how I played these games, however like any of the Total War games, each one is different enough that it would take you actually playing them all to know what one you like most!
2827	1	a	Empire Total War is somewhat comparable to Rome Total War; it has a huge campaign map and an amazing story line that lasts for a very long time. From land to sea, from blizzard to Hurricane, Empire Total War is mother of all Total War games.
2829	1	a	Love The Game!
2831	1	a	Native American eviction simulator 11/10 would genocide again
2833	1	a	Another great total war game. Own it.(not that every total war game is good,just saying)   Still has great gfx,a few shadow flickers but it still holds up really well maxed out.  IMO the best total war,cause i love line battles and the campain map is huge.    The worst part of any total war is the AI..this games AI is the worst you have ever seen in battle.AS most battles you will think you are playing MTW 2 still.Very disapointing.DLC does seem to fix this tho,i got all of the DLC and most of the battles now are pretty epic.  Very cool units tho through out the game,some DLCs to bolster the roster if you wish. I can't talk much about the sea battles as i always auto solve them.  Diplomatic realtions in this game are crazy,as the AI is below par and can not really do anything other then spam weak units for the most part and declare war or ask you for alot of your lands..just plain broken.DLC fixes them spamming for the most part,now for me they have to many good units..LOL    1) Darthmod is as good as a mod can be for this game, worth a look. or 2) just DL a small file called general andys sound pack. Makes the musket sounds so much better its badazz.And very easy to install...you delete one sound pack and just plop his in..done.  its worth 10 to 15 bucks or on sale as even some mini mods fix the game.  This game will be in my top 10 games in my lifetime...unless they do a remake.
2835	1	a	Very good, get darth mod, makes the game amazing
2837	1	a	great game good campane and good mutialayer. fun to play with friends and online this is one of the best games on steam and it is one of my favorits. the battles are cool this is how you tell if you are a good leader and i am a good leader and so can you.
2839	1	a	Some people call this the worst total war game, HOW. Seriously it is the best total war that I have played other than rome 1, Napoleon was laggy, slow, and the animations were funky, Shogun was boring but this game was fun. It was not fun, it was EPIC, Reccomeded
2841	1	a	Absolute best turn based stratagy game out there.
2843	1	a	At the core of the game, its great. if you buy this game make sure you go on the total war centre and download the ' DarthMod ' mod . This mod fixes all the AI issues and adds new factions from the start as well as adding new units . The base game is good but the AI just ruins it for me and the mod is very easy to install and use.
2845	1	a	I was playing as Sweden first the russian declared war on me, I beat them after about 20 turns or more now my empire is HUGE. So after I beat the russian i took a fleat of ships, loaded them all with line infantry and canons, went to north america attacked the 13 colonies took all there land but also now my british are at war with me so I saild a few ships and army there took them all out, they offer me a peace treaty so I accepted it. Now my empire is really strong I feel unbeatable so I started a campaign on the ottomans lost half of my men against farmers with pitch forks (I had line infantry), finally i took one of the citys of the ottomans. But it was not long untill 3 armys attack my new conquered city, they all have elephants with poeple riding on them with guns so now I lost the battle so my city was recaptured my the ottomans. Now its my turn so I send my men down south to attak the ottomans I attack some of there armys and farms, I could not move my men down any more so i end the turn, all of a sudden the austrian declared war on me, so now I need to attack from 2 fronts. After about 10 turns ottomens and austrian took all of my captured rusian citys, they pushed my back all the way to the motherland, now im ♥♥♥♥ed I half of my army is at north america fighting, so what i did was I loaded all of my men into ships and saild back the sweden it took me a few turns but good thing my men manage to hold the invaders back. So now my whole army is at the motherland, first I tried to make a peace treaty with them but the dident accept so I sent my men to attack but lost to the ottomens now im really ♥♥♥♥ed (at the mean time i lost all my Citys to the natives) so I loaded my last few ships and men and sailed for india I got there after a few turns i attack the united provinces small island in india won the battle also at the same time my main city in sweden was captured by the ottomens good thing i won the battle with the united provinces or it would have kicked my out of the game. So now I have to go eat (Dinner) i was about to save my game then it crashed took me 4 days to play saved only 3 times lost some of my progress but it was still fun to make history and kill hundred of civlian and soilders. 10/10 would play agian
2847	1	a	First of all this game is awesome! 99/100!  This is a fantastic Strategy/War game. Great graphics with a good multiplayer experience. Pretty realistic and historically accurate with units and ships. There are 4 online gamemodes to choose from which are: Land, Sea, Siege and Scenario. If you like to control armies, then this game is for you! The single player campaigns are quite interesting and worth it. There are plenty of DLC's to get to make the game even better. Only some minor gliches where you somehow desync out of a match but other then that this game is great.  I really recommend this game. :)
2849	1	a	A step forward for the series, Empire still has some rathe obvious flaws that play-testing would have easily highlighted, including a lack of Swiss nation or even region and the insistance that some nations are Major and some Minor, that a single state United States is more important to the two state Venetians is sad. The DLC is pointless and overpriced, the game insists on a very European-centric perspective and the game does crash occasionally, but it is worth buying when on sale.
2851	1	a	Jean Kirstein approves of this game.
2853	1	a	This is an amazing game if you love history and strategy. Although, it can get pretty weird sometimes, for example, i was Russia and for no reason whatsoever, England became a republic where the ruler was a Lord Protector, no idea what was going on there...  Overall it is one of my favourite games, even though it could have been a lot better.
2855	1	a	at the beginning it can be a little bit frutrated cause is more complex tha MTW2, but u will love it. If u love startegy this is ur game.
2857	1	a	empire total war if you compair it too the other titles of current , it has a lot to be desired , mods bring it alive , dont get me wrong its great to play sometimes but it just seems too.... out of touch overall 6/10
2859	1	a	-Released Brittania from France because I thought it would hurt them -Turns out they weren't greatful, and they started out with a mega army -France bribed them/seduced them -Brittania joins france in an alliance -I declare war on Brittania with my allies, then france joins, then italy. -I started the first world war.  10/10 would start a world war again
175	0	a	I've tried to justify this game in my head so many times, but I've reached my limit; Empire: Total War is complete garbage. There's a fantastic game hidden deep beneath the countless bugs, but these bugs are so game-ruining that even after six years Empire feels like it's unfinished and still in development. The A.I is ridiculously poor, during sieges the infantry refuse to shoot, or cannons knock down their own walls, and if the computer is the attacking faction the game seems to know that the A.I won't be able to attack on its own, so it cheats. I've started sieges with sections of my walls already knocked down, and sometimes the enemy need only come into close proximity of my gates for the computer to unlock them for the A.I. More often than not the infantry units simply walk around the map, allowing themselves to be killed or routed. I've installed one or two mods to help with the A.I, which has improved it slightly, but sieges still remain horrible affairs, with soldiers trying to shoot through walls, or even killing men on their own team. The combat aspect of this game is utterly broken, and considering that this is the crux of Empire's gameplay it leaves me to wonder why it has such glowing reviews.
176	0	a	Im really into game, its just pretty etc etc. And as a fan of Total War I can say its pretty good. BUT its bugged as hell, even after all those years they cant fix the autosave crashes, memory loss, corrupted saves and AI likes to freak out during the siege. Grab it for 2€ on some sale but the game isn't worth more. Oh and half of the achievments is bugged :)
177	0	a	I can only recommend this game if you intend to play with mods. It's way to basic and has some serious AI problems...
2861	1	a	This is a good strategy game, but for those of you who've not played any total war games previously, I recommend playing the game on easy mode. This is because there are a lot of faction who are able to gang up on you.  This game allows you to pick a faction and command their army. You can create a larger economy, and thus a bigger army to expand your operations.  You are able to partake in diplomatic relations to create trade deals and allies. Alternatively, you can use this feature to bribe your way out of 'sticky' situations, or you can even use it to declare war on another faction.  I would give this game a 7 and a half out of 10.  The above score would be higher if there were not a few flaws within this game, such as the unbalanced auto-resolve feature, and a few other things I can't be bothered to remember. 
2863	1	a	One of my favourite Total war Series because its consist of Europe,Asia,Afrika and The New World. Great gameplay and graphic
2865	1	a	The game offers a substantial amount of content, however the product is in all ways underwhelming. It is quite obvious that the game had much more potential that was left uncapitalized on. Having played both Empire and Napoleon Total War, it is apparent that Empire would have, could have, and should have had the overall polish and refinement of battlefield controls that were found in Napoleon. As a whole, both games are rather enjoyable, however I would suggest Napoleon Total War instead, for fans who are significantly more interested in the battlefield experience.
2867	1	a	Empire Total War might not be one of Total war best game, but is one hell of a FUN and Addicting game which got me playing for nearly a year! The game sets in 18th century earth and have tonnes of guns(not machine gun or rapid fire weapons of today sadly:( )and a huge map streching from the americas in the wests, to fricking india to the east.It does suffer from AI failures and glitches,but heck, who gives a damn about that crap, its a total war game that combines historical realism and total war domination to make it a 200% experience of conquering and warring in the world.To any strategy game fans like me,you guys better prepare yourselve in the arts of war cos to be a awesome and badass conquer, be like julius caeser in his saying: VENI, VIDI, VICI!
2869	1	a	arguably the best of tw, over rome II. a fantastic and utterly absorbing strategy game - the kind that makes you think about your next moves while you are supposed to be at work or talking to the inlaws about pruning their mulberry tree.  if you love turn based eg civ, this is another dimension. if you don't know the tw series, this is a great first stop and will absolutely grab you. anyway, enough of wasting time talking to you. those annoying swedes are compromising my northern borders and i'm trying to get my hands on mysore. and there's only 46 hours left in my weekend. bye.
2871	1	a	Very nice Real time strategy game
2873	1	a	very reilistic and fun to play
2875	1	a	Amazing strategy game. While a bit old, I still think it is one of the best in the franchise, and graphics and gameplay still feel up to date.
2877	1	a	I cry tears of joy just by looking at the title of the game
2879	1	a	This game keeps you coming back for more. For set battles or for some nation building, Empire Total War has long been a standard go to when unable to decide what to play.
2881	1	a	good game worth getting
2883	1	a	;
2885	1	a	People are right. It is glitchy. I've raged quit many games and had to restart many games due to glitches. The first major glitch is invisable troops, you could send 3 line units to a unit of rifleman thinking you'll win easy. Than BOOM appears out of no where a unit of troops is sitting there waiting for you probably thinking wtf were you thinking, lol. The multiplayer is okay.... but abunch of rule breakers that ruin it. The singleplayer isn't my style.... I don't know how to explain it, but I like medieval 2's single player much better. After playing it for a while I do like it, but it isn't my favorite total war game.
2887	1	a	Honestly, that is one of the very few TW games i have ever played many hours and not even fought battles in RTS mode.  8/10  You can eazily win any Battle, with just Autoresolve and not even trying... Talking about the Campaign in normal mode. Since i am not that hardcore to waste hours upon hours of non-stop playing this kind of games. :) or am i?  Still very nice game. Enjoyed it a lot. Check out Youtube videos to see more real gameplay ;)
2889	1	a	I only have 2 problems with this game, one of wich is my fault and could use some help with. Anyway my first problem is that getting technologies takes like 8 turns. The other wich i hope someone could put down and help me with, is whenever i go on the battlefield, my game crashes after a wile. There are multiple reasons for this, but it mostly is my computers fault. Besides this it is an Amazing game. I highly suggest it to all strategy gamers and hope you enjoy. 
2891	1	a	buggy... Like any other total war game, but when you can actually play it's great
2893	1	a	It's all yours for the taking. Every playthrough. All of it. Go take it.
2895	1	a	This game is between Medieval 2 and Shogun 2, it has some similarities between bot of them.so ill mention the good and the bad.I like to mention the key difference between the TW games whit this one and that is gunpowder, almost all units are ranged, that means that melee combat takes a backseat, and you need to properly position your troops in shooting lines in order to achieve victory and not let your flanks fail, also artillery is very important now.   THE GOOD 1-Three theater to play in, Europe,America and India and 4 trading regions. 2-The ability to expand on another theaters whit factions that never established overseas empires(Sweden Poland) 3-Very different way to battle than the rest of total war games. if you play whit a melee mind you will fail here. 4-Factions attitude towards you and knowing why some factions doesnt like you is my favorite part of the game.(before i used to go crazy not knowing why some factions hated me etc etc) 5-Different goverment system Republic, Contitutional Monarchy and Absolute Monarchy.(some factions may like your or hate you if they are of the same or opposed goverment type) 6-Different types of religion.Hinduism,Islam,Catholic,Protestan,Animisn and Sikhism(although i dont know why there Sikh there no main factions that has the religion,only a minor one and it appears if it rebels in punjabi region) 7-Emergent factions, this factions appear in certain regions if they rebel in their cities(example or if you eliminate the mayor faction in their main theather for example Spain. if you eliminate Spain on Europe their territories in the americas will divide into 3 factions Mexico,Gran Colombia,Pirates, or if said destroyed factions conquered some territory they will revert back to their original owners. 8-Minor factions add a whole new level of diplomacy and there are quite a few of them.Although they rarely expand. 9-The researh tree.  THE BAD 0-few factions to choose from, and they feel and have the almost the same units, except Ottoman and Maratha.They should have been more Non-european factions. 1-Game frezzes when you press ESC ALT. 2-I finished the american campiagn and havent got the American faction yet. 3-When a town is being sieged, you cant position well your troops,when they are manning the cannons,also the units tend not to shoot their enemies when below them. 4-Game crashes from time to time. 5-Diplomacy removed the following option, Attack this faction,Break alliance whit faction. 6-Agents spawn randomly not when one needs them.(in one case i had about 10 missionarys and i dint even knew where they were) 7-some regions have individual towns where they grow, intead of being regions themselfs.(example france is just one region it should have been divided up at least into 3 or 4 regions,so if you lose that region you lose a huge deal of land . 8-Campaign winning conditions should be more free. for example playing as Sweden you need some regions in russia in order to win, that means that engaging in a alliance whit said faction impossible.there whould be a FREE MODE where the winning condition is just to capture territory not from some factions. 9-Naval battles are not enjoyable. 10-Africa theather not present,Africa would have been a very fun and nice theater to play in would have some unique factions. 11-India Theather should have had more factions on it 1 or 2 more.   I have to say that this game is good, but it feels like they had more ideas but they dint implement them i blame SEGA i think they pushed them into finishing quickly (you know production) the main reason i say this is beacuse of the Mughal Empire they are cited in the major factions window(all mayor factions are playable) but this one isnt playable.. but the weird thing if they have their own unique units. Also some factions have unique units for example Scotland(emergent faction).
2897	1	a	I intend to continue to play this game, being ex matelot. Possibly find the best way to fight other better eqiuped ships using different ships. i have been using fifth class for now and seem to be doing well. The land forces are a bit difficult but willingly I will test them differently. I will get back later  ARNY of HORSEFAIR
2899	1	a	That game don't have the best opinion in Total War fans community, but truth is that was breakout in TW. First part with real border and reinforcments system. Entire region counts due to need to defend/atack factories on it ect. Of course first TW with naval warfare. Battles are really tactic , you need to learn how to use and control your units properly because if you just right click to atack it will coust you. And first time we got almost global map/maps.   Between that is enormous amount of bugs, non realistic things or just stupid things like diplomacy and battle AI. But.. most of it you can solve by instaling proper mods - a lot of them, a lot of reading and work to get your bundle working but when you finish you got realy good strategy. And that is why i'm, recomending Empire. Napoleon is even bettert but lack of mods there and map with few BIG empires for me don't give that gameplay i like.
2901	1	a	Bought this game for 8 bucks with all Dlc... Used the money I saved to buy tea while I crushed the Spanish and French. I love this game, so buy it.
2903	1	a	Neat.
2905	1	a	This is one of the best games i have ever played.
2907	1	a	Near perfect game, ever amusing. If you're looking for a good 'ol RTS game to amuse yourself, this is it!
2909	1	a	An great Real-Time &amp; Based on turn strategy game , i highly recommend it
2911	1	a	Great Co-op Features!
2913	1	a	Empire Total War.    First of all, Empire Total War is the first Total War title to feature naval battles (which I suck at). But the community had been asking for this for ages. So, I'm glad it finally came to be.   Gameplay wise. The battles are fun weather it be a massive battle for control of a nations capitol or a small skirmish to harass an enemy force. The campaign map is massive in size and would take ages to fully conquer (Most I ever got was 75% or so). Two things I dislike about this game is the A.I pathing and the A.I. politics. When it comes to pathing its okay and I get it can be hard to do with units made up of a hundred men but when of these men get stuck trying to walk through a cart its brutal. For some reason when one guy gets stuck the whole unit looses the ability to move, shoot, or follow orders properly. Then the politics. The computers are down right awful at times you can offer then every cent you have for one piece of tech and they'd decline.  Other those two details its a great game. The massive scale, the awesome battles, the variety of units, the tactics, the maps, the world map all work together to make a great game.
2915	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played i reccomend all of the total war series especially ROME
2917	1	a	Despite having major issues in the begining, crashing, bugs etc, I really enjoyed playing this game. Like the other Total War games it has a mix of a turn based campaign map where you build up your Cities, Towns, Infrastructure and strategicaly move your troops. Real-Time battles from Open Fields and Seiging Forts to Sea Battles with fleets of heavy first rate ships of the line.  Still the game has issues but they can be looked past, because who doesn't love conquering enemy nations with several 'stacks of doom'.  Pros : Game looks great on high graphics settings. Sound is Great. Great Ship battles with a veriety of ships. 3 different Continents to conquer - Americas, Europe and India. Large open fields to fight on with large army's. Historical Battles. Able to save presets for troop selection (Multiplayer and custom battles). Different victory conditions. Multiplayer, though you don't really see any games on it any more (luckily all the achievments are soloable against the AI).  Cons :  Diplomacy needed alot more work, AI can be completely stupid when it comes to the negotiations asking for rediculas things. AI on open field battle needed a bit more work, but its not really noticable here when your having fun slaughtering them all lol. The battle results - Heroic victory etc displays wrong. Poorly Optimized for AMD Graphics cards because its sponsored by Nvidia. Kill 1 million enemies Achievment... ugh this is 1 boring grind, 400+ hours and I haven't hit 200k kills yet.  My advice is to wait for when it's on sale but it's still too good of a game to wait for that :P
2919	1	a	Wonderfull game with hours of entertainment! LOVE this game. From my opinion one of the best in th total war series. Sale?:BUY No sale?:BUY
2921	1	a	It has its flaws like some texture glitches and historical flaws (if you that much of a stickler), But who cares about glitches when you can cheat using esf editor and make the most powerful country on your first turn then invade russia in the winter and have massive sea and land battles with great multi player battles it is fun to actually play a 4v4. It is also one of the better total war games. They always talk about stuff like how 'were working on graphics' I think that empire total war has the second best graphics in the total war series.
2923	1	a	It is the ultimate game for the strategist at heart!
2925	1	a	Empire Total War is a classic for me. I love the time period it's in and if you like total war games, this is the one you can get.
2927	1	a	638 hours playing this game, something must be good about it
2929	1	a	Epic fighting on battlefields from Russia to Cuba. Fight to create America or rule the world with an iron fist... or mabye a musket.
2931	1	a	This game deserves praising!
2933	1	a	very very good campagin and sea battles land batlles could be better but over all a great game
2935	1	a	This game is great to starty out with to learn about Stratagy. Since its quite basic and its also very fun, it also teaches you money mangement of your empire so you will quickly defeat you enemys with economics and your Armys Strength. How ever the Naval in this game is quite strange but it can be fun with other players.
2937	1	a	It is so fun and it is not to laggy You can do alot in it and is quite interesting
2939	1	a	The closest you can come to world domination.
2941	1	a	Really love the game, personally would love an update to do co-op campaign that would be my only complaint everything else seems manageable.
2943	1	a	Fun world domination. Once the wars get old or slow, just overwhelm and auto resolve combat. Take a weak nation, and eventually own all of Europe, the Americas, Noarth Africa, Middle East, Russia, and India. Lots of infrastructure upgrades. Making allies, keeping them, dealing with enemies, and the killing allies is what this game is about. Diplomacy, War, Nation Building, and Strategy. Great all around, until you finally beat it, or take over most of the world. After that, it sits in your libraru untouched like most other games.
2945	1	a	This game is an absolute must have! Combining this game with great mods like Darth Mod or Minor Factions makes this game an incredible experience. This has got to be my favourite Total War game.
2947	1	a	By far the best total war since the original. Huge scale, big improvments to unit fighting and the time period of the units works well with this style of game play. It's much less...involved than the all melee ones. You're not constantly reogranizing formations or chasing units all over the map.
2949	1	a	Build your own world spanning Empire and may the sun never set on it!
2951	1	a	Empire is a classic, at its current state, a great game. Though not perfect, it captures the 1700's century brilliantly with musket warfare and the wave of Colonization. Fun for history gamers and RTS fans
2953	1	a	Amazing! Truthfully the best game i have ever played!
2955	1	a	This game is very fun to play if your one who likes to control armys and many other things. The online is also really fun with the sea battles land and siege battles you can team up with up to 3 of your friends to play together and use team work to win or be a lone wolf! i definitly would recommend this.
2957	1	a	great installation in the Total War line of games. lots or replay value and great graphics
2959	1	a	Epic game, I can only recommend
2961	1	a	Go to war like a sir.
2963	1	a	After putting in a few days worth of my life into this game over the past few weeks I feel slightly more qualified to write a review now. This is the second Total War game I've played, I put a few hundred hours into Medieval II so I won't be comparing it to any other TW games.   Campaign Mode: 8/10 Battle Mode: 7/10  Naval Battle: 8/10  Land Battle: 6/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 Multiplayer: 5/10 Overall: 8/10 I would definitely recommend buying this if you’re a fan of strategy games however I would wait until it’s on sale simply because of how damn buggy it was. I had my first save game corrupted after about 50 turns and after that I had numerous crashes and bugs. The AI was pretty brutal on the campaign map but almost laughably easy to fight against in battle modes, there were numerous times where I could fight off armies numerous times larger than my own simply by letting them charge and eat my canister shot.  
2965	1	a	To me, this was the best in the Total War series until we got to a few games after. No matter what they say about the issues, it allowed me to go and conquer the world. And I personally love the 18th Century style warfare.
2967	1	a	An amazing turned based strategy game with a mixture of real time combat. Taking place in 1700's Europe, you take the role as one of the major empires of the period. Make your choice, and rewrite the course of history! If you enjoy managing an empire, while being a field general leading your nation to glory, then this game is for you!
2969	1	a	It make good play game many hour having funs.
2971	1	a	This game is actually hard and tactical, I like that. 9/10
2973	1	a	Empire Total War is the best Total War game out there. In Shogun 2 and Rome 2 sure the graphics are better, but there is only one map in those games. In Empire there are three campaign maps in one. America, Europe and India. It is also good because there are a lot of diverse nations to play as. I was able to conquer the world twice, that shows how much I love this game.
2975	1	a	Very Great Game.
2977	1	a	This is a very good entertaining stratergy game and is personaly one of my favourates. It is extremely entertaining and the battles you fight are excelent. They are not laggy and run smoothly and it is also alot of fun to command an army!. There are many different things you can do on this game and it is up to you how you choose to build your empire and because of this every time you replay empire total war it is just as enjoyable as the first time you played it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of stratergy games and i would personaly rate it 9/10.
2979	1	a	I don't ever write reviews for games because most of you all do the job for me. But I have to at least write one line for this game. It's definitely worth investing 5 bucks in! BA game, BOOM SHACKALACKA
2981	1	a	I like this game ... 9/10   + artilery + strong cavalry  -sometimes stupid AI
2983	1	a	Download the DarthMod and be happy :)
2985	1	a	The gameplay is fun, the visuals are GREAT (if you have a good computer), the sounds are realistic, and it is historically accurate. I would reccomend this. 9/10
2987	1	a	Good game if your into history/city managment, with darthmod it's allot better, i'd reccomend napoleon over this for multiplayer (There's no coop campaign in Empire) though Empire has a larger map.
2989	1	a	i really do like this game i just wish we could easily mod it (legally) 
2991	1	a	it is a very fun game if u ask me. i have not had it for very long but when i got it i have just still all day playing it.
2993	1	a	Nice game, it is more better if Sega put Napoleon TW and Empire TW into one game
2995	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time. Has an excellant campaign and units. A few small problems that arent really very noticeable and a load of mods. This game is fantastic and a must buy for anyone who likes military history, history, strategy games or the TW series. Excellant game and a job well done.
2997	1	a	Great game and one of my personal favourites in the Total War Franchise. I'd just wished they'd add a co-op campaign.   8/10
2999	1	a	Basically an awsome game, with interesting twerks and (through mods) immense replayability, with the cons of god-awful graphics and the burden of being utterly abandoned by the developers.  I give it a strong 6/10 just because of the loyal community

3003	1	a	'Raise high the regimental ensign, my children! No prisoners! No pity! I will shoot any man I see with pity in him.'  Lieutenant-General Sir Bosque - shortly before his death at the Battle of Marseille.   10/10.
3005	1	a	Not the best total war in term of battle, but the map design is great and the city management is good to. I had fun playing this game and conquering UK with the Indiens.

3015	1	a	Played as Poland-Lithuania  Took Over the entirety of Europe  Taxed everybody like a crazed dictator and watched as my population plummet from starvation  Watched as my entire empire fall apart into many smaller nations  10/10 Would be Hitler again
3017	1	a	My dog played a game against a complete n00b and still won the battle 9000/101
3019	1	a	After coquering the entire known world through military and diplomatic means, converting myself to a Republic, controling everytrade route, and making every city happy under my rule...Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 34th Grand Protector of the Republic of Great Britain and her colonies...sat down and managed taxes for the rest of eternity.  9.9999/10  Would unite the world agianst the threat of China only to find that China is non existent again. 
3021	1	a	great great great.. the trade theatres brings an amazing new level to the game that makes having a navy fleet or two worth having for other than just defending your shore or ports.. but keep up with ever advancing naval technologies or your trade theatre claims may become contested rather quick.
3023	1	a	*Played Road to Independence, and fought off the British *While killing the British the United Provinces declare war on France and Me *5 turns later United Provinces take France *2 turns later Spain declares war on United Provinces and takes over France *3 turns later My army is fighting the United Provinces in Europe *5 turns later I wiped them out *10 turns later Sweden is at war with Russia and destroying them *5 turns later I become somewhat like the UN and march on Sweden *2 turns later Sweden declares war on Denmark and takes their capitol *10 turns later I take Denmark's capitol back and gives it back to Denmark *2 turns later Denmark declares war on me because I am allied with Spain and the Cherokee are allied with Denmark and Spain attacks the Cherokee *5 turns later Denmark sends an army to America and takes over Boston  10/10 Would be attacked by Denmark again
3025	1	a	Fantastic infantry/cavalry/artillery/naval programming, I throughrougly enjoyed the grand campaign multiple times, and playing custom battles on both land and sea. Sadly the enemy AI appears quite basic, either you can run rings around them, or they relentlessly attack. The game is plagued by small bugs and glitches left in. It's heartbreaking because so many look fixable, as if SEGA just forced Creative Assembly to make 'Napoleon: Total War' rather than fix 'Empire: Total War'. This leaves Empire as a flawed experience. The worst issue seems to be a memory leak, reducing frame rates massively. This doesn't stop Empire from being a playable game massive in scope, and owning a big reputation.
3027	1	a	the game that got me on steam; decent game, but possibly one of the worst (warscape-era) Total War games (maybe even The worst); still, I give it a thumb up for sake of nostalgia (also because, welp, the game isn't that bad at all, it's just... very average, especially when compared to some of the other TW games, even the other warscape ones)
3029	1	a	Empire is a brilliant addition to the total war collection, love the battles over the seas :)
3031	1	a	Absolutley Great Game, the strategy, the Maps, it acutally teaches you how to read a European Map, Amazing game. Prussia is the Best Faction
3033	1	a	invaded Russia in Winter as Prussia, took it. Roughly 200 years later  Russia: 'who's laughing now'.
3035	1	a	Absolutely fun! This game is very instructive, but this is very hard, too, especially at the beginning. But when you learn how to play, you can't practically stop playing.  Campaign is very entertaining and interesting. You can choose empire from year 1700, and do whatever you want. You can raid trade routes, wage war against other countries and conquer them. You can develop new technology, make massive army/navy and upgarde buildings like farms, for examble.  You can play Battle, too. This mode is only for battles against CPU or other players. You can develop your tactics in war and get the great feeling of massive victory.  I recommend this game for players who are interested in Strategy games. This is elite of Total War -series and all Strategy games. Price of this game is suitable. If you like Strategy, you can play this practically 100+ hrs, so 19,99 € isn't big price. And if you are interested in, buy all DLCs. They are so cool and make this game even better. Thank you for reading, hope this helped you if you weren't sure, do you buy this or not! 4,5/5
3037	1	a	Man what to say about this game. It's another of this Total War series masterpiece... This game teached me to love Imperieal warfare era. It's a old game that I still play nowadays. Also it's sucessor Napoleon is a great game but this game offers some great mods and different timeline(playstyle). I recommend it a lot, and if you are taking a hate for CA about them being a DLC ♥♥♥♥♥ it's your profit for buying and playing ther older games especially now they are cheap.  The only problem would be the not so great Campaign AI. But to fix that there are a lot of mods. I really recomend DarthMOD empire. Makes the game much more realistic/historical and really hard.  Overall 9/10
3039	1	a	I've read some terrible reviews of this game- people saying that it's the low point in the series, but I loved it. I thought the theatres of operations idea was great, as were the naval battles. Trade is more important than ever and Allies ACTUALLY HELP YOU. Plus, economic and social development are fun, especially with the town system.  But...  The game doesn't really offer you a challenge. In rome on hard difficulty, everyone attacks you. On this- nope. The AI tactics are broken or non-existent, predictable and easy. Besides, the map looks horrible compared to rome. Also, the ottoman troops are automatically worse than the europeans. Besides, I don't like the fact that all the american indians and the mughals are locked out in campaign.  Overall- fun but not the best of all the TW games.
3041	1	a	The year is 1721. I am commaning Sweden on a quest to unite the Baltic coast under one flag. I have already crushed Courland, Denmark, and Poland-Lithuania, and Prussia will soon fall. The government is as strong as ever, and with skilled generals at my side, nobody in Europe can stop me! Then, the Russians try and provoke a war by stationing troops near my border. But, their confidence will be their downfall. With my influence stretching from the most remote Norwegian peaks to the fields of Bohemia, I am a true empire!  10/10 best strategy game I have ever played.
3043	1	a	10/10 Would send elephants on militia again.
3045	1	a	Love it! Great tactics! Conquered the world under Great Brittan in 70turns and made 120k a turn without cheats. Love the artillery and Light Infantry, Only better total war game is Rome II
3047	1	a	Being my first Total War game, I love the RTS aspects of this game, but is best shown in the actual skirmish battles on land, I mean sea is fun but somewhat confusing with intricate controls. The scale of battles with hundreds of troops under your command is amazing, playing it on PC is really addicting but now that I find that it is available on Mac I question the decision to lessen troops in each unit group. I mean really from 120 units in a group to 40? That is just strange to me and I hope that the Mac version can live up to the Windows version.
3049	1	a	How to play as Russia:  Spawn in as Russia Invade Finland almost instantly Turn to a Communist Dictatorship even though it 1700 &lt;NEXT TURN&gt; Break historical time line Make Austria and Poland-Lithuania ACTUALLY become friends. Recruit 999+ Cossacks Take a break from the game and drink vodka Come back to play game &lt;NEXT TURN&gt; Invade Sweden and Denmark Start rebellion called 'Vodka White Army' Turn back to a Russian Monarchy Make time machine Time back to the beginning of the game.  Congratulations, you be granted a I.D Card to Russian Hell! 
3051	1	a	It like the castle game. Big army, but no stabby stabby, shoot with big gun this time. Have elephants. Ships too. Not a shamerfur display though, that comes later
3053	1	a	Mother Russia doesn't want peace with me :(
3055	1	a	When you play campaign:  Yes! you finally conquered the place you have been stacking troops and agents for days!, wait what is that? the ally of that enemy has sent three of his generals and their highly trained army after you, well guess what? THATS WHY YOU SHOUD'VE HAD ALLIES INSTEAD OF REJECTING SOME NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE YOU JERK!!! To put in a sentence, For this game, plan ahead............whether you have a mass army and a higher advantage, or a poor army and unstable cities, they will find you, and its never safe in Total War.
3057	1	a	  F*** naval battles other that gg
3059	1	a	I really spent so much hours in playing Empire: Total War because of it's much more realistic economy system than any other Total War Game (and I love realistic economy systems). Not only through colonization you have many options for trade with expensive goods (like coffee, tea, sugar) with other colonist nations, you also can try to push up or down the price on the world market to enhance your situation. You also have minor cities with different prosperity levels besides your provincial capitals where you can focus on factories or (if it is a poor city) on curches to improve religious integrity or even brothels for a satisfied population. You may also build Universities to research technologies faster to get a positive distance to your neighbour states. All in all, Empire: Total War is a really good game and today you get it mostly for 10€ or below. I can recommend it to everybody who likes games that combine real time battles with turn-based management on a campaign map!
3061	1	a	Do you like horses?  Do you like Muskets that take forever to reload?  Do you like cutting down an entire unit of infantry with a cannon ball?  Do you like burning down London for what they've done to Earth in the past?  Do you like what-if scenarios?  Do you like making friends with countries, only to stab them in the back 2 in-game years later?  If you answered yes to any of these questions... YOU'RE A SICK F***!  But no worries, because we have just the game for you. it's called Empire: Total War.  Here, you can change the course of history, in various ways, like saving the Natives from the Europeans, or turning the Prussia into a Super-Power. Reasearch technology, build your army, and dominate the world.  But most of all, you can march into Russia, during the winter time. SUCK IT NAPOLEON AND HITLER!  Total control is in your hands... if you're smart, if you're not, you're gonna get steam-rolled, srry... Not srry.  17\14 -LANESLASH
3063	1	a	Great Game, Plenty of Mod Capability, Fun, and Epic. Perfect to see if you want to know if you have the Military Cunning to Conquer the Globe in under a Century with 18th Century Technology.
3065	1	a	Empire Total War is one of the best games I have ever played. You can play this game in many ways like a Civization game with the campagin map but. It was A LOT of replay value since if you choose to play as a different nation they have comepletley different play styles, units, and diplomecy which makes two play throughs of Grand Campagin completley different. In combat however is where it really shines. The strategy is SO in depth about how to deploy your units, when to deploy your units, and what formation is extremly fun. It is also EXTREMLY detailed as you can zoom in and clearly see your units individually and watch them fight. My favorite part is to look after a big battle at the battlefield where you can look at all of the bodies bc they dont despawn and you can see where they were deployed and how bloody was the combat it is amazing, However the diplomecy can be annoying with the AI and they are kinda dumb but all is forgiven if you choose to go on hard and play the battles yourseld because that is where the focus is.   If you are new to the series this is one of the most realistic RTS games out there. I have seen on the Military History Channel a show called Deceisive Battles I believe it was called and they used Rome: Total War to simulate the battles with amazing accuracy. This game came out later than it 
3067	1	a	excellent game, best of all total wars
3069	1	a	Great game, great graphics, great histrical acuarce, great game. Good for people how like stratgy
3071	1	a	If you like seeing thousands of men in one army completly killing with another army of thousands of men, this is your game. A great turn based strategy along with real time playing. This game sparked my interest in the Total War series, and is and was a great starter for the series
3073	1	a	very adictive game , awesome with darthmod
3075	1	a	Wide spanning campaign. If you are willing to forgive the average AI, you'll spend a lot of time forging your empire, and destroying others'
3077	1	a	GET IT, be sure to get darthmod with it.
3079	1	a	I love all Total war :)
3081	1	a	Amazing game! A must have!
3083	1	a	best game ever if you sre looking for a stragity game thisi is the one and hope they make a empire total war 2 
3085	1	a	Great strategy game; still having fun after years of replay.
3087	1	a	Just four words: I Love This Game!!!!!!
3089	1	a	This is a good strategy game it has a lot of factions, good graphics, and awsoem gameplay
3091	1	a	Contender for my favorite game of all-time, as well as one of the best strategy games in recent memory.  I've been playing TW games since the first Shogun, so I can honestly say it's the most diverse, comprehensive &amp; immersive TW made.  The only thing I was hesitant about were the naval battles, but I soon found out that their steep learning curve was WELL worth it. Every battle could potentially be Hollwood-caliber fare.   If you think the idea of taking a nation and blazing a path of glory through the three main theaters of the world, (North America, Europe &amp; India), is appealing, go for it.  Instant buy.  NOTE: I suggest you get Darthmod Empire for an even better, more realistic experience. 
3093	1	a	Good game Ai is stupid which bugs me and needed more variety in nations and more historically accurate troops. 
3095	1	a	If your a fan of depth, intrigue and tactical expertise this is it. DAMN AMAZING&gt; The field and sea battles are very good, flexible and always fun. Graphicallly exellent, especially with troop count at max. You might even learn a few things from the poignat qoutes from the rich and crazy over the years, to little known obscure events through the period 1700- onwards. Great Great Great. CoD lovers need not apply. Please, dont even think about it.
3097	1	a	This game is interesting. I love the Total War series in general. I have been a huge fan of them for several years now. This game is good and bad in multiple ways. It has a lot of interesting history to it and a great play through. The command interface is rather simple too. The downside is that the game frequently will crash if you don't have a super computer. I give this game a 6/10.
3099	1	a	the battles on this game are really fun, and the campaign is interesting. you can play different countries, with different units to switch things up. downside is that multiplayer doesn't include a strategy mode, so no long campaign against your little brother in a different state, just have to settle for beating him in a battle instead of completely ruining his empire
3101	1	a	My god, I have played this game more than I like to admit but it has all been worth it. Great period, HUGE campaign map, tons of political, technological, and strategic ways to map your conquest. While the vanilla version is good, it isn't great. Get one of the many mods that rebalance everything and make it more fun/innovative once you get bored.  Get it, mod it, love it.
3103	1	a	This edition of the Total War series is a very fun game. Empire has come a very long way since its more than disastrous release (not as bad as Rome 2). The game has a very fun campaign experience, good factions, and very good units at your disposal. The battles are always a good time, except when a AI unit gets glitched out, or when they, or even sometimes your units have a hard time trying to find a pathway to where you want them to go. The DLC's are very nice to have, but if you aren't interested in spending money to be using units like the US Marines, or Legion of The United States, or you are not interested in playing as the Native Americans in the campaign then the DLC's may not be for you. All in all, the game is a 8/10 for being a fun RTS, having a great campaign map, as well as having great units and factions, but The Dumb AI can really hurt the game for me, or even other players like yourself. 
3105	1	a	This game is one of the greatest games ever. I love the Total War franchise. Their is so much to do and love. Prussia is my personal fave.  One problem, countries like Russia, Mughals and couple of others are really boring to play as. Russia is to undeveloped (while historically acurate) this can be annoying and difficult, Moscow and Kiev are really your only regions to think off. And talk about an underpowered military. But if you can put in the hard work and patience Russia and Mughals can become absoulte monsters.   I sent my bears all over Europe, crushing all the eagles and lions.
3107	1	a	I have always been fascinated with the Revolutionary War. Infact it is my favorite thing. This is a great game for all strategy and Revolutionary War fans!
3109	1	a	Probably my favorite Total War game
3111	1	a	one of my best games
3113	1	a	This a great game for all you stratigic fighters !!!
3115	1	a	Its killing me now Best strategy game ever Highly recommend  I have been an RTS fan since early on, played all the great names from Command &amp; Conquer to Wh40k: Dawn of War. Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan. Starting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air..... The game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army. You can join your friends and fight bots, do 1v1, or a large scale battle of up to 6 players 3v3.
3117	1	a	Epic game play, never seen a game with so much battle strategy and formation technique in all the games ive ever played i could play this game over and over again to find a new end result or a new thing that i havent experienced in the game before. i recommend this game to any and all video game generals whos is ready for amazing battle scenes!
3119	1	a	Cool Game!
3121	1	a	One of the best Total Wars, with tons of big mods and best of all the first TW to get a multiplayer campaign!
3123	1	a	8/10 
3125	1	a	so fun nothing to say its just fun
3127	1	a	One of my all time favorite games, besides Battlefield 2. I've been playing this since it came out, took a break, but now back at it. Just can't get enough. Highly recommend.
3129	1	a	Many total war players don't like this game because they complain that it's too easy and buggy as hell, but I like it because its the only one where the naval combat actually works.... and I like ships. If you are going to play this game 'Darth Mod' is a must
3131	1	a	This is a really good game. There are lots of glicths and bugs and some stupid mechanics. But the battles are amazing and the campain really good.
3133	1	a	for 20 bucks its well worth the caps. ive had it for a few years i always come back. every battle is different. you can play as most of the major countries all around the world. awesome online play anff great graphics for the time
3135	1	a	this game if for those player who like empire building over combat. if you wnat a blance of combat and empire building get medival 2 or if yoour want total war style combat get rome. this game is heavily influenced by policy and empire managing. a major new featuresthe best diplonacy system eve rmade for a total war, towns have been introducted to effect your reigions as they grow and what you can build, technolligy is now controllable instead of a fixed time date and naval battles are in play. this and the last 2 major titles are wha tmake shogun 2 and shogun fall of the samurai the most balanced games in the series. because i havent actually played shogun i can't review it yet.
3137	1	a	Empire: Total War was the first Strategy game I've played. I saw the game and said 'Hmm, looks cool'. I downloaded the demo, and spended about a day, playing each mission.  Then i bought the game. It was amazing. Commanding my first empire was a blast, conquering Indian Tribes, and sailing to the Americas, discovering new lands. The AI wasn't the best, so I took a break and downloaded Darth Mod.  Then, I jumped back straight onto the game with Darthmod UC. Then I started my 2nd Empire. I realized how better it was, and much more challenging. I kept Darthmod, because it improved graphics, and AI. Then I got used to the game. I decided to begin a bigger Empire with much more enemies. I started focusing on Economy and it really helped. I got trade and towns up. I got so much money, that I made a huge army. I felt so good.  Thats when the colonies decided to declare independance. I got pretty mad, so I discovered I could have relations. Know I knew alot of the game. I was ready.  I sailed with my allies to the new Americas. There, the war with the Rebels lasted 3 Years in-game. I had a blast battling. I gave some land to my allies in the Americas to avoid rebels. I took the Americas back for myself then. After I had conquered most of the Americas, I decided to move into uncharted land and waters. I found tribes, and made allies, and made new enemies. I was amazed by the game. I conquered many new lands, and made many enemies.  My empire became power hungry, and I fell apart. I was so happy, and I enjoyed myself. Just next time, hope to lead a more successful empire.  If your looking for a game like this, buy it. The AI is not the best, but there are mods that fix the game. The modding community makes some cool things  Rating 9.8/10  AWESOME GAME!
3139	1	a	ETW is indeed quite an old game however it is one of the best in my opinon in the Total war seris with tons of factions and darthmod does inhance your game quite alot but it is still an awesome game even without mods.
3141	1	a	Realy good game...get it today!
3143	1	a	A VERY detailed game, much like risk.  Takes a long time to play through a game.  But it would take a long time to seige, not only a country,or contenant, but the world. Schools, scholars, assassins, captains are a 'detail' to the game that allows users and cpus to give their training, navy, or offense that little extra boost.   I found most of my time trying to figure out ways to maximize income. Not the most exciting part of the game.  This game makes the users truley in command of the terrirory, armies and navies that you own. There is a battle feature that fights for you if you find your massive force against an army or navy the size of a bug. Another feature this game has is not only the ability to hire a number of different units, but build fortresses and defend in buildings.  One of my favourite parts of this game is how you can disperse your army during battle. You can set their formation to be a square, or a rectangularish shape, depending your situation in game. Watching each and every person in a unit fight in this game is Very entertaining. Especially if you are having a massive amount of cavailary run stright into militia.  Good game. I can only play so much of it though.
3145	1	a	one of the best RTS's i have played
3147	1	a	Good Game, Fun with and without mods :D
3149	1	a	Played vanilla for about 200 hours, came to the conclusion it was pretty sh*te, then decided to download Darthmod and it was suddenly the best game ever!   Starting a new campaign always feels new and refreshing, never gets boring.  MP is a no-go area, mostly deserted, if you happen to find someone it's usually rocket ship spam or something similar.  10/10 though!    And yes, I'm still upset about Rome 2..
3151	1	a	Good as balls.
3153	1	a	It really is a great game, the only dissapointment is the ai in seige battes  4.5/5 Stars
3155	1	a	Take over the world and laugh as your enemies are destroyed by your superior technology and troops. I managed to complete 'World Domination' starting as France, so you can win with basically any nation. My personal favorite thing to do was to send over 1000 troops to take out roughly 180 musket-armed citizens. Overkill at its best. Basically, world domination, needless slaughter, and diplomatic control over the people you didn't attack... yet. What's not to like?
3157	1	a	Having sunken many hours into this game on many PC's, I can definitely reccomend ETW. The gameplay is extremely good, in both the grand strategy and RTS environments, and while I do feel that NTW does many thing better when it comes the RTS elements, I prefer Empire for it's setting and mods, which make a good game exeptional.  My choice of mods are -  Darthmod - A mod which includes hundreds of tweaks to make the game more realistic and challenging. AUM - The additional units mod by SwissHalberdier, adding many new units which massively boosted my enjoyment of the game.
3159	1	a	Perfect for people liking strategy games ..  You can either play at land or sea or play one of the campaigns and take back city near where you live ! you can also play siege game modes where you either are attacker or defender as defender you defend the castle and attackers must take it by climbing up ladders at the forts walls or by pushing in the doors.
3161	1	a	Beast game to play with friends and its all so very fun to play by yourself but i reccomend that you get all the DLC's for the best possible game
3163	1	a	You cant be denmark. But you can be sweden?   Disapointed..  Anyway 10/10 :D
3165	1	a	You know a lot of people poop on this game for the ai but i think this is in fact one of my most favorite strategy games. heck it was like my first steam game its a great casual game that has like no learning curve and anyone can jump right in. perfect for everyone
3167	1	a	one of the best total war games ever
3169	1	a	I can say without a doubt that this is a good game. While remaining unbiased, I will include that it does have bugs and there are areas where features could have and should have been included. I give the vanilla game 6/10 and the Darthmod version w/ the AUM mod an easy 8/10. If you loved Command and Conquer then this one is a must own.
3171	1	a	Great addition to the Total War archive. Had lots of fun leading the Revolutionary War. Most factions howerver are limited to only ranged units, and do not focus on hand to hand combat. 8/10
3173	1	a	Not the Best Start to a Total War Game, but it's a really good one.
3175	1	a	if you enjoy history around 1700-1800 get this game. Sweden and ottoman empire is a little OP in multi-player but you can find a weakness in every faction. Poland is a cool faction to play with in the grand campaign and of course Britain and France have the most to do. England is the best to play with on the hardest difficulty because you have to fight on 3 fronts.
3177	1	a	Super game, HUGE campaign map, although it should have at least had 1 native American faction, but there is still more then enough to do. It has all the thing you would get in all of the earlier games.
3179	1	a	Even for my pc the game is pretty heavy but the game is very fun to play with quite nice graphics and decent gameplay. The multiplayer is dead though.
3181	1	a	It's different than other TW games, but it's a refreshing change. Guns don't make the game less exciting, as some argue; instead, they require a change of tactics. Playing in the colonial era can actually be quite fun.  The graphics are an improvement, though they aren't great, but in this kind of game, I prefer gameplay over visuals. The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century.  A few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn. The game came out very unfinished, but it's been polished up and is now defnitely worth buying for any TW fan.
3183	1	a	After playing 1678 Hours of this game, I can say it has faults.  Ottoman Empire bug and the lack of formation lock can make the game frustrating. However the tension created when your army starts to lose and you struggle to fight with only one cannon and a few half strength units is palable and if you acheive victory the elation is real. Excellent Game made better by community mods by Darth MOD and Bran Mc Bom.
3185	1	a	It's ight.
3187	1	a	Probably one of the best RTS games i've ever played (along with just about any other total war title). There are also plenty of mods available if you should get bored of the vanilla game but lets face it, that is'nt gonna ♥♥♥♥ing happen. 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games. gr8 m8 i r8 8/8.
3189	1	a	Amzing game wait for it to go on sale tho last sale it was only a dollar
3191	1	a	Awesome game, I defiently reccomend you buy it :D
3193	1	a	Pretty damn mint game. This is only so I get the Badge
3195	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played 
3197	1	a	10/10 Would play forever
3199	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played
3201	1	a	In my top 5 most played game of all time. This game is great. I'd recommend for anyone.
3203	1	a	Its so fun controllng you own army.
3205	1	a	The best game i ever palyed in my life i love the battles and sieges
3207	1	a	Best strategy game on the market
3209	1	a	great game 
3211	1	a	The ♥♥♥♥ing sickest strategy game ever. Got both turn based and real time. RT battles are ♥♥♥♥n amazing to watch and play out.
3213	1	a	As a long time fan of the Total War series, I have to say this is my favourite. This and Medieval II are the ones in the series one can replay the most &amp; still enjoy the game as if it were the first time playing. If you're a fan of strategy games &amp; are looking for a good game to get you going or you're already a veteran at strategy games &amp; want another challenge, Empire: Total War is for you!
3215	1	a	Great game. I have played quite a lot of this game over the years and i have throughly enjoyed myself and still do, i always end up coming back to this game time and time again. The theatre system really helps to make your empire feel huge as it stretches several continents. The combat can get a bit boring at times when your troops just stand there exchanging fire but there is much more strategical depth to it then that. The variation of units isn't bad and with the DLC and mods there is a lot of unique units. I feel that this game has a lot of replayablity because every campaign is different and there are soo many different ways you can approach empire building, there is also a lot of depth into unit research which add new formations and equipment to you units which can change the way you play. This is one of my favorite games of all time, i definetly recommend this game if you have enjoyed any of the other total war games. But if you have played napoleon total war you might find some things lacking like having client states and less ship variation but having theatres really makes up for it in my opinion.
3217	1	a	Great game *IF* you have Darthmod, as Darthmod turns this game into a great game with intelligent ai, realistic sounds/ effects, realistic unit ranges etc; however, if one does not wish to bother with mods at all, then i would skip this game and move to a diffrent total war title.
3219	1	a	Get some tea and Crumpets...ah What the hell freakin' buy this game!
3221	1	a	Best game of the total war series. It is more complex but it is more realistic in my opinion. Worth 20 dollars!
3223	1	a	This game has given me many hours of entertainment! Fantastic mods, beautfiful maps.
3225	1	a	For a great high graphic strategy game with resounding multiplayer and an excellent single player campaign. This game is Amazing!!!!!
3227	1	a	It's really good game!
3229	1	a	Yeah, get it if its cheap. Decent Game.
3231	1	a	Empire Total War + DarthMod = best game
3233	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!
3235	1	a	the best game in his category ever... the first and best of naval battles...a massive campaign map....an extraordinary battle graphic machine...BestGame 2009'2010
3237	1	a	For the Republic!
3239	1	a	This game's campaign is super good!!!!!!
3241	1	a	THIS IS AWESOME!!! 
3243	1	a	Empire TW is by far the best Real Time Statergy game I've ever played. This game is so sharp when it comes to historical accuracy. The battles and campaigns are exceptionally superb. This game will bring to test your mind as you try to out think and out class your rivals on the continents of Europe and the Americas aswell as the Indian Sub-Continent. Your capabilities as a general in the heat of battle will also be tested, as you fight the huge mass armies of your enemy. This game also has a broad variety of mods aswell, so you'll get bored of play this game. Empire TW is completely sandbox and so you are free to wage war with anyone at anytime. I highly recommend this game!
178	0	a	Tried to go back to this game and it's a bit buggy and does not explain information in a clean way. The Overworld UI is terrible as well making you go hunting for small buildings that are not mapped.
3245	1	a	Great strategy game Sean Bean approved
3247	1	a	I have entered the point in my life where i just want Total War and Civilization to make sweet love in the form of making a game with combat like total war and the ability to advance through the ages of technology like Civ then like me play till my heart explodes thats all i ask. But..... Pro: its total war you will love it or you're wrong playing as britain makes half of europe hate you so you end up owning half of europe to stay alive fun looks good I'm too lazy to examine it further than that just watch gameplay on youtube who reads this stuff anyway Cons: I never get fighter jets :(
3249	1	a	just a perfect game it has som faults but it's still one of the best games I have'    I just wish you could play as Denmark and USA  I also would like if you could build consentration camps in Russia and get rid of them all hehe 
3251	1	a	Although I am not incrediably far in the game yet, I really like the game so far. It's very fun to play battles that you create personally or the campaign. It's got a lot of good content and great gameplay overall. I would reccomend this to anyone.
3253	1	a	empire total war is a cool and fun game where you fight nations and grow and conquer , the game is awesome the battle on land is amazing fun and stratigic with alot of replayability , however the thing that is most disappointing about the game is that sea battles are not fluid and fun , the reason i bought the game because i thought it is the best age of sail game but its not what i expected but it is playable and you might like it
3255	1	a	Empire total war is like a sickly child (no offence to anyone who might have one). Of course, it's your baby and you love it, but it's just not... there, you know? Empire, even to this day, lacks polish (not the country, dangit) and there are still some absolutely ridiculous undertakings by the AI, most of which we'll get to later. But how about the pros and cons of the Vanilla game, shall we?   PROS -excellent representation of 18th century warfare -the emergence of nations, such as Greece, USA and Scotland (among others) is interesting and mixes the campaign up -you may now contest in 3 theatres: America, India and Europe -The campaign map is pretty, has lots of cool features such as towns that magically spring out of the ground, and a realistic intercept feature, meaning you can't just trot by an enemy army without implications -Graphics are still ok, despite it's age -Naval battles are a very welcome introduction, and they're pulled of qute well. -Interesting tech tree -Fantastic new trading system on the campaign map  CONS -Battle AI can be gamebreaking -AI diplomacy is all over the place -Melee combat is an absolute snoozefest, and infantry charging is all sorts of broken, glitchy and weird -18th century warfare means little in unique units within the same culture. All european armies will end up looking the same, just as all native american armies are just as similar -With so much emphasis on the navy and trade, naval battles can become very frequent and very repetitive, especially in local trade theatres and against pirates -Autoresolving is broken. You can have a 1500 army come up against 80 rebel swordmen and lose 300 men. How?  If you do get this game, i highly recommend DarthMod. I'm not gonna bother with the links etc. but it's definately worth a look see. The battles in Empire are underwhelming, especially with the poor AI, decision making and lack of bloodthirsty action, but DarthMod does a great job at reparing a few glaring problems as well as adding new features not only to battles, but the campaign as well.   The broken AI means i give this game an overall 6/10. The campaign map is the best it's ever been, but in battle, it's lackluster.  With DarthMod however, this bumbs it up to 8/10 level. Makes battles and campaign far more engaging.
3257	1	a	If only multiplayer campaigns.
3259	1	a	One of the best Total War games in my opinion. Great period, Large map and a decent variety of units.
3261	1	a	i have had alot of fun with this game in the campain you can choose from a number of nations from the early 1700s like spain and great britain then you advance that country and try to dominate the world it is like a civilization game but with amazing stratigical battles where you have to use tactics to win or you can just have a quick battle against a PC of friend   i strongly recommend this game
3263	1	a	Fantastic and immersive gameplay. I recommend playing with the mod 'Darthmod Ultimate Commander Platinum' for the most challenging and rewarding experience.
3265	1	a	Ai more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than a rock
3267	1	a	This stuff is good man
3269	1	a	Empire: Total War is amasterpiece of the total war series, it was my first game on steam and i still play to this day. 420/10
3271	1	a	I played this game when it's free for a weekend but I bought Napoleon however. Still I'm looking forward to see Empire 2
3273	1	a	very good game, i would sincerely recommend this! some lag but easily fixed, Campaign map is awesome! AI is good, 9/10 stars!
3275	1	a	Lately this game isnt wanting to work for me and several of my friends. I would recommend it though. Great game. Instant classic
3277	1	a	So far it has been my most played game on steam and the reason for that is the Empire: total war is one of the best strategy games I have ever played.
3279	1	a	Empire Total War is the best strategy game to this day. Graphics, gameplay ect. Beats all the previous strategy games before it and it beats the shogun total war series. Can't wait to see if Rome II Total War will be the next best strategy. If you like strategy, then this is the Game for you.
3281	1	a	Game Rocks.
3283	1	a	My favourite Total War™ game so far.
3285	1	a	If you like history and you like an indept strategie game than is this something for you!!
3287	1	a	$3.75 was a steal !!buy it now or regret !!
3289	1	a	One of the Most Realistic strategy games of all time. This game has everything from large scale battles to skirmishes to massed cavalry assaults. Empire Total war is a must buy along with its successor: Napoleon total war and its predecessors: Medieval and rome total war.
3291	1	a	All i can say is this: WAY WAY WAY BETTER THEN NTW, THIS GAME ROCKS (except for creative assembly's racism towards muslim factions,mainly The Ottoman Turks) but overall get THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!
3293	1	a	Best new features in the serise hands down. That makes the game more fun.
3295	1	a	Best strategy game behind minesweeper.
3297	1	a	Decided its probably time to give E:TW a review considering I played this for lord knows how many hours on disc before I ended up getting it on Steam.  So, is it any good? Short answer...Yeah.  Pros: -Empire offers the biggest map (to my knowledge) out of most of the Total War games. Ranging from the Americas (North, the neighbouring islands, the head of South), Europe/North Africa, some of the middle east and India. There are also ship-only trade locations around indochina, africa and the americas which also add to the fun. -Loads of factions. -Even more emerging factions (All hail the might Norway which completely throttled my Russian Empire). -Nice range of units even without the DLC. -The Era itself is quite fun, this is the closest to a World War Total War game so its worth getting to try the vanilla version before getting the World War One mod. -Revolutions give you the chance to revolt..more importantly the chance to change your nations flag color (Sorry Maratha, it sucks though.)  Cons: -The diplomacy system..it just doesn't work. For example, Playing as Spain and all is going swell, offer trade with Persia. The game freezes for a moment and I wished it had of stayed frozen. Upon unfreezing, Persia demands 4 of my cities and offers 5 turns of military access....Why in the ♥♥♥♥ would I want to send troops to Persia? -Copy Pasted villages. All the towns seem to look way too similar, I mean atleast in the American countryside the forests look different but other then that, it's like the Devs just kinda gave up. -Stupid Units. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. STUPID. Seriously, the amount of times my troops shoot their own soldiers, run back and forward when ordered to charge or just REFUSE to walk into a building is irritating. -Rebellions. I mean, im a veteran at the Total War games, having played almost every one but I have to say, the rebellions in this seem more like the game going 'Meh, why not?' than logical 'tax is too high' or 'religious unrest' rebellions that happen in other games. I've had cities on low tax, religious building with preachers, no schools or colleges and nice pleasure gardens and even had both low and high amounts of troops...rebellions just seem to happen for no reason and they can really mess you up.  I'd give the vanilla game a 5/10, it's not a bad game but it has its flaws that can almost derail any pros.  WITH mods, game bumps up to a 7/10 Still recommend getting it though maybe wait for a sale.
3299	1	a	The 13 colonies will rise again.
3301	1	a	This is a great game if you are looking to rule the world if it is Playing singleplayer or with Friends this is a great game over all if you like games like Risk. My rate form 1/10 Would be a 8 1/2 
3303	1	a	Beat it with my eyes closed before installing. Beat that!
3305	1	a	love the game, need to make more countries player acessable like portugal and i would love to see a empire total war 2
3307	1	a	Just awsome
3309	1	a	Great strategy game, easy to jump in and just start playing. Dont really care for the naval battles but that is a small part of the game.
3311	1	a	What I like about this game is that you can turn history on your own imagination. I annhialated Austria, massacred Poland, bombarded sweden like there was no tomorrow, and currently in the process of invading America.  Sadly, all of them was done offline.  10/10
3313	1	a	Great Strategy game with First time Naval Wars.
3315	1	a	This is for players that love Army control over the battle field. And its RTS which is awesome. If you've got a good computer the graphic are amazing!
3317	1	a	I recommend this game
3319	1	a	It is nice game about 1700 century. I love battles, World map. Only bad side in this game is bad AI and FPS drop in massive fortress battles.
3321	1	a	The British Are Coming!
3323	1	a	One of my all time favorite games, this got me into the total war series and i havent looked back since and now own all of them, Brilliant RTS with line infantry, cannons and so much more to keep you occupied for hours. 9/10
3325	1	a	Tried the demo and really liked it. Bought the game and am playing the hell out of it. Cant believe i missed this one for so long. Great Game!!
3327	1	a	ah yeah good crack,gets little boring after a while but still thumbs up
3329	1	a	Huge game. Love playing for hours (and hours and hours)
3331	1	a	Good game. easily worth the $3.74 on sale offer.
3333	1	a	After playing Medievel Total War 2 for a long time, this really blew me away. Initial release was a buggy affair (not as bad as most modern releases), but true to form, CA fixed the game. Any tactics you learnt from earlier TW games, chuck them out off the window - rifles, cannon and lightning fast calvary are the main flavours. Long range muskets suffer poor accuracy, but like in 'ZULU', wait until you see the white in their eyes and open fire - devastating to numbers and morale. Naval battles are a hit and miss, but again you have to read naval tactics from that era - rake your cannon fire as you pass their broadsides and stern. Can be satisfying if you reduce their sailor numbers and capture a heavy flagship.  A great addition to any TW fan's collection.
3335	1	a	10/10
3337	1	a	If you are a fan of RTS games, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. Definitely worth the price!
3339	1	a	If u like line warfare this is the game for u  10/10
3341	1	a	I was never a fan of the Total War series but the videos of all those ridiculously huge battles was always something I loved. After being tempted and pushed to try this title by one of my friends, I decided to sit down and give it a go. And I love it. Micromanaging an Empire, building up Units and conquering lands along with huge battles and drawn out sequences make this a tactician's wet dream. This is the first Total War game that I have ever played and sat down thoroughly with.  I am not disappointed.   On the other hand, I was informed by many that [Darthmod] improves the game substantially, so I have never truly experienced the 'Vanilla' version of the game (one which is untouched by mods and 3rd party fixes). I love Darthmod and ETW, both compliment one another and with the whole new addition of extra units and better A.I. this really vamps up the game as a whole. See the end of the review for more links on where to download Darthmod.  I do, however, admit that ETW does suffer from its fair share of bugs and broken game issues but do not let that detract you from buying this. It's a great title. I have purchased all the DLC for the game too and the extra units are *very* much worth it. Heck, even game changing!   A great title, yet sometimes awkward to play due to strange A.I. behaviour and crashes due to... well, we all know that Total War games since Empire are buggy and unfixed.  Overall score: 8/10 (it'd be a lot lower without the mods I've added :p)   Darthmod v.8.0 on ModDB .  I would highly suggest you download this mod via Torrent! It's a lot faster and easier to obtain, I find ModDB's speeds too slow. Be sure to seed back to atleast 90% for everyone else who wants the mod too!
3343	1	a	Beautiful! The best game so far :)
3345	1	a	The rustics were so inept, it nearly took the honor out of victory  nearly.
3347	1	a	Great game. I would highly recommeds it.
3349	1	a	yes because it is nice game and im a nice dog so there you go i am shibe i is doge
3351	1	a	Hey guys, Im a big Total war fan, take it from me this is the best game in their collection in my eyes. It offers the all round greatest features of a total war game, but plays across 3 theatres and introduces naval battles into gameplay. Along with a personalization of technologies and growth of your nation. Only downside is there is a max of 10 or so nations to choose from. My rating is a 9 outta 10 and a must have for the Stradegy gamer!!!
3353	1	a	its really good but if you play it to long you get bord of it
3355	1	a	Awesome game! Gunpower warfare in a RTS works so very well!
3357	1	a	overall I give this game 3 stars.  the battle aspect of the game is good, but the diplomacy and the governents need alot of work. The thing I dislike the most is the fact that random nations that you have never heard of constantly attack you with boatloads of men in some random location EVERY TURN. But overall a good game
3359	1	a	I made Austria declare war on germany, my army got slaughtered, so i went home and bought this game and had a lot of fun. 8/10 
3361	1	a	I love the campaign map its the best in the Total war series in my opinion.
3363	1	a	One of the better Total War games I've played... Started my Total War experience with Medieval Total War, then to Rome, Medieval II, Empire, Shogun 2 and Rome II... All great games, for me I would have to place this game at #2 to Medieval II Total War... Tons of content and story and endless hours or pure entertainment... I haven't even tried any of the mods yet but I'll get there when I start to feel the game is lacking as for now it's been years and they are all great games. Good luck, Happy Hunting...
3365	1	a	I love the total war series! I am not really interested in the campaign for this game. I soley bought this game to play instan action for the USA during the revolutionary war era and i was not disappointed i am a big fan of RTS games and i enjoyed this game.   9/10
3367	1	a	Started up 1st game of 2016 played as prussia -went to war with poland -rekt warsaw in 2 turns - went to war with hannover after being besties because they wouldnt give me denmark -reking hannover as we speak 11/10 would rek poland again
3369	1	a	Sad to say but this game isn't that great. Mainly because of the AI, in a game were alliances and diplomacy are so essential, you'd think the AI would be great. Its the complete opposite. Allies won't help at all, city states that are allied to you at the start of the game drag you into wars with super powers you can't possibly win and if you break the alliance you lose ALL your allies, and everyone will hate you and go to war with you. Another thing, navies. Navies are very key to the game (as you can imagine) but sadly its very very hard to build one. You start off with no navy to speak of, while other countries (Spain, France) have many fleets. You can try to build a navy, but before its big enough another nation will come along and destroy it. Finally my last issue is up keep of armies. The game is called Total War for a good reason, you are always at war on multiple fronts (which is annoying as you have to put all your money into war and you can't improve your nation). Which means you will need multiple armies, which is hard at the start because your allies wont help and you will get bankrupt, your troops will leave you and you will get overrun. I have played this game alot (I got the game on a disk before I got it on steam hence the measly two hours on record) and have won world domination on hard difficulty. This game is playable but it will be one miserable ride. However this some moments can be quite good, like when thousands of your cavalry charge down those damn rebels. And when you look over whole continents that belong to you. And when you finally crush filthy France and Spain for constantly hindering your progress. There are good moments and the tears, pain and self harm make it worth it. So maybe you should give it a go. I'm just some kid with too much time on my hands what do I know.  Final Verdict: 7/10
3371	1	a	This is what happens when you give a bunch of history nerds a stupid amount of money. Great going, SEGA, because Africa wasn't starving or killing itself slowly from the inside in the most socially decisive and destructive way possible or anything. Selfish ♥♥♥♥s.  Fantastically produced bla bla bla yadayada! Graphics are as about as impressive as this rotting half eaten Snickers bar hidden under my bed. I can see it now. Nope. Still not impressed. Combat is extremely pointless. Why fight when there is a ♥♥♥♥ing 'Resolve Battle' button. Seriously SEGA, you dropped the ball on this one. Instead of pouring millions into a luke warm awful combat system, EXPAND ON THE 'Resolve Battle' BUTTON. Seriously. DROWN THAT ♥♥♥♥ IN DLC. I want flashy buttons, themed buttons, buttons with Christmas lights dangling off it around Christams time (and Jew lights for whatever the Jew holiday is). Dialogue consists of drinking tea and screaming from a fatal musket shot to your scrotum. Campaign is boring.  My advice: Kill yourself.  You ♥♥♥♥.
3373	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. Definetly the best in the series.
3375	1	a	Epic game! One of my favorites of all time.
3377	1	a	If you are a fan of the TW series this will be a good adition to your library.
3379	1	a	Total War's first foray into an age other than one of swords and bows, Empire, like much of this franchise, is a flawed gem. Being their first real go with armies that predominatly use guns, the AI work is sloppy and it really shows. It's pathetic how easy it is to expoit the AI's failings in battle and win yourself crushing victories that you shouldn't have gotten. It's also the first shot at naval combat, which functionally works better but still seems to generate complaints. Personally I blame that on a lack of knowledge about how to use warships in the age of sail in a fight more than anything else (hint: cut the enemy's battle line). Lastly, the diplomatic AI has a rather predictable habit of delivering you unpredictable war declarations. For example I was minding my own business as the French carving up North America for myself when I got war declared on me by the Marathas (India). Before too long they were landing armies in the Carribean and harassing my trade fleets. Why? I still have no idea, but it sure didn't help them when I dropped my huge armies fresh from American conquest into India. But damn was that war annoying when it started.  So what's the good? The map is -huge-, and the number of choices for nations to play is considerable (Though most are European). In other words... replay value is in abundance here. And that's really all it needs, to be honest. A game like this is made for being replayed and ending up in various differing situations. And it is here that this game shines. Otherwise it's a mixed bag.  What i'm trying to say is that this game is pretty decent, but you might not want this to be the first game in the series you try. It might sour your opinion and lead you to not looking into the other, arguably better or at least less flawed, entries into the series. But, this does have huge replay value. You will get alot of playtime out of this. If that's what you are looking for, then that might be all you need to have the pros of this game outweigh its problems.
3381	1	a	Brilliant addition to the total wars series. I like the tech tree which flows with this era, naval combat that was added and the most important classic total war land battles... awesome!
3383	1	a	worth my time 
3385	1	a	this is a great game while others are graphiclly supirior it is a great game and definatly worth the buy you can fight naitives in the americas slaughter europe wreck the middle east conqer north africa and bomb india lots of gameplay and an ok amount of factions 9/10
3387	1	a	Britain best ♥♥♥♥er Merica ♥♥♥♥er Frunch and ♥♥♥♥ OTTO
3389	1	a	Excellent game, It makes you wanna learn about 18th century Europe!
3391	1	a	This is the Shiznit!
3393	1	a	Great game!
3395	1	a	Dominate the high seas or as a revolutionary government bring Empires to its knees, or fight for control of North America and the European colonies 10/10.
3397	1	a	I absolutely love this game, who would not want to take over the Americas? who would not want to watch Russia take over India? who would not want to help the maratha confederacy take over the world? Who would not want to have the chance to kill some Frence? Who would not want the chance to make trade partners for Britain?   So many possibilities, it is a endless game that no one can say is boring, i loved this game more than i liked shogun 2 and napoleon total war put together ( probally because i do not like those ones ).   An example of how good this game is: When i was Austria i thought expanding into the ottoman empire would be the best possibility. However i needed to expand into Germany a little first to secure my poistion. When i invaded Prussia my good friend poland- lithuania went to the aid of the Prussians and declared war on me, I did not want to take their lands however so i soon amde a peace treaty with them. Once i had taken the settlement i wanted i tried to make peace with the Prussians, they did refuse so i was forced to continue my war. However i soon realized they was not going to go through the poland - lithuania territory to get me, so i moved further into Germany territory. but soon i was stabbed in the back by the polish ( just they do now to us English ) I was forced to raise more armies to deal with tem, this caused tention between me and my western allies. Once poland- lithuania was mine i had to invade my allies, this made more friction between me and Britain, my second best friend. Then before i got the chance to Invade the Ottoman empire ( my original plan ) The spanish declared that my monarch was not the true blood to my throne ( my kind had died leaving a Queen in charge of a country - Oh no! ) I soon invaded alsace and lorraine and paris. once they were mine i payed for a peace treaty with Spain, due to them being widespread i didn't want to wait to build strong navies. By this point Britain was nervous of my power and did not like me, even though they were still my allies. And the ottoman empire i wanted to invade loved me completely.   This shows just how much the game can change over the time you play, adding to the complexity of the whole game. I know that during my European wars Britain was taking over the thirteen colonies and at war with france and spain. This made Britain more of a threat to me, since they now had a average sized amount of land in the Americas, and nce they fell in Erope i would have another potential threat over in the Americas.    The guns also are brilliant to use! I often just make a army of cheap line infantry just so i can let the enemy come towards me, their cavelry always dies shortly after. My cannons ( 1 to 2 units ) always lower enemy moral before they get into my range of fire for my infantry. Then the cavelry ( 1 to 2 units ) always cover the flanks and kill the runaways at the end of the battle.    Over all i can say that i really recomend this game and that anyone who does not agree that this is a brilliant game should go back to it and reconsider their choice.   Sorry about this being a overly long review by the way, i hope that no one has gotten bored reading it.   for anyone wanting to know more of these battle stories please join my group, t is dedicated to the total war series, we have player of the week and regular announcements and discussions. the discussions are about which faction we use in what games and more while the announcements are for planning a multiplayer campaign in advance. I believe that anyone interested in the total war series should join my group, 17 members currently ( 28 / 2 / 14 ).   Yours Sincerly Giaus Julius Ceasar
3399	1	a	Very good game, easy to play with pleasing visuals and UI/GUI. Can't wait for another.
3401	1	a	Some good ♥♥♥♥, definatly decent mods for it too if you get bored of murdering turks and ♥♥♥♥♥s.   who knew, turns out p0laks is a slur
3403	1	a	Great strategy game. love it.
3405	1	a	Love it - love the whole total war series!!
3407	1	a	it's the beast game of TW after Napoleon
3409	1	a	destroyed France immediatley 11/10
3411	1	a	It is rather amusing to watch volley after volley of bullets mow down your enemies.  I LOVED Empire. But i see why critics called this a failure. I have recently brought Napoleon and even though it's not as fun and i don't play it as much. It has ALOT more content and worth than Empire.  6/10  Buy Napoleon instead or Get this if you are into the American Revolution instead.
3413	1	a	barnsy is love they say barnsy is life
3415	1	a	Conquered the USA, then got defeated from some territories by some natives with axes...  10/10, would lose to a primitive force after destroying a future super power again.
3417	1	a	Just install darthmod and you should be fine.
3419	1	a	Joe Fraiser would play this game!!!!
3421	1	a	Empire Total War™ begins in 1700 AD, the age of musket and cannon and exploration. What’s special about Empire Total War™, it now features three large maps and four small maps; the large maps show ‘America’, ‘Europe’ and ‘India’, the small maps contain the locations: ‘Brazil’, ‘S.W. Africa’, ‘Madagascar’ and around the ‘Java Sea’. Like all Total War™ games, the series consists of different nations that reside in the continents the games are based, but now you can experience playing as new nations or factions that the series has not featured before (In the ‘America’ and ‘India’ maps): the ‘Maratha Confederacy’ (India), ‘Mughal Empire’ (India), ‘Cherokee Nations’ (America), ‘Pueblo Nations’ (America) and much, much more.  The game features special events that occurred within the century it’s based (The Thirteen Colonies, the French Revolution, the beginning of the United States of America etc…), the game now features a ‘Technology Tree’, it provides improvements and upgrades of buildings in all different professions (Agriculture, Industry, Military etc…); the game also features politics, whether you’re a republic or a monarch nation, you can choose or change any minister of the cabinet who you do or don’t like, or swap two ministers from their possession on the cabinet. Like Medieval Total War™ to Rome Total War™, there were many changes made within the graphics, system of the campaigns, movement of the soldiers and the intelligence of different nations, like the big change from those games, Empire Total War™ was the next jump after Medieval II Total War™.  This game stands out to me personally because of the generation it’s based: The different continents it features and the unique soldiers it contains; the time of the red jackets, Imperial conquest, nation expansion around the New Colonies and in the far east; also learning, enlightenment, culture and industry. The game now has a new way to how the soldiers move and fight (bayonet or sword), instead of moving a regiment of infantry or cavalry though a forest and getting stuck around the trees, Empire now doesn’t have that problem, and if one unit of that regiment gets stuck or falls behind, the soldier will catch up. On the campaign map, you can now move multiple armies, navies or agents all at once instead of moving them one at a time. You can now trade in the small map regions but you must avoid pirates from attacking your ships. You must also be careful on taxing or cultural differences on places you take over, constant oppression can lead to strikes, riots and rebellions. This game to me is 10 out of 10, it marks the time of enlightenment, discovery and exploration within the colonies.
3423	1	a	Really great game! It includes all the powerful empires from the 1700-1800 era
3425	1	a	It certainly is a very fun game, but taks a lot of time and dedication IMO. Easy settings you can roll over the world, the others are very pasisve. Higher difficulties though are challanging enough to be fun.   I recommend this to every strategy game/history enthusiast.
3427	1	a	From time to time, I still find myself coming back to Empire Total War. I just love the naval battles. =)
3429	1	a	This game is an awesome strategy game that allows the player to control his/her own army. It requires deep thinking an strategic moving or just rushing the enemy, the choice is yours. However the fact that this games multiplayer is not suited towards Mac users greatly angers me and I think that the developers should introduce a cross over for multiplayer for both Macs and PC's.
3431	1	a	battle of the imperials - one of the best games
3433	1	a	One of the best strategy games you'll ever play.  I played this offline quite a lot, and honestly I keep returning to it as I discover more and more little tips and tricks to get ahead. It's a little Empress-wannabes dream.
3435	1	a	This is a truely amazing game. Lots of great gameplay which can be repeated again and again and again. Throughly recommend to anyone.
3437	1	a	Well, the only reason why I am still playing whole Total War games are battles. But these are in vanilla just terrible, so it is almost unplayable without some good mod(personally preferring DarthMod). Things about how bad campaigns in those games really are, are better to be unspoken. At least DarthMod campaign is bit better but of course it just can't smooth all mistakes made in vanilla. So I would not recommend this without mod but if you look at some of their newer games, you will understand that this game was their golden age. Thumb up!
3439	1	a	If you are a fan of the brittish colonial wars and that sort of stuff THEN I HIHGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!!. if you are a fan of stradegy games THEN I HIHGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!!!. AND THAT SORT OF STUFF. if you do not ike fighting dont buy this game k my faviourite contry is England.. The game has a geat campaing and very good graphics just a little bit worse than rome total war 2. I GIVE THIS GAME 10/10 !!! BUY THIS GAME
3441	1	a	When it comes to replayability this is the most replayable game in the total war series. It has 3 continents and 4 trading regions.  When it comes to battles this offers a lot of different units ( meele infantry, ranged infantry, meele cavalry, ranged cavalry, elephants, cannons, mortars, rockets, grenades ) and a lot of sea units ( small ships, galeys, frigates, heavy ships of the line, rocket ships, steam ships). And a lot of sieges ( open towns, artillery forts, star forts). When it comes to campaing it offers military, diplomacy, economics and sabotage. What more do you want?! 10/10 would steamroll the world again XD  PS: If you want more hardcore gameplay, download 'Darthmod'.
3443	1	a	Best total war game, best depth and content. Makes subsiquent games look simplistic and limited.  The closest thing to it is the EU games, and even those dont have the same level of depth immersion as Empire does.  If you havent played it and like total war games, make sure you give it a try.
3445	1	a	Amazing game that definitely makes you think. Perfect for RTS fans
3447	1	a	Fun game with great mods
3449	1	a	Greatest game ever! Especially with Darthmod 8.01 Platinum!
3451	1	a	best game ever if you have a brain
3453	1	a	Empire: Total War nice
3455	1	a	I love this game that much when my original CD breaks, I installed this version from steam.  
3457	1	a	This game was my first Total War experience, and I must say, I was quite lost at the start of my journey. The grand strategy and RTS genres were probably the ones I had the least experience with, but playing around with this for 340+ hours was both an enlightening and rewarding experience. Even though this game is old and outdated by todays standards, that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying. I have completed around five grand campaigns, and as expected, are very similar to one another. The three 'superpowers' of the time period (Britain, France and Spain) are the only factions that have missions, one for each of them. The game does little to encourage more playtime apart from these three faction specfic missions and the initial goals of conquering a set amount of regions, making the mid-game quite tedious. One thing that needs to be addressed (and probably never will be by CA) is the fact that the Maratha Confederacy is ridiculously unbalenced. I've seen them field between 10-15 armies (a few of them full stacks) just in one region. I'm not sure if they're supposed to act as an invasionary force much like the Chaos Warriors in the newly released Total War: Warhammer, but if they are, it hasn't been done right. I've noticed that the aggressiveness of the Confederacy may be due to a patch made by CA due to complaints about factions not being offensive enough and is frequently mentioned in old posts found on the Total War Forums for this game.  Apart from this, the battles are entertaining and sometimes (perhaps rarely) even challenging, depending on the troops you field (to this day, I still haven't mastered Cavalry units). The siege variant of these battle can be boring, unless you take the fight straight to the enemy, unlike the historical methods of these situations. Sea battles are initially confusing, but are actually quite simple and easy to master. I recall that there is a guide someone wrote regarding this.   Overall, the game stands as a great acheivement and a welcome first step into the world of the RTS and grand strategy. It may trip over its own feet at times, but the entertainment value found in the game is ultimately up to the player.  Edit: Also, the Warpath Campaign is hard for the Iroquois, and the Austrian Army barely stands a chance against the Prussians from the get go. Very-Hard difficulty is insane, and combat bonuses for the enemy are ridiculous. Keep it to normal or if you want a challenge, hard for decent enjoyment.
3459	1	a	After playing this game for a few hours I rate it as one the the greatest real time strategy games of all time. Equally fun if you take a hands off approach to your battles and rely on the auto resolve funstion or take control against insermountable odds and use keen strategic placement of your troups along will real time battle manuevers to outflank and crush your foes.   Varying nations have different bonuses and starting situations. A multitude of possible alliances and backstabs are possible and achieveable by various means. Placate your population with religion, sorted diversions or military presence or victories. Utilize the same to dominate a conquered populace and/or turn them in time to your loyal followers. Infiltrate opposing countries with spies, assasinate or sabatoge as you go. Send out religious emisaries to turn populations to the one true religion. Train researchers to bolster your war technology or steal/trade it from another country.   The Grand Campaign is amongst the best offered in any strategy game and was probably the best at the time the game was released. So many factions to conquer. So many alternative routes to take to world domination. Replayability is off the charts.
3461	1	a	There is no game that i've played so much for so long, just so awesome!
3463	1	a	Great total war game, always find myself coming back to it. Was a mess when first released but with the patches and some good mods this game can be excellent. Definitely recommend.
3465	1	a	There is no game that i've played so much for so long, just so awesome!
3467	1	a	Great total war game, always find myself coming back to it. Was a mess when first released but with the patches and some good mods this game can be excellent. Definitely recommend.
3469	1	a	This game is not as good as FOTS but it is still pretty good. The patches they have been releasing for years has definitely made the game much better (though it is still prone to glitches) I had a lot of strategic fun with this game and it can go toe to toe with Shogun 2 in some aspects.   If you want a more modern experience though, go with Shogun 2 FOTS. Unless if you think the 18th century is more interesting and you like line infantry combat more. Even though there is line infantry in FOTS it is a lot faster paced than in empire. ETW is a lot more like its time period.
3471	1	a	Love this game and tactics involved in battles!!
3473	1	a	This game is so epic.
3475	1	a	If you have played all or most of the Total war games, you will see that this game is 100% perfect ..  The only problem i can honestly find about this game is the Electric bill !   
3477	1	a	This game is fantastic. The strategy aspect is pure genius and there is no possible way to make this game easy. Until you get the hang of it, it will be a great challenge.  UPDATE: 11/25/16 Game is still fantastic. That is all.
3479	1	a	Be sweden Take Norway Riot starts in norway Ignore riot to get Russia Full army in russia and no defense in sweden Riot ruins my game 10/10
3481	1	a	One of the best Total War titles! Totally beats the older ones, it brings a LOT of new features compared to them and that are the new standard on Total War series, including Naopleon and Shogun 2. Nothing but a kick ♥♥♥ game!
3483	1	a	There are negatives to this game but so many more positives, it's may Fav of the total war series and I hope that they make EMPIRE 2, it's been a long time waiting.
3485	1	a	There are negatives to this game but so many more positives, it's may Fav of the total war series and I hope that they make EMPIRE 2, it's been a long time waiting.
3487	1	a	Well very hard to win for me even on easy but have to admit spent many hours playing this game.
3489	1	a	Nice game, extraordinary war simulation battles and great recreation on units. I recomend this game to anyone that likes strategy games based on history.
3491	1	a	I bought this title for the extra content rather than Napoleon. I looked over the flaws of this game. I really enjoy it. MULTIPLAYER PLAYERBASE IS STILL HUGE 155+ DAILY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT. Not even kidding. DLC's are worth it in my opinion. Get them on sale before it ends on Jan. 2 Play with me on mp. I'm better than average. BUY THIS GAME YOU WONT REGRET. Mods for this are awesome I swear.
3493	1	a	So after playing almost 50 hrs or so, I can honestly say this game is awesome. worth at full price.
3495	1	a	big epic battles this is what i love about total war
3497	1	a	Anyone who likes TW games, buy it!!
3499	1	a	This has become my favorite Total War game. No doubt it has many flaws (the least of which are technical issues, which really hamper the game at times). But IMO, with the correct Mods (i.e. Darthmod) this game is the largest in scope and really gives you the sense of controlling a world wide empire.   What makes this game so enjoyable for me is the incredible amount of variance in play throughs. Your campaign as Great Britain or The United Provinces, which sees a lot of overseas expansion, is likely going to be very different than a campaign as Austria or one of the Indian factions, which are much more land locked. Of course, you can always mix it up and change history by taking over Europe as the Ottoman Empire, then invade and conquer the Americas.   The actual battles are great as well, and again with the right mods they can actually be a challenge. t is very fun to assault an enemy position or to use the terrain to make a strong defensive position and repel enemy attacks. I think the graphics and animations during battles are superb, even if more recent titles like Shogun 2 have improvements.   As I mentioned this is my favorite Total War game, and will likely remain so as Rome 2 is a mess and I just can't bring myself to play it.
3501	1	a	Two words: Darth Mod
3503	1	a	meeh it's fine
3505	1	a	I haven't played a RTS styled game since Red Alert on PlayStation, for some reason they don't draw me in as much as FPS or RPG's do. But I thought I'd give it a go. This game is one of the most addictive games I probably have ever played. At first the amount of depth that's in the game seems overwheling but before you know it you are worrying about the econmy and politics. This game just blows my mind. I reckond that everyone gives it a go.
3507	1	a	I love it :D
3509	1	a	Barely have internet actual time in game would be close to 50 hours  Start as Austria Research industrial technologies Build economy  Lower taxes get good farms Fortify Collect money Fortify even more Collect money trade trade trade trade Poland and Prussia go to war Russia and Sweden go to war Russia and Ottoman empire go to war Maratha confederacy rises Become allies with Bavaria and Venice Fund saxony in thier fight against Prussia Collect money get rich research military stuff because I have 3 schools Spain takes on portugal Fund Portugal and give tech Take Morocco  Portugal puts up long fight Spain weekend United provences allies with surrounding nations to take on France and Prussia Fund Sweden Fund United Provences Fund Bavia Fund Italian states Fund Mughal empire King dies and Spain declares war Take Naples and build it up. Massive income by 1753 Takes Spain Fund Russia wait collect loads of gold France surrenders Takes most native American nations Fund Sweden Sweden, Russia and the Ottoman empire are busy at war Take central Europe Take Middle east Maratha confediracy falls Russia weekend take poland by 1768 Bavaria being a mass economical super power takes sweden through Denmark,  Bavaira and unprenouncable nation next to them help me fight of the Mughal empire was tough fight New spain become independant. French colonies revolt. by 1772 the 13 colonies have a hard time controling the war in the americas. Just managed to keep Russia under control and Persia and Mughal empire drove me out of the middle east  raise taxes back up to normal level  172.4/10 would lower taxes again  Barely have internet actual time in game would be close to 50 hours
3511	1	a	This Game is always really fun!!
3513	1	a	Empire Total War is far the best out of the series in my opinion. I mean not the vanilla,but with the DarthMod you can reach every undeveloped part of the game which is very nice itself,but overall this,you will have a free expansion for the game.By this i mean you will be able to play with the minor factions which are in the vanilla game but you can't acces to it.How cool is to conquer the whole game world with buccaneers? Cool,isn't it?..So if i didn't conviced you yet watch videos of the game you're going to be ....This is my best game EVER! (If you'd like to play online battles with me feel free to send a friend request) 
3515	1	a	Buy this game. Seriously... Have spent hours enjoying this game, and it never gets old.
3517	1	a	i love this game
3519	1	a	best total war
3521	1	a	Flawed but absolutely brilliant.
3523	1	a	Like it or hate it, comparing it to other Total War games won't cut it. In the grand scheme of things, Empire is still one of the cream of the crop in strategy. Although sometimes the AI is wonky and graphics and bugs are issues, there is still the noteworthy Total War franchise gameplay we know and cherish combined with one of the richest and most 'civilized' violent eras in human history. The way that Empire let's you play is no longer a jumble of bodies running over each other, it's a skillful game of chess. Much like the time period, the rules of war are clearer and more strategic. This may not be the best Total War game, yet it still ranks high on my strategy list. 9/10
3525	1	a	Amazing Game one of the best of the Franchise
3527	1	a	I think its a fun and very addictive game all though people are negative about it i think its a game that you should get. Its a good total war starter. I give it 5 stars
3529	1	a	 www.ilovemenandthisgame.♥♥♥ 
3531	1	a	2600+ hours played 10/10 would fail freshmen year again
3533	1	a	I spent a long time looking at this ame and not playing it. I actually owned it, I just didn't expect much of it. They I went back and read my Sharpe collection, the books. Thought to myself, I need a game with muskets. 'Oh, what about that game?'.  Playe it for like ten straight hours. Thisgame handles OVERALL difficulty well. Each nation you can choose poses different threats and challenges. This is very important in a campaign central RTS. The diplomacy is stupid. The battlefield Ai, pretty stupid. But when it works, the game is fantastic. For each flaw there are ten qualities.  And some of the best naval battle simulation I've ever seen.  Oh, and its that brutally honest kind of game where sometimes, at the very start of the battle, a cannonball bounce high up in the air, comes right down on your general and kills him. And then your mighty army slowly backs away.
3535	1	a	This game is a great game. It will never get 'too old'! Its very uniqe. You can play all from epic naval battles, to nice land battles. I recommend this game if you like Age of Empires and other games like that. If you wan't pay the current price, maby it will be on sale on Steams SummerSale.   6/6 stars from here. ******. 
3537	1	a	Great game... this was my first total war game i ever played and its just so amazing. You can literally do anything and change history with it. The only thing i dont like about it is that the A.I. is not the best as it was.. ;) but with darthmod or ACW mod its awsome even with vanilla. Ive had 390 hours with this game and im very impressed. I even took over the world with malta on hard level. Its just a great game and i would reccomend this game to the world.  9/10  Great game!!
3539	1	a	best game of total war serias !
3541	1	a	The only and best line battle simulator on the Steam store :P  Variety of factions to play from including five Native Tribes: Iriquois, Pueblo, Cherokee, Plains, and Huron Wyndot. Not to mention the fierce Ottoman Empire   Authentic and detailed naval battles and simulation for those classic wooden, sail, and cannon warships used in the 18th century  Active multiplayer community  Plenty of interesting and relevant quotes in the loading screens; loading screens are beautiful too  Graphics still hold up for a 2009 game   Though, the AI runs away constantly in the Warpath campaign, and siege battles become redundant as the AI won't utilize the walls. Also note, some people like to spam artillery and light dragoons and light infantry, resulting in hit and run  Recommend at base price or bundles that include all the DLC
3543	1	a	I put way too many hours into this game before I discovered Napoleon Total War and I haven't played it since.

3547	1	a	Despite its age Empire is one of the best total war games ever  10/10
3549	1	a	I love this game. It introduced me to the Total War series and I am keen to try others. Both naval and land battles are very nice and fun to play. The game has many pros and cons, just like any other.   - Pros  -Large scale battles -Graphics aren't too outdated -The game is historically accurate -Great roleplay value -Great replay value -Large choice of nations to be in the campaign -Some great mods out there -Realistic  - Cons  -Sometimes stupid ai, the men sometimes just stand there while the enemy is in range, getting slaughtered -Not very friendly to new players of Total War -Micromanaging cities in the campaign is annoying  Overall, Empire: Total War is a great game and I am planning on buying Napoleon (because people say it's better).
3551	1	a	Better than napolean?
3553	1	a	Maybe, the one of the best strategy and same time fun game!
3555	1	a	GREAT game! Campaigns are perfect as is the free world 'Grand Campaign'.... Multiplayer is a bit unbalanced and buggy but all up a great game from the best in the bizz, the Total War gang! 4/5
3557	1	a	entertaining game, the graphics are good, but i wish they added more variety to the unit's appearance, most of them looked the same. And i also wished that the battles were more intense, as sometimes, units would just stand and do nothing... game is filled with some bugs, glitches, many things could have been improved but other than that it's a great game and i recommend it!
3559	1	a	Definately one of the better titles in this series.
180	0	a	Great gameplay, cool units, etc. The Total War Saga -including Empire- is absolutely awesome, on paper. BUT then you find out that between so much offering DLC's, Sega has done absolutely nothing about fixing the constant crashes in all their games. It happens in Empire, Napoleon, Shogun, Rome II (NOT gonna buy Warhammer, sorry). When some of the people in your team are incapable of some decent coding and you don't replace them after a couple of buggy games, the bottom line is that you only care about making a few quick bucks.
3561	1	a	Easily my favourite Total War game. There's bad parts to it of course, however that does stop that satisfying feeling of watching Swedish line infantry slaughter Russian troops.
3563	1	a	Roma Victor!  Oh wait... It's 1700!   Rule Britannia!!!  
3565	1	a	This review is mainly concerning multiplayer. I have played Empire, Medieval 2, and Napoleon. I played the demo of Rome 2.  Three reasons why Empire is the best TW game that I have played: 1. I find the gunpowder warfare far more interesting strategically than the tactics of other TW games. 2. Compared to Napoleon, the nations in empire are more balanced. Personally I prefer the micro mechanics of Empire and how there is a clearer view of the battle. 3. In its current state, the game has relatively few flaws compared to when it was released.  *I have not played Shogun 2 so I am not able to compare Empire to it.
3567	1	a	Great game. Lovely ship battles
181	0	a	Great idea, rubbish AI, diplomacy poor, duelling cut sequences broken, battles pointless as too easy to beat computer
3569	1	a	-playing as Poland-Lituania -Prussia invades my protectorate, Saxony -declare war, bring Austria into the frae -Prussias allies with the Ottomans, -Ottomans attack Austria -Great Britain declares war on the Ottomans -The French help the Ottomans -the Dutch fight the French -The Swedes invade Denmark -Russia invades Sweden -Spain attacks Russia -results in a devestating war all over a small country 10/10 would recomend
3571	1	a	If this game was a carrot, It would be a very good carrot.
3573	1	a	It was crap when it came out, but after darth mod, game was perfect!
3575	1	a	Great game
3577	1	a	This game has by far the best economic system of the Total War series, and you know why? NO DAMN SQUALOR! Unlike the Rome games, it meshes your military and civil fronts together as simply as possible. Not enough money, fire some soldiers! Town looks like it's about to rebel and shove a bayonet up your ♥♥♥♥? Fill it with troops! I'm no historian, but the battles seem to get the basics right. Running 3 miles in full combat gear's gonna tucker you out, Swordsmen are better at giving close range 'hugs' than snipers, and farmers are gonna panic when Terry next door is turned into a shrapnel pincushion. Trust me. I'm a the Broiest of all generals.
3579	1	a	best total war game yet!!!
3581	1	a	Awesome Game you can easyly Squish those fools
3583	1	a	Start game Pick Russia Conquer Turkey 10/10 realism

I backstab polad-lutiuania 100 turns later russia owns europe. 5 turns in revolution happens. 2 turns destroys revolution  10/10 russia stronk
3587	1	a	Favorite total war in my opinion, and I have Rome 2 and Shogun 2 also. First of all, the game feels so smooth compared to the other total wars, especially if u dont have the best computer, and theres even a Road to Independence mode. The mode features the colonists in Jamestown the first chapter, and slowly progresses to the making of the declaration of Independence in the third chapter. Now to a few bad things, THIS GAME IS OLD so it does not have the BEST graphics and does not have more than 20 matches going on at a time in multiplayer. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (In all total war games) so they pretty much just all charge u at once unless u put the difficulty on expert. And in my opinion, the worst aspect of the game, THE TIME LIMIT! Grand Campaign and Road to Independence have a time limit, forcing you in the wonderfully brilliant campaign, to hurry up. OVERALL. the game is nice and fun, but does have a few problems which could easily be fixed, but wont be because the game is old.   P.S. idgaf about the grammar mistakes bruh because i dont  P.P.S. I know i didnt put a period at the end of my sentence there. That was to show i really dont GAF. P.P.P.S. or P.P.S.S. (I dont know) 10/10 IGN would free America again.
3589	1	a	There are two things that I am honestly obsessed with: genocide of native peoples as a result of european colonialism, and Tim Gunn's guide to style. This game satifies both urges.
3591	1	a	Excellent game. Unlimited replayability.
3593	1	a	My 24 pounder frigate destroyed 6 Sotl. 10/10 completely accurate.
3595	1	a	I bet the brits didnt like the campaign...
3597	1	a	Yo this game is nice af doods. Good campaign, and good historical accuracy. 19/14.63 would buy again. (Plus all these nerds who wouldn't recommend this game have like 1 hour, and they don't know what they are talking about xD)
3599	1	a	i play gaem wit friend and it es a good gaem me friend and other friend play gaems togetheer and he say gem is gud so i by an play and i say et es gud to you should geett dis gaem.
3601	1	a	The British army was weak. It's last city still standing.   I Decided to only put 1 General Unit to battle.    I won.
3603	1	a	You can conquer Russia.. with Indian elephants.. in winter.               Seems Legit. 10/10 -IGN
3605	1	a	&gt; Be Marthra Confederacy &gt; Remove kebab from india. &gt; Remove silly christians from india. &gt; Have no one to remove. &gt; See middle east. &gt; Remove kebab.  10/10 would remove from premesis again.
3607	1	a	Put a few minutes in it, it's pretty good
3609	1	a	my first total war game. And definately my favorite! they need to make another empire total war with more land and better ai
3611	1	a	Ordered my Prussian hussars to charge a bunch of British Riflemen. Riflemen started running before my hussars hit them. Hussars clashed into Riflemen. Riflemen flying everywhere.  I swore I saw one Rifleman get rammed 40 yards across a field by a hussar's steed, before getting up and then dying.
3613	1	a	I rewrite my review since I forgot to say the technical parts of the game.   Yeah Empire TW is buggy and glitchy game, but at least a better than Rome 2. but still, This game make me can't stop to continue turn after turn in the campaign. This game gave best expirience after you get your goal. The odd statisfying aftertaste. Especially if you have Warpath campaign, that give you more whole new expirience but addiction if you get used to and find your way how to fight. And if you have time on battle, spent some to zoom into soldiers and hear the voices   And Multi Player, sadly almost no player now. But if there's a player this game is nice. sometimes you can win bcoz correct using of one unit. all about timing.   Choose Prussia, First time I get Loyal Ally.   God Bless Hannover
3615	1	a	Can kill natives 8/10
3617	1	a	This game is fantastic. The good things about it is the lardge scale battles, world map, the large amount of difrent units and  countries to shose from and of course the stratagy. You have to think in this game. The bad things about it is that it takes alot of memory and disk space so i reckomend to have a good PC. I have had multipel crashes in this game and corupted saves.  In all i recomend this game.
3619	1	a	IT IS AWSOME
3621	1	a	Everthing is gerat.Except for spain and russia on my campain.Russia declared war on me 8 times so far and spain 2.My only wish is that you can play as all of the countries.Otherwies everthing is great
3623	1	a	I dont see any problems with this game i think its better then Napoleon total war 10/10
3625	1	a	Overall, I'd give this game a Giant: Meh. It makes you feel immersed when You have Dragoons peeking on a hill into an small Rank of militia, but the imersion breaks when 3 or 4 seconds before they peak, your militia shoots at the ground infront of the hill. Or how the enemy is marching toward your fort, and the walls have been destroyed. What do you do? Obviously cluster ♥♥♥♥ all of you troops into 2 houses and a church! Do that and you pretty much won. Or how the Only seiges on Towns in the game are scripted, like the Battle for Bunker hill at the begining of the American campaign.   And also, they don't even have Towns! They have a village and a Capital for each territory, and they are barely that. According to this game, A city can't have more than a Canonfoundry, Govenors Barracks, Weavers Cottage and Ironsmith without being too large. And a village, errr, Town can only have 1 building like a church or a school.   Other parts of the Campaign Map are terrible, too. The diplomacy takes 1 step forward to getting rid of diplomats, but 42 large train crashes backwards when you try to make a deal. Here's an example: I was doing an england game with scotland and ireland as protectorates. I captured algiers, and of course the riots and rebelions wouldn't stop. I decided to cut my loses and sell it to Ireland. I only asked for 7000 for it, but of course no. To put that into perspective, I had to pay 135,000 for bengal in one of my old american campaigns. So, I said ♥♥♥♥ it and wanted it for millitary access. But, Nope.avi. So I decided I was 420% done, and just gave it to them, but still? No. What the actual ♥♥♥♥.jpg   There are a few good points though. Mods will make the AI better, MUCH bettter. You can play as all factions with mods, also. The campaign MAP is huge. 2x the size of rome and medieval. The time it will take to take over the world is a long ♥♥♥♥ing time. Look at how long I have been playing, I have only beaten the game 10 times, And I don't even have warpath, which adds another 20+ hours.    Overall, This game was a 6/10 for me. So, if you have Rome 1, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2, get this aswell. If not, get those first.
3627	1	a	Would be the absolut best Total War Title for me, but you can not play the Maincampain in Multiplayer.... that is realy Bad. Great Singleplayer game ! if this Game would be remade By CA with an Multiplayer Campain , it would be the best Total War ever ! PS.: If the Game is not Buggt like Rom2. Anyway its always better to read reviews before buy any Total War Games. After i was buying Rom2 i was realy angry and i give the Tipp : Dont buy Rom2 untill CA are not fixing this completly Buggt game ! Better Buy Empire and spear Money and buy Rom2 later for less Money when it is fixt. ( if they dont fix it - dont buy it ! )
3629	1	a	Empire Total War is the game in the Total War series which appears to receive the most hate. Having played the game itself, I can safely say that it is decent. As a game it does what it does but no more no less. There are a limited number of units which are available to all sides save for the Indian, Ottoman, and Maratha factions. The gameplay itself can get repetitive overtime but still follows the format seen in all Total War games. Creative Assembly had done a good job in terms of historical accuracy and introduced me to different variations of troops seen during the 1700s. Compared to the other games, I can see where the hatred is coming from and I can see it for it's flaws but it does do what it is meant to do correctly. There are also minor inconveniencies such as the tax system of having to travel from region to region just to access it's stats which gets tricky once you have occupied lot of them and that unrest is hard to quell. I will give this game a 7/10.
3631	1	a	10/10 would make America Great Britain again.
185	0	a	The AI for your troops is very bad...
3633	1	a	This is I believe the most massive of all the TW campaign maps, and it can take an eternity to achieve victory. You should know the deal. Stealing technology is a sweet feature unique to this one, and I would probably buy it just to see the uniforms, they look incredible and there are hundreds of different units.   9/10 Take it slow on the warmongering, this is not Shogun
3635	1	a	* Played it for hours * Found Darthmod * Played it for hours  Best game ever, 11/10
3637	1	a	Very good and I recommend buying it.
3639	1	a	India lost it's tea.   10/10
3641	1	a	WE NEED MORE PEOPLE PLAY THIS GAME PLEASE THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF 2020!
3643	1	a	cav. just use cav. always use cav.
3645	1	a	fun game, one of the best strategy games i own.
3647	1	a	empire total war is one of my favourite games and thats because it focuses on a really intresting historical period, has lots of content the interface is very nice and clean, it introduced naval battles that were above average it has technologies and a good goverment system.The agents feel a little bit sub par compared to the improved shogun 2 but in some cases are better that the medieval 2 ones. The AI can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there are a lot of bugs, most of them though have been fixed with patches. The DLC are not great but they aren't garbage even though you get little content for the price.The negotiation system is pretty bad, and the relations between nations is a mixed bag. I liked how the buildings works and trade is awesome. The generals though were pretty bad and gimmicky since you could win an otherwise unwinnable battle just by recruiting a bunch of them on the spot. I don not recommend this game to those that dont like this kind of warfare since some believe that watching lines of soldiers firing bullets at each other is pretty boring, as for me i really liked it especially when you get to research platoon firing.It's really addicting and very rarely annoying.
3649	1	a	Very intense and very addicting. Great RTS/Grand Strategy that covers a lot of history (even though not all of it is accurate) The campaign is fun, but short so make sure to get the DLCs when they are on sale.
3651	1	a	Alright so I played only 4.2 hours but from what i have gathered it is a decent game.  Pros: 1. Extremely challenging, more challenging than any before it in my opinion. 2. Absolutely stunning visually! One of the best looking TW games out there 3. Cool time period with lots of different cultures. 4. Fun battles.  Cons:  1. Way too complicated. Do the tutorial. 2. No rebel settlements. That means you must pick and choose your targets much more carefully. 3. Kinda annoying music.....  All in all its an 8/10 in my book. I recommend getting Darthmod for it and playing a faction like England or Prussia for your first time! 
3653	1	a	Great game!
3655	1	a	Very good first Musket Era Warfare for the total war series. Love modding it and also there are alot of goodies in this :)
3657	1	a	i love this game
3659	1	a	This game is amazing, Darthmod adds even more to it
3661	1	a	A must have game for any pc gamer. Extensive singleplayer with endless possibilities, multiplayer was limited, more so as a public player, however clan warfare was exciting and enhanced the experience.  9.5/10 pipes
3663	1	a	if you love Civ 5 you will love this
3665	1	a	This game is awesome i have over 1000 play hours in just 1 year on it
3667	1	a	A great game.... you must have this! If you like to command an army or lead great charges then this game is for you!
3669	1	a	Amazing representation of the total war games My opinion the best intro to the games as it includes some of the new features but is still not as complicated as the newer versions
3671	1	a	look at my hours on record. says it all a must buy
3673	1	a	naval battle is really beautiful.. :')  and i can play as a pirate 10/10
3675	1	a	With the Darthmod add on this game is a masterpiece.
3677	1	a	I liked the Shogun Total War games as well as this one, but i thought Empire was a little more fun.
3679	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!
3681	1	a	no one plays this anymore
3683	1	a	Empire is a great game, yes the in-game graphics have problems when you are not zoomed in close enough, yes there are various dissapointments but you ENJOY it. If you you enjoy playing it, don't whine about it's issues, have fun. I especially enjoyed playing the road to independance campaigns and aybody who enjoys RTS should have fun playing this.
3685	1	a	It is the best game ever played in the world i would totaly get this game if you have not buyed this game already i have been a total war fan for years and this is the best total war i ahve ever played :)
3687	1	a	This is my favorite game of all time!!! I love eveything about this game! The battles are fun, and I love the campaign. There are a few bugs here and there, but it is a great game! It's even better when you get mods for it! 10/10
3689	1	a	One of the best Total war i have play Really good, you should get it
3691	1	a	While you waste your time reading this, you could be playing it. If you like total war you will like this. 10/10 The Cake is a lie, Half-Life 3 confirmed
3693	1	a	This game was greate for the time that i actuly played it but it kept crashing so i only got like 10 mmins of gameplay. everytime i actuly played it it crashed. soo yeal 7.5/10 from me. 
3695	1	a	i took over the world with only indian bowmen and cavalry 100000000000000000000000000/10
3697	1	a	This is an amazing strategy game. Even though it was released in 2009 i still enjoy it now. the mix between real time and turn based strategy is realy awesome!!!! you take control of one of a variety of differnt empires and attempt to make your mark in history on a stunning in depth map. there is a lot of things you can do while managing your empire which make i really interesting and you feel like you are actualy the leader of a great nation. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!
3699	1	a	one of the better total war games but not the best
3701	1	a	It's time to kick those tea drinking pomie ♥♥♥♥♥ out of murica m8
3703	1	a	With a friend it is so intense yet fun at the same time 10/10  Pros- Graphics Multiplayer Works Fun Combat Cool Units Massive Scale  Cons- Unit Pathways can be wonkey
3705	1	a	This game is awesome
3707	1	a	Iv only had this game for a while now and i have to say its one of the best games iv played in years. I recommend you buy ASAP
3709	1	a	I'm in the Empire business.
3711	1	a	Playing this on 'Very Hard' will make you wanna kill your self. It's not as good as the previous games in the series. Rome Total War beats this one by a LONG SHOT...
3713	1	a	it is a 100% brilliant game i would play it everyday
3715	1	a	(sorry for any spelling errors)   I LOVE THIS GAME so much it is very fun and VERy reallistic i have played this for a while and love it this game is very fun from another of the total war series and they have done so well on this and i highly recomend this game to people who love the total war series and strategy games!
3717	1	a	ETW Is My Life! I love it so much I mean who doesn't? Ever Since I got the game, I have tryed to play it with every opportunity I have. But seriously play this game...     You get to use SIR ISSAC NEWTON But unfortunately, you can't reasearch Gravity :(   
3719	1	a	This is my all time favorite turn based strategy game! I never get tired of playing it. The possible scenarios seem endless. If a few DarthMod options (more promotions, unit names, adjustable turns per year, etc) had been incorporated into the original release it would be perfect. The absence of a Steam workshop is highly disappointing!
3721	1	a	I love the HUGE campaign map, now time to hang a GB flag over it all
3723	1	a	One of the best Tw games in my opinion.
3725	1	a	Lets begin by saying that Napoleon: Total War is better if you are not willing to mod this game. N:TW is basically what Empire was supposed to be. Cost an extra game's worth :(   See, E:TW was 'broken' into service. Originally so badly launched that you couldn't even play it until a week after release, it was patched over, and, over, this bug, that bug, and after a time, CA just said 'Damn, GG. Next game :('   So what's that make it now? The best Total War ever, ironically. Top three at least. Read on and see how this catastrophe turned into a miracle.  History: After a long time, post - N:TW release, the head dev of CA came out and said something along the lines of (paraphrasing) 'E:TW was just beyond the scope of what we were capable of' and just gave all the deepest dev tools over to the mod community. Damn, E:TW looked so good in previews! I honestly was rooting for them all the way - this was gonna be a showstopper. But, we got more than we bargained for.   See, guns were a massive step from medieval2 combat. Things were going to be different and people were stoked! But the AI wasn't quite there to match the era yet. For example,   -the AI for properly lining a unit and properly zerging with a axes are two separate war principles -the economy of traditional units versus guns. Sorry horses - start of point and shoot warfare -AI could not manage artillery based combat AT ALL. Oh yes, in RL they shelled people down until they did something, it's a legitimate tactic. Pretty sure firing into hills is not. -some new features like research. If 2 schools beat the AI, it wasn't ready for players to go like, 8  +Naval combat. First time ever! Ironically, this was the most polished AI and in major engagements it was okay. But when you realized it just chases it was so abusable. A 6th rate could sink the Spanish Armada solo by simply running alot and maintaining distance.  But... the scale of the world, man! Gone were the days of Europe, you now manage an Empire. Multi-map, continental combat. The Earth itself. Yet, that was too grand a step for CA. Some serious design flaws led to, once again, easily abusable tactics that needed patches. Ex. The AI 'originally' couldn't figure out how to land armies. If you were Britain you won the game, besides the OP start position you had in the world. No attempts to make a multimap game have occurred since Empire: Total War, from this time of writing. All evidence of an 'exterior world' lies on beacons or map icons representing the rest of wherever, and you send a unit to sit on it like some couch potato. In Empire, you sent a freaking army, on your navy, D-day style. Oh hell yes!  Luckily, like an Elder Scrolls mod community, E:TW's fans took the work into their hands and have many ways to polish this game into a true gem. Like rebuilding a classic car, not every '69 Fastback you can get comes in mint condition, and with the Karate Kid focus of many Empire fans, This Game is a Proper Addition to the Total War series.   Thumbs Up. So before you go autobuy N:TW, consider E:TW plus a megamod. Something like DarthMod Ultimate Commander to this. Get the same-ish game for less, but with a polished AI, bug fixes galore, and so much more potential for mischief.  Will the Inuit overwhelm the fledgling United States and invade France, causing a power struggle in Europe? Have you ever seen how big a Pirate armada can become if left unchecked? Will Britain win like always again because it has Jamaicans, or are Dutch coffee shops more powerful? All this and more inside :D
3727	1	a	Took a long time but this game finally hooked me. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: - Voice acting is EXQUISITE.   If you are multilingual, try playing one of the countries where you know their language. The Tutons speak German, the Indians speak (what? Hindi?), the Britians speak English with a British accent, and the Americans speak with an American accent.  - The tactical battles are very good.  This might also depend on what AI difficulty you choose - but at a normal difficulty tactical battles are interesting. They might even be considered the core gameplay of the game, and avoiding them with autoresolve means far worse outcomes than playing them yourself.  - The quotes during loads are interesting reading  - The way the world is divided adds a new mechanic (instead of having one contiguous map)  This adds some confusion, but after understanding it the mechanic adds an extra dimension to the gameplay.  - Economic system is good   Cons:  - By now most TBS games have a consistent UI at least where outstanding tasks are concerned, but not Total War  If you forgot to move that unit who's been sitting idle for the last 3 turns - it's your fault. You should have gone and looked at a book or something. Or you should play Warlock or Civ or Fallen Enchantress or Endless Space because ALL of those games handle this exactly the same way with a list in the right column.  - Don't let the campaign turn you off.  It's not a great campaign, but at least there is one. The downside is the campaign hides some of the goodness the game has to offer, and there are confusing moments at the very beginning where the tactical battle makes no sense. [Not a good time to confuse players. Devs, I recommend 'never' as the best time to confuse players.]  - Sea battles are just too realistic (which translates into boring)  I know I know... 'It's realistic! We went to some naval museum or whatnot and got accurate reproductions of these ships and the physics blah blah blah...' We don't care. Well I don't anyways. Can't you put in a realism slider? I'm used to ship handling like in Pirates! And this is WAAAAY too slow even accelerated.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, you can't really tell which of the various countries might resonate with you, so don't get turned off by the first country you try to play. I played Britian for a while, and then on a whim switched to playing India and loved it. The best way is to experiment.  In all it's a satisfying game.   If you aren't absolutely sure it will play on your systme (and some people have seen crashes), then try the demo first.
3729	1	a	One of the best Tw games in my opinion.
188	0	a	This game had so much potential, but it just falls flat in every regard. Poor AI, dull units fighting in an even duller style of combat, awful ship battles that always descened into total chaos, and poor diplomacy. Not worth a buy. I recommend Shogun II. That's much better.
189	0	a	Garbage ===========================  The controls are cumbersome and the units randomly disobey orders, making control on the battlefield frustrating:  - the units keep switching to slow speed whenever you reroute them while marching - artillery frequently keeps firing even after you order it to pack and retreat (killing your own advancing troops) only if you deselect 'fire at will' it's guaranteed to stop - you can't create a path with waypoints.  Battles, and especially sieges, are ludicrous and pathetic: - Forts are indestructible - the only way to capture them is by climbing the walls (really, in the age of artillery?) - The battle map is too small, you are not allowed to freely deploy your army and the game assigns you the most inconvenient spot  - reinforcing enemy armies appear out of nowhere right near you, without any notice - artillery that rarely hits anything, although it's 'accuracy' is 45%. I tested once firing against a still infantry formation and registered a hit after 30 rounds. - brain dead AI that keeps standing still in the middle of artillery fire - large rebel armies with cavalry and artillery units spawned against game mechanics (how could recruitment happen so fast especially when you have 20 unit army in the province - and where would the money come from)  The game map is terribly unbalanced, the provinces are way too large and weirdly separated.  The whole concept of 'gentlemen' and rakes is completely beyond me, especially the difficulty in assasinating them. You should at least be able to expel or arrest them as an 'absolute monarch' of a mighty 'empire'. It would have been much better if you could recuit them like you do with armies and send them as ambassadors.  Units appearing on the map are too large and those stupid flags are too big and obtrusive.  Extremely dense and suicidal AI players that keep declaring war against much bigger opponents: if you declared war on me and I took three of your provinces including the capital, how would I give you one of my provinces when you call for peace?  Too much art, too little substance.

3733	1	a	Fantastic game 8/10
3735	1	a	Awesome game for the most part, some annoying design flaws and glitches though.
191	0	a	As of 5/11/2016 (or 11/5 for you americans) 1.5 version This game still isnt fixed. IVE NEVER FINISHED THIS CAMPAIGN. EVER. As soon as i get late game my Autosaves, Manual Saves and Quick Saves corrupt. I have to start over again. Do not purchase this game if you anticipate having a smooth time because you wont. This game is amazing and i love the span of Empire but CA you need to fix your bloody game.
3737	1	a	its a great strategy game better than any other game in the world! 
3739	1	a	A massive game has continued to get better with Darth Mod's patches etc it's now far better than it was on releaseand it is great fun fighting the American War of Independance as well as lot of other wars around the same period. Probably the best TW game ever made and the onyl one that has remained on my computer, even if its just because I love fighting armoured elephants!
195	0	a	A good turn-based strategy game. The things they got right are mostly how you manage your country's resources and diplomatic relations. In my experience with the game, I have encountered major problems in terms of computing casualties/damage, to the point where the only real way to win is to bayonet rush or use the 'autoresolve' feature. I recall witnessing on several occasions a foot soldier take a cannonball to the face and continue marching unscathed. This may have been fixed in newer versions, or it could have been a problem with my hardware.
196	0	a	u shouldnt try this game because u will get game crashed error.I investigated and most ppl having same problem even they paid for the game like me.So i wont pay for another TOTAL WAR game.
197	0	a	I'm not going to write a complex review likve I've done before. I'll just say this; Empire is a good game, with good mechanics, a good environment, and a good theatre of war. The problem with Empire is that it's dying. Napoleon has basically rendered this game obsolete since it just expands on this game but brings in new things and slightly better land and naval combat. Therefore I cannot recommend this game since there is a successor. However, if you like to fight on different fonts, this game is good. Just keep in mind that it is fairly buggy.
198	0	a	It's a good game, but the Mac version is too riddled with bugs to be enjoyable.
199	0	a	Cannister shot VS cavalry simulator
3741	1	a	With help of a mod, I was able to transform Scotland into a world trading superpower. What is not to love?
201	0	a	Ok! I admit myself I love the Total War games! Unfortunately this one wasn't what I expected. Bunch of lag in the campaign map, UI can sometimes be screwed up, and the AI is at it's worst. Not saying this is definitely the worst of the series, but don't spend your money on this one. Get Medieval 2, Shogun 2 or Rome 1 for a great experience!
3743	1	a	The grand campaign is the meat of Empire: Total War, and it's there where you're likely to spend the most amount of time. The game stretches across the 18th century and lets you choose from a number of world powers, from Great Britain and Russia to fallen domains such as the Maratha Confederacy and the Ottoman Empire. Once you choose an empire, you can select from a few different campaign types that determine victory conditions and campaign length. Whichever you decide, be prepared: Even a short, 50-year campaign can take a good amount of time to complete, given that each turn requires strategic thinking on multiple fronts. Battles usually determine how regions are won and lost, but diplomatic relations, economic strangleholds, assassinations, and many other subtleties must be tweaked and considered at each turn, and they have noticeable impact as the years progress. If this sounds overwhelming, or if you're an American history buff, you'll want to check out the Road to Independence campaign before jumping into the grand one. This is essentially a long American tutorial that slowly introduces you to the basics and culminates in a grand campaign of its own.  The factors you must consider run the gamut, starting with an important new feature: the technology tree. Three areas of research and multiple subtrees let you improve your military, industry, and philosophy; in turn, your choices may benefit your economy or your success in battle. The benefits may seem minor at first, but as the campaign wears on, their effects are more noticeable, and your choices within these trees must be informed by the strengths and weaknesses of your particular empire. Do you concentrate on industry and use sheer numbers of troops to overwhelm your enemies, or do you focus on naval improvements and reap the ensuing benefits of successful trade-route blockades? As your campaign wears on, your needs may shift, whether because enemy blockades require a stronger navy, because you are spreading quickly across land, or because your economy is unable to sustain your growing army. Technology is also a limited diplomatic option, given that it's a commodity that you can not only trade during negotiations but also steal from foes. Additionally, it's not easy to convince a friendly nation to offer technology. Even when offered multiple technologies or monetary compensation, your closest allies rarely accept a request to share even a single technology, which makes it a limited political tool. In Empire: Total War, knowledge is more easily stolen than shared.  In fact, your more successful political dealings are the underhanded ones. Your agents may differ between nations (for example, gentlemen and rakes for the British, scholars and hashishin for the Ottomans), but the tasks are similar: covertly disrupt the affairs of your enemies and potential enemies. Religious agents such as missionaries will slowly but surely convert the populace, staving off potential rebellion in newly captured regions. On the other hand, the impact of religion is not as deep or impactful as in the Europa Universalis series, in which social and diplomatic events are more fully explored. Regardless, it's great fun to cripple whole economies, especially when your strategies work in tandem with each other. Sending in a naval fleet to seize enemy trade supplies, sending another directly into an enemy's port (and therefore obstructing incoming goods), and dispatching an agent to sabotage commercial ports can have profound effects. In cases like these, an angry, resource-deprived public and cash-strapped armies then ease the way for a quick triumph.   Overall i think this is one of my favorite games of my childhood, which i totally suggest anyone who hasn't been able to play this game to get it and try it.
3745	1	a	This is Gods gift to history buffs and geeks!
203	0	a	There are a lot of bugs in this game. It needs to be fixed.
204	0	a	No mods base game evaluation. DO NOT BUY. Overall score 3/10  This game plainly capitalizes on the success of previous releases. First time for me when CA seriously dropped the ball, but the more I play it the more I realize I should have had a refund.  Positives The game looks good when zoomed in. New game mechanics in advanced trade, multi warzones around the globe. Sea combat. New nations.  Negatives Feel: Maybe it is the period, but all European nations feel totally the same. Other than that nations have specific end buildings in capitals which helps with the immersion. Fights: 0/10 to AI quality. Pathfinding is abismal. You attack a unit infront of you, and your guys start running away (not retreating, or fleeing, running away from their goal.) Worse is, if you click right behind the enemy, they run towards the point without an issue. (Something is wrong with the attack script and it mainly happens in fort defense or attack.) Units CANNOT use walls. This was done in medieval, but here CA failed to do what they already had in the past. 1 guy is out of position running back and forth in the same place, so the entire unit just stands about without firing a single shot. And units CANNOT find a route off-on a wall. 1 bloke is stuck on the wall? Well the entire unit runs back to him, even if they almost reached their target already. Gates are used in a 1 man line for some reason they are as if they were a tight rope.  Your cannons play a very important role. BUT you MUST switch off auto aim. The canon crews execute themselves firing sideways, through the cannon next to them within the same crew, just to be scared of their own mental backwardness and flee in terror. They will also happily execute anyone on their side without further consideration.  If you want to put down money for such a game buy medieval or 'buy it off a friend' and fund modders who may fix this cluster mess. On that point, it is also harder to mod this game than Medieval, so you will find fewer overhauls and fixes.  Whioever scored this game higher... I do not know what you see in it, compared ot working games. If I put Medieval2 at 8/10 this cannot be above 5. It is bling and nicer, but years have passed, it MUST be nicer. If this was released by anyone else it would be a total flop without a single mention in any gaming press.
3747	1	a	i like it but it needs a work shop
3749	1	a	Would be more fun if you could shoot your retreating soldiers..
3751	1	a	This game, unlike most strategy games is great. It is mostly correct historically, and the campaign makes sense
3753	1	a	spam life guards and arty gas and u win
208	0	a	How the HELL did this get 92% positive reviews? Buggy as the Amazon, battle engine is so stupid that it hurts, agents aren't recruited manually and if you don't install mods this game is about as good as being burnt alive. And for some ♥♥♥♥ING stupid reason I can't set my graphics higher than medium so it looks incredibly ugly.
209	0	a	Thoroughly unimpressive. To be honest, I wanted to like this game. It looks like a Total War game but alas, it does not feel or play like one. I guess I was just looking for something more... entertaining?  First off, I'm a fan of the time period. That was one of the biggest draws for me. But for every step forward, I feel like Empire Total War takes two steps back. The first sign of disappointment came after two and a half hours of game play. Up until that point, I was still getting acclimated to the controls, visuals, etc etc. The time came for me to boldly ride forth and vanquish my foes in an enemy fort. What transpired could only be described as a giant boring mosh pit. Clones in different color clothing flailed at each other for a while; desperate to get those kill moves in before they all die of old age. On the fastest speed, it probably took five minutes of real time to clear up the traffic jam at hole in my enemies wall. Still, I was optimistic.  A few hours of gameplay later, and another incident occurred. This time I was defending my fort against my enemies. I was clearly unprepared and had a disadvantage in both troop number and troop quality. At all other points of the game, I was playing to the numbers and crushing every battle; so obviously my expectation was that I was on the receiving end of the beating this time. Yet the AI curiously decided to section its assaulting force into bits and parade around my fort; instead of assaulting it head on, like someone trying to win would. Needless to say, that didn't end well for them. After that, I couldn't pretend that I liked this game anymore.  But at the end of the day, I can't say I hate this game. Sure, my list of complaints are many; but it all boils down to what I had feared... This game isn't a total war game. It's someones crude imitation of what a total war game set in this period would look like. That's not to say it isn't terrible. It's just dull. For my money, the original rome total war, or shogun 2 are superior in both spirit and gameplay.  
210	0	a	Crashes, runs slowly, hard to read, Steam refuses to recognize when it's been exited and as a result despite having only played it for 5 minutes Steam says I played for 25 hours and refuses to give a refund after I explained this twice. Bad game, awful customer service
3755	1	a	One of the best strategy games in history and arguably the best Total War™ game. This game is a masterpiece. Great gameplay and graphics. Buy it, you won't regret it!
3757	1	a	Empire: Total War had a really shaky launch plagued by horrendous load times and lots of bugs. Now that most of those have been sorted out, it's a solid entry into the Total War franchise that keeps the deep strategic goodness of the previous games while trying new things (eg. research, lots of minor nations, etc.). Some of it succeeds and some fails, but ultimately E:TW is worth grabbing for fans of the franchise. It seems easier than the games that came before it however, so fair warning there.
3759	1	a	  Introduction
3761	1	a	A 'Indian Murder Fest' sim where you play as america and you mow down indians with muskets cause the indians charge at them
211	0	a	i love this but its unplable due to bugs
3763	1	a	Wish the game was more complete... overall....    8/10 Would Conquer Again....
3765	1	a	Basically kill everyone and take everyones land
213	0	a	This is my least favorite total war game, I just could not really get into it like the other total war games.   It showed me that a ranged combat focused total war game is a bad total war game. Land battle is just boring imho, and you have to micromanage all the time to avoid friendly fire. There are tons of unit in this game, but pretty much all of them are men with muskets in different colors. Unit movement is glitchy (horses sometimes slide on the ground without moving their bodies lol), AI is glitchy (like in most total war games, but happens more often, like AI melee infantry just stand and let you get free shots at them).   I really dont like how they nerfed cavalry in this game, they will drop like flies if getting in the range of line infantry, they are even not good at chasing down routing enemy now because they would get stuck in a 10 seconds long dueling animation with a roundting militia like WTF. Now most battle pretty much plays like getting your line infantry forming up formation, and then just watch them shot at enemy until rout, or maybe charge enemy if you got number advantage / enemy better at range / have more cannons etc. This kind of battle certainly does not appeal to me who like the melee combat in the other total war games.  Anyway, I will sum up my opinion:   &gt;Land battle is god awful, repetitive slow and boring  &gt;The newly introduced Sea battle is good but require a lot of micro-management  &gt;New campaign features like technology are welcomed addition.  &gt;Major nerfed generals and cavalry. Generals do not give speech anymore, they are so generic. Melee Cavalry are so underwhelming, because their small number, they can be killed easily by pretty much everyone including artillery and infantry with bayonet and box formation. Dragoons/ ranged cavalry are pretty good though.  &gt;AI is very predictable, but you can say the same for the other total war games too.  &gt;Hands down the Worst soundtrack in total war games ever, seriously it is so bad almost make my ears bleed. especially the 'Native American' soundtrack (and they even recycled the old M2TW Native American soundtrack in empire, so lazy), along with their jaw-dropping OP land armies makes the Native American my worst nightmare in empire total war. Even though by the same composer, the sound track is much improved in rome 2, although still miles away from the legendary Jeff Van Dyck's work.  After investing more than 100 hours in Empire, I still think I liked Rome 2 better than this game. As I recall Empire also had a really glitchy launch, and it is the start of the DLC policy in total war series, I really dont understand how a lot more people hate rome 2 than empire.  I would not recommend this game unless you really like the time period, there are much better total war games out there, and my current Top 1 is still Medieval 2 Total War
214	0	a	This game could be good had it been more developed. The land combat is not bad in theory but its quite messy when possitioning units. The map is ok, but the minimap is very hard to read. The tutorial taught me nothing about the game only about the combat system, land to be exact. But the main reason why this game isnt good, the sea combat. Its so messy, so impossible to use. When you give an order to a specivic ship it wont always do what you told them. Somethimes it will in fact do something completely diferent. They move sooooo slow, while yes thats realistic its super boring. If you want to make this game realistic you shouldnt even be able to see any battles. So instead of making it partially realistic how about making it enjoyable.
215	0	a	Never been a fan of this one. The map is meh and battles are always pretty laggy.
3767	1	a	Buy 'Napoleon: Total War' instead. Its multiplayer is actually alive, better graphics, better optimized, and it has one of the best mods ever created for any game. The 'Darth Mod'.  If you're generally a Total War fan though, it's indeed worth it.
3769	1	a	Love the sea battles!
3771	1	a	It is a cool game.
3773	1	a	No mods,wishing more melee units for british,french,spanish,prussia,austria,ect...Diplomatic structure is overall good,but not as good as rome 2's.I would suggest this game to anyone looking for a good colonial game.However,do keep in mind the FEW flaws in the game.
3775	1	a	Music sucks and is really buggy, heavily unbalanced AI system and is one of the Best TW games out there
3777	1	a	Still one of the best strategy games I have ever played.
219	0	a	Empire: Total War takes some great steps forward but you can definitely tell that the developers were stepping outside their comfort zone with this game. City sieges for some reason have been relegated to attacking/defending a fort for some reason which is crazy since Medieval 2 (released 3 years prior) had a multitude of different maps which included full sprawling cities, forts, and encampments.  I’ve also noticed that actually just using your infantry in melee is generally more effective than just trading musket fire (especially if they have any experience).  Really, if I didn’t know any better I’d say this was a mediocre mod for an older TW game.
3779	1	a	This game is very good.
3781	1	a	i do recommend this game i like it it was my frist game and i think you should try it 
3783	1	a	actually a really fun game, despite being a bit old.
3785	1	a	I played a mathara confederacy (spelling) and defeated the mughals, i then proceeded to take the middle east and go north through the caucaus, defeating russia with sweden. I gave sweden sri lanka earlier but then i realized i needed that to win so i broke our alliance and took it back, me and sweden are now worst enemies and im taking the balkans with my army of european-indian soldiers. 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ sweden again
3787	1	a	Had to fight ten French line infantry units with one brittish Militia unit, the french surrendered. 10/10
221	0	a	Not that good but playable
3789	1	a	Best Game ever thets reunite the great English Empire once more! 
222	0	a	I got this as part of a bundle. The rest of the total war bundle is pretty good. Shogun 2 has its issues and medieval 2 has a couple of bugs, and rome is perfect.  Empire, on the other hand, doesn't even qualify as a finished product. Within minute one of any given battle you will see soldiers moonwalking in place, units inexplicably forming into single file lines to march around the battlefield, clumsy, weightless 'animations' that somehow manage to feel less violent than even the very rudimentary moves of rome (probably because the only sound effect in the game is the sound of gunfire/cannon fire (!)), and unit models that manage to be less detailed than medieval 2's and debatably less detailed than Rome's. The campaign map is bloated with 'features' that mostly serve to reduce player agency-No manual recruitment of agents would be the cardinal example of this.  Oh, and all written information in the game is in, at a rough estimate, eight-point font.  Empire is honestly a depressing 'game', all the more so because of how much of an omen it turned out to be for the direction the Total War series turned out to go. It's chilling that somebody looked at this game, presumably played it for ten minutes, and then said, 'Yes, this is a finished product.'
3791	1	a	Kappa/10 would conquer the world under the Swedish flag again and again and again
223	0	a	This game is beyond terribly optomized, the framerate drops to 24fps whenever you try and move the camrea...ON MEDIUM! I am running a GTX 760 and an i5-4430 processor, this game is from 2009, complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
3793	1	a	10/10, Would TAKE OVER THE WORLD with Prussia again.
3795	1	a	I decided to play as Sweden. After the first turn I got a trade agreement with Great Britain and became allies. The next turn Great Britain betrayed me and made it their number one goal to destroy me. So I took over England, Scotland, and Ireland. Then I went on to make the glorious Swedish Empire.   10/10 would be betrayed by Britain again
3797	1	a	Probably the best Total War game since Rome.
3799	1	a	I made a porcupine out of pikemen while my friend charged at me with thousands of natives. His men got shish kabobed while I sat there with pride as my Porcupine takes down its final men. My friend cries as I triumph over his redskins dead corpses. This game is rated 10/10 by Master Bater.
3801	1	a	Invade america and shoot many indians. 10/10
3803	1	a	The only game where you can invade Russia , in the winter.
3805	1	a	If you ever feel a deep emotional loss in your heart from not being able to massacre the Indians cerca 1700-1800 this game is your ticket
225	0	a	Game was super fun until it BROKE during campaign story part three! Dx
226	0	a	It was fun at first but then it just became the same thing over and over again and naval battles are boring and slow and I can't do a beach assult on an harbour because now you have to land your troops somewere else to walk around and then assult the harbour from land but what I wanna do is to see the smoke from the towns and harbours as they are getting bombarded from the cannons on the ships to later send your men out in smaller boats to shore.  How it is know I wouldn't recomend this game
3807	1	a	A great game for anyone who likes history
3809	1	a	Great depth and challenge. Line Infantry overload but that was the manner of warfare.
3811	1	a	Ive spent so much time playing this game its soooo ♥♥♥♥ing good
3813	1	a	Only playable with Darth Original: 6/10 if you dont encounter any bugs that CA didn't fix and wont fix Darth: 8/10 it's gr8 m8
3815	1	a	Carlos II is the most bested man to have ever ruled spain. His inbread-holyness just acompanies him through life and lets him rule the world. I mean come on this guys father was his aunts sisters brothers fathers daughter! Simple right? From Iceland to Persia, From India to America, this is the man you want ruling your country. Nothing says 'Man this guy is hot' than drooling, which is another great characteristic about Carlos II. Carlos II gets all the countries on his side with -20 to diplomatic relations of european countries, this guy is like a grown child! The -2 prestige per turn also lets you be the last country on the Greatest Countries Ever leader board. I mean this guy is a FREAK OF NATURE! Who wouldnt want this guy? This guy also has a bad case of raving. You havent heard of raving? Lemme get my  urbandictionary.com  real quick oh yea Raving: talk wildly or incoherently, as if one were delirious or insane. Yep thats carlos for ya. Welp I hope this tells you how much Carlos II really matters in this game. Come on say it with me, CARLOS II FOR WORLD SUPREME LEADER!
229	0	a	The game just keeps crashing and if you read the forums im not alone with this issue. Worst programing Ive ever come across.
3817	1	a	The game is good and classic TW game, but battle bullet animations are a bit old. This game was published before Shogun2:FotS, so the bullet animations are a bit old and buggy.   But anyway good old classic.
3819	1	a	This is a great game if you love military type stuff it is an amazing game totally recomended
3821	1	a	This is a great game. I only wish it had multiplayer capability. This is one of those rare games where you get to experience how millitary and diplomatic strategies worked in historical times. To anyone just starting the game, I would recommend a mod called Darthmod Total war for Empire total war. It is a complete overhaul and improves on everything. My only complaint is that the map AI is a 'little' stupid.  All in all, great game!
3823	1	a	This game is really fun and I recommend this game for people who like strategy.
3825	1	a	- Plays as Britain - Is British and stuff - Does the sciencing - Is a pacifist - Hangs out with the French - The French invade - Science means nothing to bullets - Much Democracy Such Death Everyone Ded - 8/8 would get trampled for being a pacifist in a Total War game again
3827	1	a	when i first baught this game i was very confused on the controls and functions so i put it asside for quite a while. but i came back to this and tried my best to master this even thoe now im kind of crappy with multi battles i soon got used to all the functions strategys and functions i say this is a great game !
3829	1	a	Played as Maratha Confederacy (Present day India)  Went to War against Ottoman Empire (Present day Turkey)  Charged the Ottoman Empire with my Elephant Calvary   Got decimated by 64-Lb artillery  10/10 would get shelled again
230	0	a	Started playing this game again, forgotten just how often these Total War games crash :(  And the AI, really? Hardest difficulty means every single faction declares war on you? Sheesh...  Three continents means too much micromanagement Naval strategy eludes me entirely Loooove the series, loathe this instance  4/10
3831	1	a	ITS FRICKING AWESOME BEST RTS EVER oh and rts= real time stratagey
231	0	a	Game always bugs out or crashes when you are just starting to enjoy the game.  Total mess/10, play Napoleon or Shogun 2 instead.
3833	1	a	Play as the British  Take over the world Avoid Brexit Avoid Trump Drink Tea  10/10 would re-write history again
3835	1	a	pls implement darthmod for mac and make darthmod offical
3837	1	a	this is a great game and even if you dont have a very good computer i fully recommend this game
3839	1	a	Brilliant Strat Game, one of the best!
3841	1	a	this game is one of the best of the time period but for me it won't open anymore
3843	1	a	The Revolution Sweet!
3845	1	a	While old, Total war Empire gives a very large selection of territories and factions, with more flexibility than newer games, such as Rome 2, Shogun 2 or Napoleon.
3847	1	a	No better tactical series unlike Total War, especially for world domination.
3849	1	a	I just can't get enough of this game. Epire Total War 2 please but fix RTW 2 first, lol.
3851	1	a	Hey guys were goin' way back in time with this game, Empire Total War was one of the first Total War games along side Rome and Shogun. Empire is a strategy game where you can go in deep and command your soldiers as they battle with muskets and cannons or stay far away and command on a global state. Build or upgrade cities, research technology, or build a great army to conquer your enemies. Be any country in India, North America, or Europe and try to survive the 1700's. Check this game out and enjoy conquering the world.
3853	1	a	Age of Enlightenment is a perfect period of time for such a game. For 2009 graphics are just fantastic. Fans of both history and strategies will find this game very attractive. One of the best strategies ever created (IMHO) 10/10
3855	1	a	8/10 Too much water -ign
232	0	a	the battle is way to easy to play :\ and the cavalry srsly suxks 
233	0	a	this game is fun untill it stops working not worth 20 bucks  '
3857	1	a	As with real-life Empires, this game is massive, occasionally unpleasant to look at (the usual wall maneuvering problems and suicidal A.I charging into the line of fire), but diverse; it sounds boring, but the diplomacy is a huge improvement on the previous games, and a proper tech tree actually allows choice where advances where previously given by passing x number of turns.  Huge and engrossing enough to overlook some of the loose threads that come out of the seams.
3859	1	a	Played as The British , put both campaing dificulty and battle dificulty to Maximum. 2nd turn : every one declared war on me, 10th turn: i was invaded by the french and and died. 20/10 Literaly Total War.
3861	1	a	it's alright i guess  too many powdered wigs imo
3863	1	a	good game but alot of errors freezes and takes ages to load
3865	1	a	This is one of the best games ever. Every RTS fan SHOULD have this game. I don't know from what to start from, Wide variety of countries, from native americans (Warpath Expansion) to Poland and even Russia and... even India. The battle mechanics are easy and intuitave, every battle is unique. The graphic is perfect even as a game from 2009. And I could go for ages. Just Buy It.
235	0	a	Absolute Garbage!  Even still after being out for like 6 years the game still lacks any resemblence of a good game. Without mods the AI is completely brain dead. Just throws legions of militia and pikemen into gun fire. Diplomacy is probably mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as for some reason everyone and their grandma declares war on you for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason. It goes from friendly realtions to ♥♥♥♥ you without a single warning or reason. Public order prevents you from ♥♥♥♥ing doing anything as they revolt instantly if they are unhappy. Nothing to be desired, the gameplay is at least cool being the few games the feature 18th century warfare.
3867	1	a	I like the game a lot but sieges suck and are horribly unrealistic and bowmen shoot their bows maybe once or twice a minute, while musketeers shoot once a minute at most because they are too busy shoving the ramrod down the barrel for 20 years, it is like they are masterbating with their guns. The naval battles are moderatly entertaining but the same thing, cannons take rediclous amounts of time to reload, just like land battles.  I enjoyed the campaign a lot but the battles were certainly not for me considering I like historical accuracy and men who dont masturbate with their weapons during battle!  The American campaigns of indipendence are frusturating to say the least, you need to get TONS of land to win your freedom, some of it in Canada that we never even went to during the Revolution, let alone capture. So you are spread rediclously thin against the might of the British Empire and they expect you to capture what seems like 80-90 percent of North America to win the game.  The only units that functioned even a little bit realisticly was the cavalry but building and reserching is rediculously slow and expensive so getting good cavalry early on is difficult. Oh and when pikemen charge they do it with swords, not their pikes.  I only recommend this game if you enjoy the campaign games of previous total war games rather than the battles, just get it on sale and don't buy any dlc.
3869	1	a	Until you get Darthmod dont expect 18th century battles, vanilla is more about just inf and cav since arty is to inaccurate to few pieces per squad and unit sizes of inf/cav are to small to hit them effecitvely as well as not nearly long enough range, that said this does makes for a more tactical MP experience.  however dont play the campain without Darthmod as Darthmod really gives a proper feel of 18th century warfare. (arty actually is necessary as in history it was) but still fun game none the less. Other wise its a Acrady infantry rush  grab it on sale and expect Diplomacy (the most broken in any Total war game) to be against you at all times and you can still have fun   also avoid Fort battles (they can be turned off all together with darth mod) although tacticly wise to use this game doesnt handle them well the AI bugs out and then it lags/crahses when the AI does its movement bug during a fort battle (doesnt matter defending or Attacking).  those intrested in Darthmod you will find it here with instructions within the dowload thread (read the list of threads you'll find the download one)   http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?1126-DarthMod-Empire

236	0	a	This game is very entertaining to play. However, the Steam version of it is awful. I have yet to actually beat the game because when I get around 3/4ths of the way it crashes and the autosave file ends up corrupted so it can't be loaded. Total War games have always been great, but do yourself a favor and get another version.
237	0	a	Just buy Shogun 2 Fall of The Samurai. So much better executed as a game and is quite similar to Empire.
3873	1	a	The best game, really enjoed the many hours playing Empire, Total War. 
3875	1	a	  Good game, fun to rek Ben in a 1v1
3877	1	a	Ruled fron America to Middle East, from South Africa to Persia, the only remaining nations are me and Mughals. Mughals have only India, I have the god damn world, I had lost the war.   9/10 would kick your bottocks on multiplayer cuz I have dlc units.
3879	1	a	'Thus begins my dominatening!'- Demoman
3881	1	a	Very good game, like all the others in the series Total War. I'm your big fan.
3883	1	a	11/9 would be bugged for land every turn by Russia again
3885	1	a	Great games. Don't loose your general
3887	1	a	What an amazing game. Even after all these years it still holds up as an excellent rpg. Still playing after 200+ hours on different consoles. Worth a buy!
3889	1	a	The game is great I just wish they had more mods for it and dlcs they should have sat down and added things to it
3891	1	a	My personal favorite TW to date. HUGE battles/campaign map. And the era is just great.
3893	1	a	I dont know why people say it failed, you probably can tell by how long ive played it.  Here is what i do to succefully win global domination.  &gt;Start as spain. &gt;Research as fast as i can. &gt;Train peasants to fight and make them cazadores. &gt;Win with peasant cazodores.  10/10 would win with peasants again.
3895	1	a	The one of the best game in Total War series
3897	1	a	  It's ok
3899	1	a	One of the best installements in the franchise (Not sure if I said that correctly). This is simply brilliant. It does get kinda annoying managing everything you have once you get big.
3901	1	a	Step 1: Buy the game Step 2: Play before experiencing Darthmod Step 3: Install Darthmod for Empire Step 4: Realize how awful Vanilla version is Step 5: Love Darthmod for Empire Step 6: Recommend game for the sole purpose of Darthmod
3903	1	a	Do you like some large waves of troops clashing in some servere 18th century combat? This is the one to get. Nice ancient pirate style ship combat. You can use artillery to soften up the enemy lines. Then move in with muskets and swords to kill your enemy. With or without the support of large groups of horse cavellery.   The graphics look good. The units are detailed for a large scale combat. The sounds and music match the game. Nice indeed a definitve must have I must say.
3905	1	a	Great game its really fun
3907	1	a	I would play it all the time but i have a Mac and i have this computer from 2005 thats a windows computer so i am kinda ♥♥♥♥ed.But i have already torrented the game before so i do reccomend it. (It was a sale for $3.74, i had to buy it).
3909	1	a	Very addicting and fun!
239	0	a	I try starting the game but nothing pops up and then it goes back to where it says I'm not playing it. Nothing is working. Broken game. Refund.
3911	1	a	This is the best real time strategy game that takes place in the gunpowder era on the market today. The base game is really good with a easy to understand yet strategic battle gameplay. A nice campaign map which allows you to chose what to specialise in and when, and it somewhat allows you to 'roleplay'. If you like these types of games but after playing this feel that something is missing then look no further than the Darthmod Empire mod (DME for short) it almost completely overhauls the game and adds tons of units and factions.
3913	1	a	Empire total war, so much to do so little time. A good addition to the Total war series which I love but not the best. A few bugs here and their but all in all if you like the histoical background of the colonial era then this indeed worth a try. 6/10
3915	1	a	One of my all time favourite games in the Total War series a complete master piece! you can do basically everything on the campaign map and the campaign features are absouletly crazy! i like the Prussian army and the whole game is just amazing 9/10
3917	1	a	play this  
3919	1	a	Very good and strategic, especially with the Darthmod overhaul mod.
3921	1	a	Ravage the land and conquer the sea as you play Empire Total War
3923	1	a	Out of any of the TW games ive played, I put the most hours into this one. Engine works great for this type of combat. Feels like theres way more strategy involved because of the ranged combat compared to the ME Rome or SG era combat. That all being sad, I prefer to play the Napoleon expansion, its Empire but improved everything.
3925	1	a	Do they have this on for Apple computers?
3927	1	a	This game is very fun; Its an awesome, fun, and interesting RTS game that is set in the time of the late 1700s. You can take over the world, or keep your nation alive and wealthy by trading with other nations, or try to survive as your puny nation is hit by wave after wave of enemy troops.
3929	1	a	I am a huge fan of the Strategy/Tycoon/Simulation genre in gaming. And, after three years of playing this game. I must say, this is certainly one of the better ones- if not, the BEST. On a multitude of accounts, I've played over 500+ hours on all of them. This game is addicting, and time consuming.  The game has a few modes. Campaign, where you take command of a nation, and have 99 years to build your empire globally. And then there is Multiplayer. The name says it all. It's where you attempt to out strategies the enemy. And lastly, it gives you the option to participate in a battle of your choice. This gives you the option to play land, sea, siege, or scenario battles. Each is unique, and synchronizes nicely.   PROS: *A Wide array of options, to rule your country. *Real-time experience. *Beautiful music *Jaw-droppingly addictive.  CONS:  *Horrendous face models. *Frequent online crashing *Half-brained AI. ( Both yours, and your opponents )
3931	1	a	This Game can really give you a headache on what your thinking of doing saying that theres enemys allies and many features you can use in this game of total warfare
3933	1	a	-Starts up game -Awesome intro, game looks appealing -Selects Grand Campaign -Selects United Provinces, because I see a lot of potential in them -Starts off constructing buildings in Amsterdam -Suddenly out of nowhere, Spain declares war on me -♥♥♥♥ -Emasses a 1200 man army in Netherlands, and a 400 man army in Gutch Guyana -Decicively defeats the Spanish at Amsterdam, Cuba and Brussels -Signs a peace treaty with Spanish, annexing Brussels and Cuba, all seems g -Frace declares war -.... -Sends army to Paris and quickly defeats them, annexing Alsace-Lorraine, and gives Paris to Great Britain -Bavaria, Wurrtemburg Hannover and Westphalia declare war on me -Im starting to get the hang of this -Annexes Wurrtemburg, Hannover and Westphalia and gives Bavaria to Prussia -Poland, Russia and Courland form a coalition against me -Great Britain and Prussia come to my aid, yey -Loses to the Polish at Konigsberg, but wins after -Poland declares war on Austria and fully annexes Austria -I invade the Austrian provinces -After that, I invade Warsaw and Vilnius -Poland is destroyed -To make peace with Russia, I give Lithuania, Minsk and all of Polands eastern provinces to them gives the rest of my captured provinces to Prussia -And I live a happily ever after....   -BUT WAIT -Guess who's back? Back again? Spain is back, tell a friend! -Spain invades France and Cuba and captures them -They enter my territory and I halt them a Brussels -I defeat them at Paris and win at Madrid and Cuba -I annex the rest of Spains colonial empire and give Madrid to Great Britain -The year is 1749 -Whelp, gg  11/10 bruv
3935	1	a	Very nice game, good graphics though a bit old by today's standards. The gameplay is rather well-balanced and it's very enjoyable. Some nasty bugs nonetheless which lower global game experience. Very valuable at a low price (only) now.
3937	1	a	This is my favorite game by far!
3939	1	a	would invade europe as the netherlands again
3941	1	a	Good Medieval II successor, but lacks XVII century and some European campaigns.
3943	1	a	testicles. that is all.
240	0	a	this is the only totaly war game that doesnt work for me.  totally broken, you play 10 minutes of it and it crashes. and units look ♥♥♥♥ when you zoom out in battle, look like cardboard despite high end pc and top settings.  its unplayable because of the first fact, it crashes before you can enjoy it. its a shame really because if it managed to stay on without crashing out and booting you from game all the time it very well could have been a decent game.  but based on the fact it doesnt work i really cant reccomend this, especially due to the fact that every other total war game works perfectly for me with no crashes, this empire one is the only one out of entire series that dont work.  so basically avoid this ♥♥♥♥ and buy one of the other total war games.
3945	1	a	really fun game if u like historic battles like this
3947	1	a	'I never saw so many shocking bad hats in my life '

3953	1	a	where do i go to watch replays of your battles does anyone know?
3955	1	a	You can't take this game seriosly... it's just to much fun. 9.75471/2 IGN
3957	1	a	Empire total war adds a new meaning to strategy.if you are a major strategy fan or if you love the revalutionary war fan, then you should deffinetly buy it whenever you can.sorry for the poor spelling
241	0	a	So I personally never plan to buy another total war game since due to my large monitor I can't read any information on the screen and the company doesn't offer any support on this. So I basicaly got screwed out of my money buying these games.
3959	1	a	A great fun game to sit back and relax with.
3961	1	a	This is a fun game if you're looking for a Historical Stratagy game, one downside may be long wait times after you are done with your turn but it's not that bad.
3963	1	a	good so good and that is what she sed
3965	1	a	Amazing... dated now but was amazing! 9/10.
3967	1	a	Going through the Total War games in order of release, I came upon a strange offspring of the series called Empire. Now mind you, in this review I will be describing both the game as it was released and patched over time, and I will cover a mod for this game that I am personally playing right now called DarthMod.  So, where to start wih this one? You are probably aware by now that the developers of the Total War series, Creative Assembly, have had somewhat of a disaster with their release of Rome 2 and have been patching it constantly ever since. From what I've read(not having played that game) most of the game breaking bugs and failures have been eliminated, but the game itself is still hardly a challenge because of the bad AI programming.  That is pretty much the case with this game, even after a substantial amount of time passed between release and me writing this. The game is still fun as hell, and there will on occasion be a challenging battle or siege where the AI might be competent. Also, the game tends to lag a lot in drawn out battles, even with a powerful processor. As I understand, this was the first game based on the Warscape engine and it seems that the devs at the time did not master it.These are some of the biggest gripes I have with this game, and there is a host of smaller ones. In any case, the game is flawed.  But underneath all the problems and bugs and flaws there is an incredibly engrossing and rich game which takes you to imperial era of the 18th century, giving you access to 3 strategic theaters to wage war, use subterfuge, develop your resources and loads of other activities. You will build powerful armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery with which to conquer, mighty fleets of warships to control the seas and protect your trade routes or raid your enemies. The naval battles are also a hell of a lot of fun once you get used to the wind mechanics and how to fire your cannons. I strongly recommend reading a guide on naval battles if you are unfamiliar with how sailing ships work.   All of this adds up to a very good, if inconsistent, experience. But you know what's better? Having a grand experience all the way through. If you are willing, check out DarthMod and possibly some of the submods for it. It makes the game what it was supposed to be from the start, improving the AI substantially and actually making almost every battle a real challenge. It doesn't fix some of the core game problems with the engine and due to improved graphics it can lag a bit on slower computers, but if you can run it, get it ASAP. Be warned though, it is tough. Campaign AI is much more aggressive and willing to maneuver to get what it wants, and the battle AI for naval battles will seem like Satan at first because of the maneuvers it pulls.  tl/dr: Great game, even better with mods.  
3969	1	a	It's like Civilization, but you actually get to command how your troops fight; kinda like every nation is a militaristic conquesting empire.  WHAT I DID LIKE:  I really enjoy this game, there's nothing more exhiliarating than 17th and 18th century combat where people would stand in ranks and shoot at the enemy (people who have the balls to do that are respected by me).   There are many ways to go at your opponent in terms of strategy and many units are available from many nations to further increase your customization.  Managing your empire, which includes: putting down rebellions, trading with other nations, researching war technologies, assassinating an enemy's agent, or even bribing others to get what you want, is a vast and immersive part of the game I really do like.  WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:  There are a few framerate issues if you stay in a battle for too long, if you put too many men close together, or if you create too much artillery debris. This isn't a problem with my system, as it was made with modern and top notch parts, but it seems the game can't handle these sorts of things.  Naval combat is wonky. It's not too fun and I usually skip it if I can.  Sometimes it can be very can to negotiate with nations for trade access if they keep counteroffering with a demand of money and a few of your technologies.    I give Empire: Total War a 7/10.   Buy it if it's on sale or if you want a more military oriented version of Civilization. I've really had some fun with this title, see if you will too.
3971	1	a	Very Addictive but can become boring after a while.
243	0	a	Most terrible total war ive ever played.   Seriously the cavalry AI and the infantry AI is sooo dumb  do not buy this game
244	0	a	Graphical issues render game unplayable.. Campaign map lag:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?edit=vd&amp;v=_U92W-yzo2c   there are also broken shadows in battle map as well as the campaign map.... only solution really - is to turn off shadows -_- So, for ONCE AGAIN, getting my hopes up, taking my money and letting me down: -5/10 Don't buy.
3973	1	a	the best total war so far 
3975	1	a	Love it!!! 
3977	1	a	i hightly recommand this :) Best one i play control and others maybe hard but you'll get use to it :)
3979	1	a	brilliant game, hours of fun and i would reccomend it to anyone! you should have a pretty decent computer to run it well though
3981	1	a	Basically this game and me have a love hate relationship. The AI is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The Sige wall lag bug can ruin what should be epic battles. Otherwise it is fun. I have over 100 hours on this account and on my other account which is locked to to Steam not appreciating my racial humor had over 300. Worth buying on sale. Never a bad choice of youre bored.
3983	1	a	how do u stop the lag
3985	1	a	Best total war game yet
3987	1	a	Took over the whole of the Netherlands and Great Britian in only 10 years with France.   10/10 would detroy two nations again!
3989	1	a	The campaign is excellent, but the battles are worse because of a bad AI
3991	1	a	This is hands down the best total war game of all time.  Naval battles are amazing (♥♥♥♥ the haters) cruising with a fleet with first rates and epic naval battles is all you could hope for in a total war game; smoke, fire explosions - true epicness. The melee units on the game however like calvalry are fairly disappointing but having cannons, mortars and ranks upon ranks of infantry makes the games land battles superb.  The campaign map is nothing special but the feeling you get from building a vast empire is un rivaled by other total wars   Deffiantly buy this game, brilliant.
3993	1	a	Playes as the Dutch conqured india lost amsterdam became indian state with my new capital of ceylon. 10/10 would be Dutch Indian empire again
3995	1	a	Obliterated 3 nations within the frist 5 min of game . 10/10 Would obliterate again .
3997	1	a	Really awesome game! So addictive!
3999	1	a	This game hard. It takes alot of time to get to know everything about it. But after you put the hours in... You'll enjoy it.
4001	1	a	*Be polish ᕦ(òóˇ)ᕤ *Invades Prussia (｡◕‿‿◕｡) *Austria declares war ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°) *I own Prussia ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) *Everyone declares war against me ( ͡■ ͜ʖ ͡■) *Give them ♥♥♥♥in' good kicking ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ﾉ■-■
4003	1	a	You play with soldiers and boats 10/10
4005	1	a	Total crap. The only reason I still have this is that it is bound to my steam account. Do not buy it for any reason.
247	0	a	The reason for my downgrade is simple, you can buy Napoleon, much better and less bugs.
4007	1	a	-Becomes British -First campaign -Builds army -Recruits navy -Goes to areas around Nassau -Declares war on Spain -Takes over Spanish terretories in the colonies -XD -Spain takes them back -FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU -Start advancing troops to take over America -Successful -Forgot two reigons -Sighns peace treaty -Asks for military access -Takes over one of the two reigons -Sighn peace again (Stupid americans XD) -At this point im dieing of laughter -Destroy nation  10/10 Would decive the americans like the French again.
4009	1	a	One of the best games you get to create your own battle! You get to be kinda like a general in this game! you like history get this game
248	0	a	Do not buy it. Have wasted hours playing it three times each time to have it crash 50 years in before game end. Impossible to avoid a freeze of the AI. Using previous saves still results in the AI freezing at said turn. Total War should be ashamed for releasing this without a patch to fix such. And yes I have looked about for one. Buy something decent. MBU
4011	1	a	Still playing it 8 years after release. Last game I got hooked on in the series.
4013	1	a	You can be the Swedish Empire and prevent the Russian Empire from happening Best game ever I rate it Carolus Rex/10
4015	1	a	You can replay scenes from Patriot. 18/18
4017	1	a	BRILL GAME MUST HAVE 
4019	1	a	i learn about europe and america more than in classroom
4021	1	a	great game
4023	1	a	love this game
4025	1	a	despite playing numerous campaigns they all end up very different and new experince   however i will say that the ai can be a tad stupid at times (not always) but overall great addition to franchise   only minor grub i have is that you can't conquer africa, austrailia etc... but india and north america are still great additions in the right direction
4027	1	a	Great game
4029	1	a	It really good
4031	1	a	This is a Great Game for the Patient Mind.
4033	1	a	It really good
4035	1	a	Started as Austria, attacked Russia and won. I am the greatest nation and will conquest all of the world-Austrian King
4037	1	a	Worth it, im not very good at the sea battles, but the rest of the game is awesome.
4039	1	a	good game I love the different units I would also recomend Europa Universalis 4
4041	1	a	Became prussia, Followed the tutorial that said Take over west prussia i did, I took over west prussia took my troops out Poland attacked west prussia with like 1000 troops, I had 480 armed citizens, I defended West Prussia. rip Poland lost everything to Prussian Empire, fix Poland and I now have an Alliance (Since they are still to strong, but I did take over their Protecorates, because they were still at war with me) Now I march towards Denmark
4043	1	a	I love building empires in the this. The global aspect of the game makes this total war version much better than the previous ones... at least in my opinion. Diplomacy still sucks in this game though, absolutely no one wants to trade even though it helps their economy too...
4045	1	a	great game
4047	1	a	You can be the Swedish Empire and prevent the Russian Empire from happening Best game ever I rate it Carolus Rex/10
4049	1	a	You can replay scenes from Patriot. 18/18
4051	1	a	'Shoot straight ya ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!' That saying pretty much summarizes the whole style of warfare which is seen in this astonishing game.This is one of CA more ambitious title for its time going for the traditional melee combat to 'modern warfare'  In this game you can choose between multiple factions including of course the more traditional one such as the French or British.However,less common factions which unique warfare tactics are also available like the Ottomans for example with its fearsome sword bearing janissaries or the Marathas deploying its heavy cavalry.  To sum it all up the game is great and a must have for any war fanatic. 
4053	1	a	I'm surprised I've held off on saying something about this game for so long.  I don't really know what to say. Empire: Total War is just awesome. I still keep coming back to it, and I refer to it a lot as one of my favourite strategy games of all time. People like Civ 5, I like Empire. I mean, don't get me wrong, Civ 5 is not bad. You can play it with friends, too, and on top of that it never really crashes.  Empire, on the other hand, has rather deep combat. Or at least, deeper than just saying, 'hey, you, hit this thing' and then watching that thing hit that other thing.  I really enjoy the fact that quality can win over quantity. And I like the fact that you can play as Prussia. And I like the fact that this is a very, very interesting game - right clicking on any unit in the game, or even pretty much any building in the game will tell you it's in-game function, a brief history, and then possible some other interesting trivia about it, in that order, every time. And I love this. It's fascinating to learn about the 1700s while playing a game.  I just have a lot of fun in this game taking over the world as various factions. There's also some great mods for this game, and Empire, in my opinion, marks the last game before Creative Assembly really started to go downhill... Shogun 2 was pretty alright though.
251	0	a	Broken garbage. Installed for a matter of hours before grand campaign games could no longer be started or loaded, I was worried about this happening because of numerous problem reports around this game but went ahead and bought the package deal over the weekend it was on sale. Now I like many other good folks am left asking questions about how to fix my game only to get the same old BS 'delete you user script/preferences/creative assembly folder' line that DOES NOTHING!!! REFUND PLEASE.  And you wonder why people pirate so many games. Disgusting.
4055	1	a	I like this game (hence the hours I have played) but I have to be honest it's an enjoyable but ultimately a flawed game.   There are better Total War games in the franchise.   This game has so much unfufilled potential.   What really holds this game back is it is unfinished.  This games works better for me when it is modded.   I recomend you look at this review   Why Empire total war failed a review by Reynold Sanity  
4057	1	a	Why does everyone hate this/batter this to no end? Ok, there may have been bugs on launch, but the patches fixed them, so now it's actually playable. Get an unlock all factions mod and you're set.
4059	1	a	It's a history lesson at its finest.
4061	1	a	'Shoot straight ya ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!' That saying pretty much summarizes the whole style of warfare which is seen in this astonishing game.This is one of CA more ambitious title for its time going for the traditional melee combat to 'modern warfare'  In this game you can choose between multiple factions including of course the more traditional one such as the French or British.However,less common factions which unique warfare tactics are also available like the Ottomans for example with its fearsome sword bearing janissaries or the Marathas deploying its heavy cavalry.

4063	1	a	A lot of fun, some nations are far more challenging. Advancing in tech is fun and is awesome when you overtake other nations in certian tech, but you can also sell tech to help with the constant need for more $$$, especially when at war (which is almost constant with someone). Fun to expand to other continents and to fight wars all over the world. A.I is sneeky, treacherous and sometimes overly aggresive and often unreasonabe in negotiation.   -Graphics are great, and manageing your nation is fun  -A.I battle tactics land and sea are fairly smart and challenging but not impossible  -Really fun battles but massive opposition forces make it time consuming for conquest. Rewarding when you have more wealth and security   -Bankrupting rival economies causes rebellion in their lands and can bring the existence of new nations friendly to you and can buffer you from hostile nations. (AWESOME!)
4065	1	a	You can be the Swedish Empire and prevent the Russian Empire from happening Best game ever I rate it Carolus Rex/10
4067	1	a	this game is amazing the naval battles are what got me but the rest is just as impressive. DarthMOD is a must for sure adds better musket sounds better smoke, ai tweaks, more units ect ect.
4069	1	a	For some reason the Spanish version was downloaded....disappointed.
4071	1	a	The combination of grand strategy on the map and detailed battles is just perfect. Almost every game of Total War series is pretty good. Highly recommend this one because the background setting is from 1700-1800 which is the most wonderful times in the war history. Seven years war (which can be considered the 'first' world war) and later the French Revolution.
4073	1	a	Brilliant game.Play this on Darth Mod &lt;3
4075	1	a	I agree with most of the positive comments. One of the better games of the series.
4077	1	a	Took over the whole world playing as the Russians. 10/10 Would make my own Soviet Union again Stalin would be proud.
256	0	a	First of this is a long review but this is nothing but the truth about this game. I saw empire and i am kinda new to the total war franchise. i saw total war empire and i thought it would be a pretty decent game. I look up reviews on the game and sadly i saw a lot of hate. Now that was a long time ago and it has been a couple years since the game came out so i thought i would give it a go hoping all the bugs would be patched. I was wrong....... The game is a mess still after all these years! I thought they would fix the AI and all the bugs but nope! The AI are awful just a disaster. The AI run straight and run away from your troops and dont even attack. I spent an one hour playin ghtis game and I had to quit because the battle were so boring. I think the civil war is awesome and really cool but not like this when all the troops wont even attack and im standing there with one unit and still win the war because the army doesnt attack me.  Next the game is so bad it hurts to play the game. The map is a wreck, you get so much men to start out with so you can take over the cities right next to you and demolish them like no problem if they even let you blow down the doors since the cannons dont like moving after you shoot something and decide to shoot a hill instead of moving and attack the gates. The gameplay is so basic on the campaign map and doesnt give you those heart pounding moments like you have on medieval 2 or shogun 2. You start out with like 5 alliances and those alliances wont even help you. Instead they will just sit back while im getting my ♥♥♥ kicked by the french. I signed a treaty with you to help me not sit around and watch my city fall to some other faction you are also fighting! Next when you get higher in level it takes five hours just for all the factions to take there turns. Ive watched youtube more then i was playing the game waiting for my turn to come.  The concept is great rewriting history and not let america gain its independance or ally with america as the british and go crazy and fight the british or something. I was impressed with how much they gave a lot of detail on the battle grounds with the little stuff like rocks all over the place, broken down walls for your men to take cover behind while there firing bullets, forests to hide and set up ambushed and flanks on the enemy. The total war series does a fantastic job with units and how many units there are and how you can get some epic fights that take a long time like how it was back then. Sadly this game is missing so much that im actually sad that this is my first total war game i didnt like. I am still a big total war fan and will get all the games but empire was so bad and were missing so many key factors to make this game a good game and instead made this bad and not fun to play. Get shogun 2 or medieval 2 and lets hope that they will make a fun civil war game. Hope they do great concept just bad game. Ill be waiting sega! Make medevil 3 first ;)
257	0	a	This game has potential but has so many problems that I can not recommend it. It is mared with freezing and slowdowns, but the random crashes make it unplayable. Do not give these Aholes your money.
258	0	a	This is a long, long, long, drawn out game. I can see many weeks being sunk into one campaign. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I was quite enjoying playing it.  Downside?  Well, I can't play it anymore. Constantly crashes on load up EVERY time I open it. I've tried all the fixes I can find online. Nothing works. Beginning the process of getting a refund. Save yourself the trouble and give this one a miss.
259	0	a	'Units can you please shoot the native americans scalping you from the flank? Maybe stab them or something? No?' And then I lost
260	0	a	used to love the game until I got windows 10 now it wont play and cant find a fix
261	0	a	This game is a major disappointment. It has a large number of bugs, some of which break the game in a way that will not allow you to progress further into the game. I highly recommend that if you play this game you make sure that you have about 5 save in order to avoid having to start the game all over again. I would not recommend buying this game for anything over $5 and even that is a little to much to pay. It would have been better if this game had workshop.
262	0	a	I played 66 hours of this game and I highly don't recommend this game. This game has issues like crashes, bugs, and dumb A.I. The game, I believe, is an open beta game where the graphics are crap and lags for no reason(I have a very good computer that can run game on high graphics). If you really want to buy this game I highly recommend on buying total war shogun 2 where as the game is a lot more stable and has extremely less bugs and crashes. Also, buy this game on a deal so you don't have to regret on spending 20 dollars.   update: i forgot to mention after 7 years of this game's release, IT'S STILL BROKEN.
263	0	a	Still crashes at random to this day. Different computer, still crashes.
4079	1	a	Pretty cool...anything you would expect from 18th century warfare I would recemmend getting 'Minor factions revenge' great mod. Darth mod sucks alot. If you want proof play it.
266	0	a	By far the worst total war game.   The ablity to recruit gun units and artillery seems moot when you consider the fact that you will win most battles in this game (on hard I might add) with Cavalry and bows and arrows.  Also... the voice acting is horrible, bordering on racist, but remains about the only thing that actually gave me a reaction other than bordem in this game.   Buy something good.  
267	0	a	This is not a good TW game at all. It is buggy and straight up unfun.
4081	1	a	Very enjoyable game, great fun. Features great singleplayer. One issue is that fortress combat seems a little... broken, and naval battles can be a little clunky, but apart from that, solid game.
4083	1	a	It's Total War, a genre of its own. If you like strategy, Empire is a must buy. :)
4085	1	a	Steam features a wide variety of games, and Empire: Total War is no exception.  Play as an 18th century superpower, or pick America and pretend to be relevant; expand your overseas colonies, wrestle for control of the seas, and hope your game doesn't crash when you click the End Turn button. The possibilities are literally endless.
4087	1	a	Awesome game just get darthmod it makes it even more awesome
4089	1	a	Ok... I know that it got a bit of a slating by the players and the review but come on, if you want a fun game that you can spend ours on and you like strategy games it is great. It offers 3 theaters of war unlike Napoleon total war and the graffics are good, especially if you are running it on a slow comuter or a laptop. The sieges need to be tweeked so the path of your units doesn't run the wrong way. But on the whole it is a good game.
271	0	a	I only played less then an hour, but the games crashed three times. Unfortunately, this game had a great potential but it doesn't worth it price with all those bugs. Some people said that thoses bugs were fixed with the pastches, but no! After 7 years on the market the game still bugs. Be warned that you may encounter technical issues if you buy it.
272	0	a	This game would be great, if not for all the bugs. Limitless number of bugs that can ruin hours worth of effort put into your campaign. Some fort battles don't work, ai bugs that freezes the game, etc.
273	0	a	down loading the game has created problems having the cd to load has yet again proven its self better down loading from has yet again shown me its a waist of time
274	0	a	The text size is too small I downloaded a bigger text but don't know how to mod it into the game.
4091	1	a	why no mods? cage bunny ANGRY....
275	0	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! GET IT NOW
276	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥
4093	1	a	the hardest game of the total war franchise followed by shogun and rome total war the game is so hard I never play the game because i get my ♥♥♥♥ kicked by native americans which shows how hard this game is.
278	0	a	Excellent gameplay however the game is full of bugs like unresponsive units, units retreating the running forward before they attack, changing formation etc. Even with mods this persists would not recommend this game to anyone.
4095	1	a	Very good game, would be epic if it had multiplayer campaighn but the quick battles are sick.
4097	1	a	This is an amazing game I highly recommend this game to everyone especialy to the fans of the total war seriers, graphics are beautiful on high settings and gameplay is perfect.
279	0	a	Terrible terrible game, bugs make it unplayable glad i bought it on sale burned less money.
280	0	a	Very Positive, you're friggin kidding me.   I remember this when it was released years ago, that this game was VERY buggy at the time, 7 years later and some game-breaking bugs still EXIST.  One of this, is the notorius save game corrupt bug that i just experienced. When you get far in the game, 50 turns+, there is a danger that the your save games WILL GET CORRUPTED. This happens without warning, if you seat down for long sessions, and just save save save and save, and overwrite previous saves, and don't load back, there is a great danger that you will lose a lot of progress.   You will only notice then in your next session, that you can't load anymore anymore any of your save games. They will just cause the game to crash to the desktop.  What happens when the game starts corrupting the save games, all saves you do after that point will also get corrupted, so there is a chance you wont know it, and you will need to go a long way back.  I read the in forums of several people experiencing this, and its pretty common, and some can't finish the game, because they get stuck in a neverending corrupt-reload-go back loop.  So please let this be a warning, so if you are going to play, backup regularly, or dont' overwrite your save games. 
281	0	a	Now let me start this review by saying that I do not hate this game. I don't. I think its naval combat is very nice, and I do like watching musket barrages tear through my enemy's line infantry like a cavalry saber through a poor infantryman's head.  This being said... the game fails in almost every other capacity, even with Darthmod, I find it the most dull of any Total War. Throughout all Total War (besides the newer ones, although Shogun 2 is the sole exception of them) the games managed to make interesting announcements, fun agents to play with, bloody diverse battles, and intense strategy. None of that is here. The announcer is no longer there, the battles are dull and silent except for the droning pathetic whine of their failure of a soundtrack, the ceasless cracking of muskets, and the droning clatter of drum beats, and to top it all off, the soldiers are all clones. We haven't seen that since ♥♥♥♥ing ROME. What the hell? Of course the Warscape engine destroys this game, collision? Not a thing. Blood? Nope. Generals? They mean nothing. Agents? Might aswell not have them.  The game's AI is pathetic, its battles are dull and meaningless, and all the soldiers feel disgusting and stupid and WRONG. You just don't care about your people. I mean maybe if there were some mods that add an announcer, add more battle sounds, blood maybe, unit model variety, but this game on its own, or with Darthmod alone? Is not very fun.  5.5/10 What the hell CA? How can you fall from Medieval... to this.
282	0	a	The game itself is a lot of fun; unfortunately I am unable to complete a single campaign without getting to a point where ending the turn crashes the game. Loading previous saves yields the same result. Just can't recommend a game with such fundamental issues. 15+ hours invested into a campaign only to be unable to progress 3 years from victory.
283	0	a	Freezes up after a few hours, after searching the web found out extended games are impossible because other nations will get too big and freeze the AI or something. Not cool.
4099	1	a	This game has the most biggest map when it comes to the realistic setting because you can fight in india, europe, and america
284	0	a	The ai in this game acts so barbaric it's not even funny, at the end on my first or second turn multiple nations declare war on me for no reason whatsoever, managing money in this game is pretty tought to especially if your at war with multiple nations who delcare war on you for no reason.
4101	1	a	a very good classic stratagy game xD 
4103	1	a	A great game, It was unfortunately hindered by bugs and performance issues, At first. Now it's patched up and ready to go!.
286	0	a	Tried it, can’t really get into it.
287	0	a	Great game but i cant finish a game without it ♥♥♥♥ing up...give me my money back! I had to dl it more then twice
4105	1	a	WHAT A GREAT GAME THIS GAME IS.
290	0	a	Way overpriced and the multiplayer is completley broken for Mac, i can't connect to any other server that is hosted on a different OS. (A.K.A. All of them)
291	0	a	worst game of 2014
4107	1	a	Just install DarthMod and you will be A-Okay! :D Seriously it fixes the whole game... :D
292	0	a	I like this game, but I would not recommend it.  The game for the most part takes place during the mid 1700s to early 1800s, when muskets were weapon of choice for armies, when the golden age of sail was reaching its peak, and European nations had vast colonial empires that stretched across the globe. You control a major nation during this time and it's your job to lead it to glory, generally by crushing anyone who tries to pick a fight with you. The world is yours to conquer, and it is a very large world indeed.  And yet despite how awesome that sounds, this is not a good game. For a tactics game, the AI strategy for most games kind of sucks. Rather than take advantage of terrain like they did in previous Total War games, the AI will almost always charge you head on. And on my computer whenever there was a large battles the game would tend to chug like anrexic train going uphill. If you have a modern gaming rig, you *might* not have the same trouble I did but even then I wouldn't bet on it.  And the combat map designs are kind of lazy. It doesn't matter what part of the globe you're fighting on, because chances are you'll be fighting on the same square of 1700th century farm land with MAYBE a palette swap of the ground textures. This is real shame because in previous Total War games they had meticulous detailed combat maps.  However the one saving grace of this game is its naval combat. The ships in this game are gorgeous, with meticulous detail put into every ship model. And there are a lot of ships, from bomb ketches, to the first rates, and even steam ships later in the game. Naval combat revolves primariy around using the wind to your advantage and either destroying enemy ships with regular cannon balls or crippling so you can board and capture them. Here seems to be where all the brains for the AI went, because it will actually use tactics.   However even the naval combat will not be for everyone. For one thing it requires and intense ammount of micro managing. Every single ship will need to be repositioned at some point. And in order to use some the abilities that will turn the tide, you need to take control of each ship one at a time to activate them. Personally I liked the challenge, but I've heard from others that they found it to be a pain in the ♥♥♥.  So for me personally, I have a love hate relationship with this game (in that I hate that I love it) but I would recommend virtually any other Total War game over this one.
4109	1	a	just another well done total war game
4111	1	a	There boys!! Bring her about!!
4113	1	a	10/10 would play again
4115	1	a	Turtle approved.
4117	1	a	Great game smells normal, and very much like to killz the french... no homo... my name is No, my sign is no, my number is no... Men &lt;3 no homo... ♥♥♥♥♥.
4119	1	a	This game is worth getting. This game is notorious for it's very buggy release. It's been patched a lot, most of the bugs are gone and the game is worth playing.
4121	1	a	0/10 for Empire Total War, 10/10 for DarthMod Empire. Get the mod or you're not playing the real game.
4123	1	a	Because Empire !  But if you really want to know what we can do in this game, here's a short list :  - Remove Kebab ! - Make America great again ! - The French will run away ! (100% realistic) - Even with mighty canon, Poland cannot into space !  Bayonet always win, best geopolitical simulator with a lot of democracy, not like fake modern European countries !   I should recommend to everyone if not full of bug, but I will do it anyway ! 10/10, would corrupt savefiles and backup at the same time again !
296	0	a	What could in theory have been a great game instead was just another game with terrible AI removing any reason to play it single player for anyone looking for an interesting experience. Atleast it's amusing to paint the map your colour as Indians. Take that Great Britain.
4125	1	a	How am I writing a review for this. I don't own this game. Good job steam. So yeah, I'll reccomend it, not that I've ever played it.
4127	1	a	&gt;be le me  &gt;be playing this le game &gt;something le epoc happens  haha 10/10  add me on ♥♥♥♥♥
304	0	a	Good potential to be the greatest strategy game of the decade but it's not that good. The game keeps crashing, white screens, savegames don't work (it's awful when the game crashes after the end of the turn and you have to go back 10 turns because autosave doesn't work).  it's a shame because the game has many factions that you can play and big maps but it's not more than a beta version. it's more complex than Napoleon total war, but Napoleon total war was well made.   if you must pay more than 5 €/$ for it, i don't recomend it.
305	0	a	I hate to say but most likely the worst Total War. Most epic scale but poorly optimized from my experiance.
306	0	a	I'm revisiting this game after taking a break for a couple years and now I remember why I stopped. This game should be pretty awesome.   Pros: It's one of the few strategy / RTS games that tackle this time period and specifically focus on the American revolution. Despite what others say, the units make sense since there was lots of a trade and conquering - you should have the ability to have the same technology through and through. Also, if it wasn't balanced, the British would just win every game. But...  CONS: So many. This game is broken. First off, the improvements are largely annoying and require 10 minutes of reading to figure out what they do. The AI will randomly declare war on you which is just not realistic, a common mistake in strategy games. Advisors/scientists/agents etc are a good idea but in this case they don't clearly do much of anything, window dressing. Including India etc but then completely ignoring Africa (probably out of political correctness) - seriously though, the colonies wouldn't exist the way they did without that trade route, even as horrific as it was. But colonists can magically sail to India - right!  You could look past all of this and just do battle and have a great time. That's if the battle system worked. The AI on both sides is laughable. Most of the time they sit around. Even your units that you order, they just sit there. Sometimes if they are engaged, they will stop and just get slaughtered. Sometimes an enemy will run through their lines (in retreat) and they just sit there. Like ' oh, that's weird, there goes the enemy, oh well'. Often the enemy will just sit out in no where or in side castle and not do anything. You could be winning and your army will lose confidence and run away. You could masterfully out maneuver a powerful enemy and you should win but then you don't because your guys that are winning get scared???   This should be a 2.99 game. Or they could fix it but it's probably too late. I recall the early Total War games being a lot more solid.  
4129	1	a	Does anybody want to join the 3rd Kentucky on Mount and Blade: North and South? Just add Me, Hardcase726 and add Musickman101 on steam then message our Colonel and Youtube Celeb Musickman101, and tell him that you want to join and that Hardcase726 sent you. See you on the Battlefield! 
4131	1	a	this... is... just... awesome :D
317	0	a	I quit playing after I conquered all of western Europe as Prussia in 50 years. The game is too easy and you can't play as any small, weak nations like Bavaria or Westphalia to make it more challenging (the have mods for it though). If you want to buy a game like this look somewhere else there are plenty of other good games. Unless you're looking for battle simulation, then this game is good for you. If you do want battle simulation don't by this game specifically though as they have other games that were made more recently. I prefer grand strategy empire building fun with ACTUAL challenges. 4/10
318	0	a	I have found it impossable to give a good review about this game. Battle mechanics are fun and the factions are cool. There are only 2 things i find bad about this game. However they are big issues. The second biggest problem is bugs and graphics. The graphics are Trash. with people looking like it was animated 10 year old and people sliding instead of walking like magic everywhere. The biggest problem is mac and Pc gamers cant play together. with most players wanting purely multiplayer action to prove there metal or plain fun. I feel like Total War treats mac players who paid just as much unfairly. Why cant this game be cross platform? Rome 2 is so we know it possiable. just put the time and effort on these issues and you will have so many more players/customers and less bad reviews.
4133	1	a	It's okay I guess
4135	1	a	make it cheaper very fun on dah guest pass
4137	1	a	Very good strategy game. Love the time preiod. AI can be abit average at times.
4139	1	a	Great game, especially with Darthmod, recomended if you like Total war games. If not familiar to how the old total war games work, it wouldn't take you long tob get used to it. I really want an Total War: Empire II please CA, because the era, theaters, and main consept would be amazing to see again with a new engine.
4141	1	a	One of the best Total War games. Had the game way before buying on steam. If you like Total War games, forget Rome, Shogun, Rome 2 and other new ones. Get this one and have endless hours of fun.
4143	1	a	Its good game however the industrial age never really clicked with me. Still a good game to play in your past time.
343	0	a	Riddled with bugs. Savegames corrupted constantly. Idiotic unit pathing. After 5 years they still haven't fixed this ♥♥♥♥?
344	0	a	You can download it on mac but u cant play multiplayer whith windows users and there are only few mac users so u cant almost never play multiplayer if u dont have friend with mac so- IF YOU HAVE MAC DO NOT BUY THIS GAME COSE YOU CAN ONLY PLAY SINGLE but it is pritty cool game and it is my fault i have mac and not normal PC as everybody esle but if u did the same mistake and bought mac do not download this game thanks
345	0	a	UPDATED REVIEW: After playing this game further, I have better reason and judgment as to why one should not purchase Empire: Total War.  Let me begin by stating that I love Medieval II: Total War. It is by far one of my favorite games of all time. I purchased Empire thinking that it would be a logical upgrade from Medieval II. I was immediately disappointed by the extremely long loading times, both when booting up the game and launching or loading a campaign. I intially thought this was due to my laptop's admittedly-low-quality specs, but was reassured that this was a problem within the game itself when it persisted on my desktop, which can run Battlefield 3 on the highest settings and maintain a steady 60 fps. I was then further angered by the unreasonably low amount of playable factions, especially in comparison to the large amount of unplayable factions.   When in a campaign, unlike Medieval II, one must govern the farm, port, town, and city of a region. For example, the city and region may be Magdeburg, which may also have a small town, farm, and port. All of which have individual troops and buildings to manage. This becomes incredibly intricate and annoying to manage as your empire grows to encompass much of Europe, India, and the Americas. The troops and buildings cost an incredible amount of money to purchase and maintain, and the amount of money you can earn is low in comparison. Like Civilization, one must research technologies to progress through the game correctly. These take a tedious amount of time. If you slack or forget at any point in your campaign to research a new technology, you will almost immediately be left in the dust by your AI enemies. Speaking of AI, the AI factions of Empire have no sense of diplomacy whatsoever, especially when compared to the nonplayable factions of Medieval II. They'll go to war with you simply because you share a border, and will end a truce or alliance a turn after it is made. Total annihilation is the only fate for any faction in this game.   Graphically, the campaign map is awful. It ditches the semi-satellite-image style of Medieval II, and tries to portray a tapestry or painting globe. This style fails, and ruins any seriousness that the game's campaign has. Also, the in-game text is terribly small! I have 20-20 vision, and can barely read the in-game tips, notifications, and other text. The battles, however, are very nice compared to Medieval II. The particle and weather effects are upgraded heavily, and soldier models have a lot more fidelity. Battlegrounds and scenes are a lot more varied and detailed.   The mechanics for battles are essentially the same as Medieval II, but Empire is the first in the series to introduce naval battles. Do not expect an Assassin's Creed IV experience. These naval battles are incredibly difficult and clunky. It's a lot of fun to witness AI battles, but to actually commandeer a fleet is too daunting and annoying to enjoy.  All in all, if you're looking for a first taste of the Total War series, or want to relieve what the series was like in its earlier days, do not purchase this game. It ditches the realism of Napoleon and simplicity of Medieval II, and falls flat on delivering any sort of strategic or fun experience.   Seriously, just play Medieval II.   OLD REVIEW:   As are most Total War games, this is a must-have for RTS and simulation fans. However, if you are a fan of Medieval II as I am, you'll find this game takes a bit getting used to, and is not as good as M2. For starters, the map and map style are not as realistic, ditching the photorealism for a revolutionary-era styled artsy map. This heavily effects the quality of the game, as you feel like you're playing a Total War variation of Civilization Revolution. Also, just like civilization, Empire introduces technology research, which incredibly slows the pace by which you play. Because of this, the play style in the campaign is almost nowhere near how you would play Medieval II or games prior. But, these are nearly counter-balanced by the shear map size and number of playable factions. All of Europe and North America are conquerable, as well as India and some parts of Africa and South America. Coastland Asia, Oceania, and other parts of Africa and merely used as trade posts.   One element that ruins this, however, is how irrational and warmongering the NPC factions are. Almost all of your neighbors will end up going to war with you, no matter how much you try diplomacy, appeasing, or just plain being an isolationist. Just like Civilization, a country will swoop in and take your provinces without any warning, and the game's economic system will force you to spend a terrible amount of turns preparing armies before you can actually defend yourself.   Basically, this is Total War: Civilization. If that suits you, go ahead and buy it. I'll stick with Medieval II.
346	0	a	Honestly, for a guy who's starting to getting into the whole Total war series thanks to Medieval 2, This is by far, besides Rome 2 which I do not own but imagine I will in the future, the worst Total war game I have ever played. I honestly felt having more fun with Napoleon Total war than this game because while that game is technically just this game in Europe, at least the game kinda felt more fun than this game is. The music in Empire Total war is pretty bland, the game play is boring. The only thing I like about this is that you could play as the Native Americans if you own the DLC which is worth 10 dollars (not worth it). Stay away from this game, I honestly think the hype on this game is total B.S.
347	0	a	My least favorite Total War. I only say don't get it because you should get another Total War game instead: Medieval II, Shogun 2, or Rome II. If you like strategy games at all, you simply must play one of those because they are all great single player games with amazing depth.
348	0	a	The AI hilariously runs in circles and refuses to attack you in battles. The time it takes to progress a single turn is unbearable. I wish this game was good, but it's not. Get Napoleon. Get any other total war game, just not this one unless you want to spend more time laughing and watching enemy units do the stupidest things imaginable against your army as you effectivelly give up on tactics and just bumrush them because it's more convinient and takes less time - not like you'll lose any units anyway.
4145	1	a	'The Patriot' AKA :Empire: Total War™' is a fictional 2000 American historical war film directed by Roland Emmerich, written by Robert Rodat, and starring Mel Gibson, Chris Cooper, and Heath Ledger. It was produced by the Mutual Film Company and Centropolis Entertainment and was distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film mainly takes place in rural York County, South Carolina, and depicts the story of an American swept into the American Revolutionary War when his family is threatened. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on four real American Revolutionary War heroes: Andrew Pickens, Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan and Thomas Sumter.
363	0	a	Oh boy, a total war game based in the most idiotic era of war... I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys an 'AI' that acts more like an enthusiastic pre-schooler than a seasoned general; baffling empire-wide micromanaging; game-breaking glitches; and just all-around mediocre-ness. At first, I was really excited to play this game. But the fun had just about totally evaporated by the time I had spent a mind-boggling 10 HOURS trying to beat the PROLOGUE. By the time I gave up on that and started the 'Grand Campaign', I just couldn't find the game's brain-dead battle AI and breathtaking glitches appealing anymore. When this game is looked back on 10 years from now, it will be compared with the likes of classics like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. However- there is arguably some fun to be had in free battle. Having masses of hapless enemy soldiers charging into a wall of bullets, etc. - Final Review Score- a sloppy 3.5/10. If you want a Total War game with guns, maybe you should try Fall of the Samurai.
364	0	a	This game looked so good, but it kept crashing. In the end i had to refund ;( sorry developers
365	0	a	Greetings to every future member of the chat rooms of blurry text and other unsolved problems! =)  It is a shame that so many people paid money for this strategic cake, but are not able to enjoy it. (I really tried to like it and to play it, but instead most of the play time comes from the try to fix the problems that came with the last patches)  On some PCs (my very new one included) the text is so blurry in all possible graphic configurations, it gives you a headache and makes the game unplayable. There is no problem solving until today, but there are a lot of threads with very friendly people where this problem is discussed (just look in the forum of steam for text issues or search your browser for blurry text empire).  So if you want to join the club, just pay the price here in the shop and you are maybe the next one that doesn't get a playable game, but contact with very friendly people. From this point of view it is really not expensive.^^  (I couldn't think about Empire being broken and never fixed, since I have no problem with other TW titles (Medieval II and Shogun 2). But I can just review my own experience and in this context I want to welcome all new members in the Empire chatrooms for frustrated people) cu
366	0	a	This game looked so good, but it kept crashing. In the end i had to refund ;( sorry developers
367	0	a	Crashes to Desktop too much and there is no solutino online and when you contact SEGA they will not respond. Terrible Product and terrible customer service
368	0	a	it's a fun game but it doesn't save my game for some reason, i'll push save and it won't
369	0	a	Mass gun fights and total war don't mix well, in my view. The worst of the series.
4147	1	a	The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. 
381	0	a	Ottoman Empire's turn took over my computer for 30mins plus it is one of the worst total war games. This game is old and it sucks.
382	0	a	Worst AI I've ever seen in a game, if you try attacking the enemys, your soldiers will just stand there, and watch the like 2 soldiers that actually try to attack die. This game is really bad, I'll take my refund now
383	0	a	DO NOT BUY! Game is BROKEN. The game is designed to be run in 1280x1024 resolution. Anyone playing with a more standard resolution (1600x900, 1440x900, 1366x768 ect) will experience BLURRY text. Enough to make your eyes hurt after only 2 minutes. It is a game breaker. There is NO solution to this problem, and there never will be. DO NOT BUY. NOT worth any amount of money. A shame too, the game itself is pretty good, but the blurry text makes it unplayable. Anyone out there who wears glasses or contacts: Imagine not having them and going about your day without them. Constantly having to SQUINT to see anything. This is what ETW is like, except squinting does not help. Nothing does. A fundamental game flaw. A great game ruined by one simple dev mistake.
384	0	a	okay for i begin i want to say this first when i bought empire it was really fun to play but after a few weeks it started to get boring.  in 1 battle you have seen all the kill animations and al the battles are pretty much the same you line up your troops and the anemy runs towards you after a couple of battles you have seen everything. if you want to buy a totat war game i recommend shogun 2 or shogun 2 fall of the samurai but if you are looking for a cheaper total war i prefere napoleon
385	0	a	I love this game don't get me wrong but it has flaws and pros the AI is damn near impossible to make agreements with (they wanted my land) like if your a huge nation then they will make relations easier but if you arent then prepare for hell  8/10
386	0	a	Still has bugs , A LOT OF BUGS , unless you install darth mod.All we wanted was a Hearts of Iron world map like , set in 17th century that had the Napoleon TW latest patches added to it.  5/10 Great game for its time , except it had more bugs at launch. 
4149	1	a	Ah the good old days before CA REALLY started cutting content and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wallets. Tech trees, a good list of countries to play and you can be Russia :D  Still a few small bugs but it was all downhill after this....
443	0	a	game always sticks after about 300 turns....tried and wasted a lot of time on it
444	0	a	its crap do not buy it it is not worth 20$ more like 1$ the gameplay is crap units turn to pixels
4151	1	a	this has NOTHING to do with Harry Potter!!!
446	0	a	It really sucks that they for some reason left out the campaign multiplayer.
447	0	a	Tally-ho and all that good stuff. Remarkable game 1/10
448	0	a	I would rather drag my testicles though 70 miles of broken glass and rusty nails than play this game for another 15 minutes.
449	0	a	it wont launch pls fix
450	0	a	to be honest- one of the worst rts games I have ever played. Sound consists of random grunts to unfitting music, textures only sometimes load in, and the gameplay is boring and repetitive. 3/10 at the most.
4153	1	a	Empire: Total War
462	0	a	A deeply flawed game on release, it's become playable, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you pick up a mod such as the excellent 'Darth Mod.' Skip to Napoleon or Shogun II.
463	0	a	While I never experienced this game in it's initial release state I find it hard to believe it could of been much worse than it is now. To start, the vanilla game is simply bland as oatmeal, so mods are a necessity to even enjoy it. The campaign map is horribly, horribly optimized. On high settings with thousands of highly detailed troops on the battlefield the game runs flawlessly, but the campaign map with mostly flat low resolution terrain and a few low-poly models? Barely chugs along at 10 FPS with ungodly amounts of stutter. Pathetic. This combined with the poorly redesigned UI makes doing anything on the campaign map a chore.  The open land battles are this game's only strong point. The engine is capable of handling tens of thousands of troops at once (although you'll never see more than a couple thousand without mods), and it can be quite a spectacle to watch and even somewhat fun to command. Still, sadly CA once again decided that instead of putting effort into making the AI more intelligent on harder difficulties, they went with giving the AI absurd arbitrary melee bonuses on hard and very hard difficulties.  Siege battles however are even more broken than previous titles despite being considerably simplified. Instead of directly defending a walled city you now attack/defend the starforts that surround them (if they've been built). Siege equipment no longer exists, as infantry can simply climb the walls using ropes and cannons can simply destroy the walls from a safe distance. Despite these features the AI can still frequently can get stuck running their troops around just outside the walls getting slaughtered by musket and cannon fire, and troops on the wall can get stuck due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pathfinding. Worst of all though is a critical bug that can happen when a section of wall is destroyed, that causes the game to slow down massively for no apparent reason.  The big new feature of course in Empire was being able to fight naval battles. Unfortunately, despite their cinematic appearence, they are usually more of a hassle to fight than they're worth. This is mostly due to the ship AI of course, that forces you to manually control every ship for any of them to be effective.
464	0	a	Useless game you should just buy medieval 2 total war as it is far better in almost every way- bar the graphics.
465	0	a	The game is full off bugs....dont buy
466	0	a	I cant even play it on my computer
467	0	a	If you want to fight a turn-based stratergy game in the 1700-1800 then play Napoleon Total War instead
468	0	a	Not as fluid as Shogun 2 but still fun to play.
469	0	a	NO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CO-OP / MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGN!!!!!  I bought two copies of this game for the sole purpose of playing co-op campaign with my girlfriend. After we downloaded the whole thing, we learned that Creative Assembly has taken the co-op mode and locked it as some sort of 'beta test'. The only way to get access to this 'beta test' is to Email Sega and beg for one.  So I did. Sega e-mailed me back a week later and told me 'tough luck, we're not giving you an unlock code for the co-op mode'. So basically this game HAS a functional co-op mode, it's just locked up in some steam repository somewhere.  Honestly, I feel pretty ripped off right now. Hopefully this will help someone else avoid the same pitfall.
470	0	a	lacking the co-op campaign.. idk why the beta is not a dlc, really lame..
471	0	a	Very disapointing game the units formation system is completly messed up. Better buy MEdieval 2 than this piece of crap.
472	0	a	Campaign mode is my favorite part of Total War games. Rome 2 comes with a terrible campaign mode. In fact all of their games since Medieval 2 have had a terrible campaign mode. I have Empire and Rome 2 in my library but never play them. I have enjoyed Rome 1 and Medieval 2 but I will never buy another Total War game. I look elsewhere for my turn-based games.
473	0	a	Haven't played the game yet, but if it's anything like STEAM . . . it's going to suck!
474	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game .... i CANNOT reccomend this game. My admiral dies at the beginning of the battle as he drops through the ship. Battle only starts for 2 second and 300/300 person ship becomes 298/300 ... people just randomly drown at start of naval battles. This game sucks and is the main reason i will never preorder a total war garbage from this company. SEGA oR ca ... I can however only reccomend this game if you mod it. I got a mod called 'DarthMod '... it makes this game look like the trailers or a movie. This game as it is ... is garbage, physics is garbage, AI is garbage, sound efffects and music is garbage. It NEEDS this MOD to be even worthy of playing.
475	0	a	The worst total war game. AI is terrible, diplomacy is terrible, the battles are terrible, miusic for battle is very unmotivating. I hope they eventually come out with a second Empire because I like the concept but the game was over all bad.
476	0	a	&gt;Grew up in Maryland &gt;'Chief Cheesepeake'  DONE. COMPLETELY DONE. The game killed all enjoyment in the FIRST mission. I may come back someday, if I can brave the ugly menus and wonky game balance; but most likely, I will probably just stick with Civ5. To be honest, I never really did 'get' the Total War series. It seems to me like a 'love it or hate it' kind of thing. My understanding of the inner nuances of the gameplay is you take your guys and you run them into the other guys. That said, the only chance this game had would have been to wow me with some great atmosphere and immersiveness. If you can't even spell 'Chesapeake' right, I'm not immersed.  Anyway..2/10  PS: I want to again stress that I am not a Total War fan. You may or may not be. If you've never played a Total War before, I suggest downloading the demo first.
477	0	a	Not the worst total war game, not the best. I would definetly call it forgetable, you want a total war game? Go buy shogun 2, Rome 1, medieval 2...
478	0	a	Nothing says fun like having your soldiers line up, or not controlling the recruitment of your agents.  The games released before and after (Medieval 2, and Shogun 2) were way better
479	0	a	The game is okay but units acted stupid and other countries lets just say shoot first and care later. But there are other games what are going to be better than this.
480	0	a	Just get fall of the samurai 
4155	1	a	))
523	0	a	Running an empire is too time consuming.
524	0	a	If you have Windows ten dont bother it doesnt work, it crashes at the loading screen 
525	0	a	The game refuses to play on my Mac. Click 'Play' button on the startup screen and CRASH!
526	0	a	I like how this game portrays the Native American Indians as dangerous bad guys, and the white colonialists as the good guys ...  As someone who has played all the Total War games, it really is disgusting all the racial stereotypes and biased representation of history.  Not to mention the gameplay where all non western factions are usually nerfed, and come in cheap, weak blob/zerg spam units.
527	0	a	i can run war thunder on hight this game i tried running it on low but nearly everytime it just glitches me out of a game for some reason it doesnt even crash i have good connection and it shows me the main menu without me wanting it to. Its a fun game but the pain i have to deal with its a 1v1 why does it get me back to starter menu and it was all fine too nothing was wrong it just got me out of the game same thing happens in 1v1 when i verse ai also there were a lot less troops on the map it was the end game
528	0	a	I don't understand why anyone would like this game, im just glad I bought it when it only costed 4.99. First of all, this game is incredibly buggy and slow paced. Second, the controls are downright aweful and very hard to get used to. Third of all, it has very little content and is incredibly boring.
529	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
530	0	a	Yankee doodle went to gamestop, riding in his hummer.  Picked this game up and said it was a Bummer.
531	0	a	What. The. $##%? Come on Total War. I am sick of this trash. Empire: Total War is a terrible ripoff of Sid Meier's Civilization franchise. They even cost the same amount (I think). Don't even think of getting this game just go get Sid Meier's Civ V. Please for the love of (no god because I am an athiest) don't get this game!! Final Verdict: 4/10 Below Average.    12/27/16 Update: The final verdict is finnaly decided a 1 OUT OF A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 100000. NO LIES THIS GAME IS AN INSULT TO ALL TOTAL WAR AND SRATEGY GAMES EVER. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT BECOMES FREE OR A REALLY GOOD DEAL. FOR YOUR SAKE DON'T BUY IT.    P.S To all commenters what i mean by Civ 5 is ANY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CIV GAME EVER you mentally challenged fools.

4157	1	a	A lot of people claim this game is buggy. It isn't. I have over 600 hours on my laptop and 300 hours on my desktop and I can assure you I have only encountered one bug. Cavalry sometimes gets its pathfinding confused and fails to take a direct route. The game world is huge. Combat stretches across continants and oceans and the unit diversity is massive. The game is further enhanced by mods which add countless hours of replayability. Enjoy!
4159	1	a	great game
4161	1	a	Excellent game. If you enjoy strategy that is all encompassing, this is the game for you. Very subtle nuances of the game continue to emerge, even after playing this game religiously since its inception. No finer product on the market.
4163	1	a	It really awesome and cool
4165	1	a	Empire:  +Massive, 3 Theater World (Although crippled by small # of provinces) +Many different nations to choose from (Sharing the same bland, cookie cutter format albeit) +Fire by Rank +Open Ended Campaign  -AI (Campaign and Battle) -Bugs (Half finished on release and I'm being kind) -Same units for each army mostly -Same ships for each navy -Doesn't feel polished (Wonder why)  Napoleon:  +Better AI +More army differentiation +Attrition and Supply System +More, smaller regions +Better art design (completely subjective, but the 'portraits' in ETW were horrible) +Physically larger campaign map +Enhanced GFX engine  -Smaller scope -Cost high for what is essentially a glorified expansion -little, if any integration or enhancement with/for its parent game, ETW -Only 4 nations to choose from in GC -was developed and released during a time when CA should have been focusing all its energy on repairing and upgrading Empire
4167	1	a	Best Total War period so far, Best Grand Stragegy maps, but worst A.I. 8.7/10 Hope CA making this great period on Empire : Total War 2 next time.
4169	1	a	Complete AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!
4171	1	a	One of the best in the series, really took Total War to a new level.
4173	1	a	First Total War game I ever played and the best in my opinion.
4175	1	a	One of the best strategy games I have ever played. The world map is just incredible. Definitely recommend for history buffs and strategy gamers.
4177	1	a	IF YOU TAKE IT AS A TOTALLY NEW FRANCHISE AND GAME: A pretty nice game.I think it's better than the 'Making History' series.It has the campaing map that allows you to do strategy as an armchair general and a feature that I really like, the battles.You get to command all the units you have previously trained and the fact that an individual unit is not rock solid (I mean the soldiers move separately,some remain behind some try to get in front ) is really interesting.The graphics are nice,even for a game released in 2010.I like it ,but it gets a litle boring after a bit , so mods are really welcome. IF YOU TAKE IT AS A TOTAL WAR GAME: It's not the greatest.Rome,Napoleon are better.I've heard alot of people complaining about performance issues, but I don't have any.(Is it my computer?)Quite enjoyable , but more unit variety would be nice. OVERALL: It's worth buying.
535	0	a	Empire Total War made some positive changes to the Total War formula (Naval Battles, Map Size) but ultimately missed the mark. The Campaign AI is worse than it ever has been and the political intrigue of the era is totally lost to a brain-dead diplomacy system.
4179	1	a	Good game, very different from the other total war games in that the frequent and neccesary use of firearms changes tactics dramatically
536	0	a	Doesn't work.. Everytime when I try to upload a battle.. It crashes... WTH?! The DEMO is the only thing that works
4181	1	a	It's fricken long.
4183	1	a	The best Total War game, to me. Rome: Total War in it's original was on the same level when it was newly released. Fewer bugs on Empire: Total War. Do not buy this if you are into multiplay. Look for mods on the net as well, will give more playtime for you.
4185	1	a	YES YES YES.  This game is why Creative Assembly is going to be the father of my children. Such a peice of art work, with more positive sides then blind blonde twins. I used to have dreams about this game in my sleep, and I wont deny I woke up with my hands down my pants more than once. I love you SEGA for publishing it, and I will remember this game forever.  Yummmey
4187	1	a	Its so much fun
4189	1	a	A good mixed. If you like Turn-Based or RTS, you'll be satisfied with this game. Extreme amount of depth and great variety between the factions as well as the different terrain elements depending on the region of the world you are fighting. Strongly recommend for the strategy fan.
4191	1	a	This games so great i spent much of my life on this game i wish diplomacy was like dimocracey 3 more diplomatic options is my complaint for this game
4193	1	a	I love this game so much i has put hundreds of hour into this game on anouther acount it is my second favrit total war game out of the lot and i would deffinitly recomend this.
4195	1	a	If they didn't half ♥♥♥ this game it would be the greatest total war. Darthmod makes it great but still with its issues. Size and scope of the game does not compare to the other Total Wars. Empire should've had most of the mechanics from shogun 2 fall of the samurai.
4197	1	a	This game is ultimate to the MAX!!!! it includes real battles that actualy happend!!! lots of stratagy and can play co-op battles with friends, this game isnt a waste of money and should be played!!!!
4199	1	a	Totally recommended this game people who like strategy games.One minus is multiplayer he is not so good how he should be.   9/10
4201	1	a	If you're an AP Euro alumnus like myself, you'll be astonished by how this game resembles the McKay, Hill, Buckler textbook 'A History of Western Society (Volume 9)'. You'll be met by visuals only surpassed by the Exploring Art sections of the McKay, Hill, Buckler textbook 'A History of Western Society (Volume 9)' and you will be surprised to find extraordinary Far Eastern and Far Western realms to explore and conquer. I could say much more about this magnificent game but I must return to my studies and work on obtaining my artium doctor (Doctor of the Arts) at NWTC.
4203	1	a	Brilliant game, best campaign map of all the total war games spanning across 3 continents, and most varied troop types between nations I have ever seen! Best TW game by far and totally doesn't deserve its reputation as an unreliable game! :)
4205	1	a	one of the best games ever made.
4207	1	a	this game is awesome
4209	1	a	first total war game i played and second favorite (shogun two is my favorite), i played as russia and i completely wrecked the whole ottoman empire in around 2 hours. it is very easy just to pick up and play without a tutorial. things i like - routing system - being able to switch to melee - taxing system - techonlogy tree - ai declares war on people that they did in real life (russia-ottoman empire, austria- poland...) i would recomend this to my friends  10/10
4211	1	a	One of the best, most in-depth strategy games ever.
4213	1	a	One of the finest strategy games out there. I love the combat, I love the world map (except the political instability mechanic, which isn't fleshed out enough and seems to exist only to be exploited).  I just wish the game was less buggy and didn't crash every time I tried to play it.
4215	1	a	Great game as always from tw but the battles can get old quickly as the diversity of troops is no longer there. cannon are extremly inaccurate and caverly and melee troops get crushed by line infantry. Most factions only have 3 or 4 types of line infantry. AI is also prone to suicide as they will attack a full stack with 6 units in an open field leaving their town ungaurded. Diplomacy is ridicoulous regardless of what your trying to accomplish.
4217	1	a	Alot of fun but a tad easy. I wish there was more in depth economic settings. soldiers respond a little slow to orders so make plans ahead of time
4219	1	a	You can command thousands of troops on the field to defend the country or dominate the world; the Americas, Europe, and India. Buy it then get out and fight!  Look at my total hours. Many people don't know how fun total war is...  Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 9/10 Controls 8/10 Storyline 9/10 Bug-Free 7/10 Replayability 10/10 Level of Challenge 10/10
4221	1	a	I got my full monies worth out of this game. For an old game at this time, it has aged well. Look for it on sale if your new to the Total War series and pick it up. The naval combat was satisfying, and the improved trading system just made more sense in this game.  Final result: Buy it
4223	1	a	i recomend you get it it is worth it trust me 
4225	1	a	these game is alsome the guns and the thinking but i finded nepolen eleter better and i dont like the grafix that much there faces scarses me but I LOVE TOTAL WAR!!!!!!
4227	1	a	If you like the Total War series, the romaticism of 18th century warfare, or history in general, it's really very simple: you must own this game.
4229	1	a	This is simply one of the best strategy games i've played ever. You'll eventually get tired of it, but the gameplay hours it will provide you are almost endless, mine are 300 hours of quality gaming in an inmersive atmosphere with an awesome background music. It's a 9.5/10.
540	0	a	The AI in this game is so subpar its a joke. CA never bothered to really fix this game, just released it and moved on to the next game. A game that fixed alot of these problems, and then never bothered to retro fix Empire. BOOOO
4231	1	a	byu far the best total war game there is i have played everyone of them and the story and play of this one takes the top spot. i love this game
4233	1	a	After years of being a console gamer, I'm just now starting to play PC games and so far the Total War series has me kicking myself for not starting sooner.   The gameplay gets you hooked and the tactical battles have me spending hours at a time formulating winning strategies.  Definietly reccomend this and other games in the series
4235	1	a	The game is fun, however, there are many bugs in this game and in other total war games. This is absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional to continue producing games that have the same issues. It shows a lack of integrity as a business and as a leading game producer. You probably justify it by saying that you're company is economically driven, you produce games knowing that they have serious issues but are still 'playable' because you can.... Seriously... fix the games, more specifically the choppiness.
4237	1	a	Best turn based strategy game on the market. It is very tactical and really makes you think. 9/10
4239	1	a	As a fan of the Total War franchise, I find Empire: Total War my personal favourite. The naval battles really set it apart from the earlier titles. And the tech tree is massive! It requires you to either really focus on certain aspects or have multiple colleges for research. The three theatres of operation (Europe, America, and India) and multiple trade zones add to the challenge of maintaining your empire. You have many fronts to defend but so do your adversaries. Overall it's a very solid game.  Highlights of latest campaign playing as the Netherlands:  -Crushed the French by taking Paris by turn 20. Their overseas colonies all go rebel except one; welcome to the world stage the nation of Quebec.  -Conquered Madrid. Gave it to one of my new best friends: Portugal. Spain only exists on Sardinia now.  -Conquered all of Scandinavia. Gave it all to my other best friend: Hannover. They are a true world power now and have been taking it to Russia ever since giving them Finland.  -After stabbing former ally England in the back found that the Irish and Scottish were happy to have my rule but England itself rebelled four times before they consented to the yoke. They now love the Republic too.  -As a result of the conquest of England the United States rose in America. Started a war with me over the Carolinas. I captured the USS Consitution and it's now the flagship of my frigate fleet. Thanks for the unique unit, America! And the war doesn't go so good for them...  -The Maratha Confederacy foolishly declared war on me. Used a V.O.C. army to conquer all of their holdings in India. Kept a couple territories, gave the rest to the very friendly Mughal Empire. Hinduism is almost non-existent as a religion, replaced by Protestantism and Islam.
4241	1	a	My favorite Total War of all time. They need to make an Empire 2!!
4243	1	a	great game but the graphics are crappy and the soldiers take forever to reload. but great game overall and has great siege battles 
4245	1	a	Well I have to say, FREAKING SPECTACULAR. But I cant seem to get past one of the missions due to some of the enemy players being glitched outside the map and also some others being glitched so they are invisible to me but on the minimap they are visible. But other than that. For all you well know and underknowleged strategy gamers I recommend this game. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10/10 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And a word for the devs, C.P.D has your back XD
4247	1	a	Awesome game sega. Makes you go back to the 18 century and command armys of the old days.
4249	1	a	A good game for simple desires, I myself wanted a large realistic battle game, but it seems like just a taste of of it, if the graphics are too good, then its laggy, if they are low, then it's not as fun because it doesn't feel real. There is no medium. Also you can only play as a smal handful of the Nations.
4251	1	a	Love this game if you like the cross between turn based stratagy maps and real time combat and tactics this is a must to own!
4253	1	a	Fought pirates in a thunderstorm.
4255	1	a	Very enjoyable game thousands of hours of game play mulitiplayer is good and you can play as you own nation and travel the world
4257	1	a	This game is my all time favorite, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves history or strategy games, such as myself.
4259	1	a	I really enjoyed it! It's a new engine compared to previous total War games, however I believe it works good but just short of great. I have spent many nights comquering Europe, and I and truly enjoyed kicking@ss throughout the continent! &gt;:)  If you're into strategy, seeing huge battles, and managing an empire, then this is your game. As of it's $10 price right now, it's a must have.   Enjoy the power!
4261	1	a	Excellent, very glad Total War was able to step up and keep the series improving with each iteration. Perfect for anyone who has an interest in warfare of the musket-era.
4263	1	a	Get it. Install DarthMod. Explode.
542	0	a	Crashes every 10 minutes, unplayable...
4265	1	a	Native Americans conquered Canada.  8/10
4267	1	a	I suggest you buy Napoleon total war instead of this one, the graphics are not that good the user interface is terrible and ugly, but other than that I love this game. Unless you want a bigger map don't buy this game buy Napoleon. 8/10
4269	1	a	Quite simply, probably the best total war game to date in terms of replayability.
4271	1	a	yes, yes and yes a mustard try for any strategy gamer.
4273	1	a	Started a empire as Britain. A native american tribe attacked some of my trading posts in America. I decided to take over and destroy every village belonging to that tribe, Then had every native american tribe in america attack my capital city    11/10 would never ♥♥♥♥ with native americans again
543	0	a	why in the helll this game is not working on windows 7 ......what i must do to resolve the issue...pls
4275	1	a	Great real time strategy game, although it lacks replay value as the combat can get stale.
4277	1	a	The last great Total War game. Too much was made of its teething problems; long ago resolved, this nails why it was fun being a European coloniser, and much less fun to be colonised.
4279	1	a	I first played this with a fairly average gaming set up. My PC wasn't up to scratch and it was pretty slow.  Fast-forward to three years later (2014). This is a pretty different TW experience altogether. I'm so used to the close-quarters combat you see in other TW titles, this one took me by surprise, with the game featuring units with more slower paced, long range weaponry.  I always wanted to experience the 1700s American Revolutionary wars, and now I can. The campaign takes a lot of getting used to. I'm still learning as I write this review. It is a lot slower than previous entries, but don't let it take you away from the game.  There are A LOT of factions in this installment - and I do mean a lot! Early adopters of this game found themselves looking at the end-turn screen more often than using the campaign map itself. This has since been patched and the turns are a little quicker than before. Other titles in the franchise still lead in that department, however.  I'm getting too technical with this, so I'll make it brief.  Empire Total War is a great, and different kind of game in the Total War franchise. If you're looking for gunpowder, this is your game. If you're still too much into the clashing of swords and spears and cavalry, you will find it here, just not as much as you would in other TW games. This is the most modern iteration of the series and it is fantastic once you get the hang of it.  Gameplay: 8/10 - Playing the battles themselves is fantastic. I have to drop points for the campaign map, though, as it is a little bit crowded, but not enough to dull your experience - just a little patience is all that's needed.  Sound: 10/10 - I love hearing the noise of those muskets being reloaded and fired. It sounds terrific. If there's one thing Total War games do well, its capturing the most realistic war audio ever assembled in a video game.  Visuals: 10/10 - If you have a decent rig, you will see exactly why I gave it a 10. But even on a lower Shader Model, the game looks tremendous.  Overall: 9/10 - As I said, it's one of the more slower paced Total War games, in my books. Once you get passed the learning aspect, you will really enjoy this game.  And I highly recommend it
4281	1	a	This is the best total war game ive ever played
4283	1	a	What can I say, I love the Total War series. Its accurate, fun, sucks you in, and allows you to pause the game and pick up at a later time so that you can better organize your forces. Amazing franchise, amazing game. 10/10
544	0	a	Don't bother, buy shogun and its expansion. This game is 'fine' but just that, fine. Nothing more.  -Ai issues, balance issues, battle issues, difficulty issues.... all because the Air it's dumb to say the least.... so, please buy shogun  postscript: Napoleon it's slightly better, but still have issues.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naQaRIaXyAU 
4285	1	a	This game is my god mode.
4287	1	a	Nice game, with long term strategy. I bought it with an almost 90% discount. It does not worth a lot of money (in my opinion). If you like military strategy, battleships fights and more, stop thinking and buy it!  For me: 7/10
4289	1	a	i Like the game but i hate the game dont have a Workshop it could be awesome if i could download some Nations.
4291	1	a	With the DarthMod this game is magnificent.
4293	1	a	i like all total wars games but i yet to see a World war 1 or world war 2 total war now this is mods but the people that made the game should make a new game base off the world war
4295	1	a	There is allot to get use to but it is a good game.
4297	1	a	Best Total War to date. Love it.
4299	1	a	Be prepared to lead armies amouting up to about 16,000 men across three different theatres. Also take to diplomacy and establish trade routes and alliances. All in all; a very fun game for any strategy fan.
4301	1	a	This game is kinda meh... if you like commanding armies it's okay. Id rather spend money on Earth Empire or something along those lines... but if you like the EMPIRE series and 1600's then this is your game. Multiplayer lacks greatly imo...
4303	1	a	it can be a little slow but wth the ability to conquer America Europe and India this is one of the biggist total war games i have played.
4305	1	a	Full of rank'n'file goodness 
4307	1	a	Awesome game, can be annoying sometimes due to bugs and awkward behaviour of units, but at the end of the day it's tremendously fun.
547	0	a	Great game!
548	0	a	Several game ending bugs and errors still plaque this otherwise intriquing title. End game crashes, and memory leaks leave you wishing that more testing by the devs was goal shared by all. All little extra effort and this could have been game of the decade... instead, so much wasted potential.
4309	1	a	I can't say i've played this game for very long. ;P But all jokes aside i've been in love with all the total wars games since there start. This is a great game and will get you lost in a new world. Good luck taking over the world! :)
4311	1	a	greatest total war game even the newer ones dont come close
4313	1	a	maybe not as good as MTW2 but it has everything if you like the thin red line
4315	1	a	Probly thee best total war game I have ever played in my life hours of fun trust me !!!
4317	1	a	Aaaaaaaamazing. Just wanted to put another thumbs up out there for this game. Best of the Total War Series.
4319	1	a	How do you play the expantion packs?....Need help please
4321	1	a	Total War is one of my favourite game series. This game, with it's beautiful looks, was the icing on the cake.
4323	1	a	A very addictive turn based strategy game that encompasses war, politics and economics on a global scale.
4325	1	a	Excellent game, I still play it and that with 300 hours on record!, relitively historicly accurate ( no not exactly haters, mostly I said ).   My personal suggestion ? , get this game play through vanila , then get ' darth mod ' and install this and run, its a little buggie but it allows 40 divisions on map! , this leads to some epic fights that can take a while to win yes, but it ' feels ' more like the battles should.   Navel combat = Excellent, having the HMS Victory put a broadside into a spanish war gallon and watching its powder keg ignite is impressive.   Buy , play and enjoy just make sure your computer is closer to the ' recommended ' then the ' minimum ' specifications.
4327	1	a	Amazing game. Perfect for lover of the total war series that want to immerse themselves in the patriotism of the birth of America but also as the first in the series to display guns as the common weaponry which involves totally new conflict and stratgies within the game. This proves a challange from the usual bull rushes of the prior games with iron clad warriors. The series of total war is amazing and this game easily stands out.
4329	1	a	Suprising that this game is a little similiar to Napoleon Total War but this game is so much better and more fun. I was looking for this type of total war for awhile and I love this game so much. Better than Napoleon in many ways
4331	1	a	&gt;Beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of Sweden &gt;Sweden surrenders &gt;France starts war with everyone &gt;Move my troops into Netherlands to recapture the land &gt;Paris is right infront of me WW1 all over again 10/10 Prussia&gt;All
4333	1	a	An army of the chervokees beat the british  10/10
4335	1	a	Well 360hrs + and still going nothing else to say really//
4337	1	a	i really like this game but it crashes my cp after a few minutes of play.
4339	1	a	Other than no multiplayer campaign its a pretty good game.  Indians declared war on Britain, and won. 10/10
4341	1	a	Awesome game, it's totaly worth the money.
4343	1	a	Amazing, have been playing it for years and still not bored of the action. This game is absolutely revelutionary. The addition of naval battles to the Total War series has made an incredible contribution to the gameplay, making Empire Total War my absolute favorite all the series.
4345	1	a	Amazing game-I'd give it 5 stars. Tons of choices, Naval, Land, realistic Scenarios, and a sweet Campaign. Awesome graphics, nice attention to detail, from the wood on the fences, the muskets, the soldiers' uniforms, the grass, truly epic. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes strategy and historic events/military. Best game on the market for military and strategy nerds, i would say.
4347	1	a	Amazing! Like playing a Complex version of Risk
4349	1	a	Good title of sega, there are a lots of units and naval battles. I think that Empire Total War is the best Total war game.
4351	1	a	addictive game!
4353	1	a	I really like this game. It's fun, smart and civilized. Beautiful music plays while you plan to take over the world; what could be more relaxing? The naval battles are the best part; they alone justify whatever you pay. And you might learn a few things about history, and blowing stuff up.
4355	1	a	It's great if you like history and strategy!
4357	1	a	Austria colonizing india, Ottomans Colonizing America, Indian tribes defeating my 2000 british army, 3rd turn USA formed, Polans annexes Russia, France conquering London. 10/10 would replay again.
4359	1	a	This Game is better than all of the total war games. They need to make more games like this!
4361	1	a	Major Defeat 111/10
4363	1	a	A good alternative to newer titles if you don't want to spend 60 $. Installing darthmod makes the game far better than napoleon and gives plenty new playing oportunities.  Recomended.  7/10 no darthmod.  9/10 with darthmod.
4365	1	a	'Welcome to the Salty Splitoon How tough are yeh?'  'How tough am I I invaded all of america'  'So?'  'With only 1 Regiment'  'Right this way sir'
4367	1	a	great game
4369	1	a	this game is very good it represents the era of this time.
4371	1	a	I purchased this game before being deployed to Iraq in 2010 and quickly became addicted. Out of all of the Total War games this one is by far my favorite. This is somewhat obvious from over 430 hours logged. I have followed the Total War franchise since its beginning by playing the original Shogun and I have played at least partially through most of the games.  In order to outline why this is my favorite here is a brief list.  1. The variety of countries to play 2. The feel of the battles (cannon fire is very satisfying) 3. The balance between managing resources and armies in the campaigns  The only downside for me that exists with the game is its tendency to crash. While it wasn't as bad for me as for other people it did happen once or so per 10 game startups and in the middle of a battle every once in a while. Other than that, it is a very satisfying and fun game that I still play occasionally.
4373	1	a	I so wish they make a sequel to this game....I love taking over the world as Prussia!!
4375	1	a	It's the best! I love it and I think that the creators should make a total war game about WW2. A problem I have is that the game slows down after the year 1800 and 1840. The game slows during the other player's turn while I waited. My advice is that you should play the game to where the extent is; on the panel where it says Prestige victory, short victory, long victory
4377	1	a	This game is not like most TW games. It's slightly glitchy and unfinished. The singleplayer world map has abit too much going on. But combat is fun with a friend.
4379	1	a	very nice game! once played it's hard to stop
4381	1	a	Best Total War game ever!!
4383	1	a	While I do recommend this this game, I do so hesitantly.  Despite enjoying hours and hours of game time across a few years, I find that while I do enjoy the game itself it has a tendency to become somewhat repedetive and less interesting after you reach a certain point in the campaign. The battles are perhaps where the game falls the shortest; the urge to use basic units because of their effectiveness is high and the generals (which are essentially recruitable wherever you have an army) are bland and I find I am unable to invest any interest in them whatsoever.  The naval battles, however, are a nice addition from previous Total War games and despite having to get used to them (which may take a litttle time) they are one of the game's freshest facets.   Despite the recommendation for this game, I would suggest instead of aquiring Empire: Total War, one should rather invest in a different title under the Total War franchise, such as Medieval II or Shogun II - both of which are more versatile and fresh than Empire: Total War. However, if you are looking for an incredibly vast playing map in the years dominated by political and militaristic imperialism, Empire: Total War may be what you are searching for, especially with the revolutionary options available at any times within the Campaign.
4385	1	a	I am so bad at this game 10/10
4387	1	a	This game is amazing!!!
4389	1	a	Let me start off by saying that I am a huge total war fan, ever since medieval: total war I was hooked. At first, I was afraid if I would get the game back in 2009 because it was the first total war game to be put on steam. I had read all the reviews about the game(mostly bad) and steered away from it, I'm sorry I did. I finally picked up the game a year later and was blown away by it. First, the graphics were a huge step up from the previous total war(medieval 2), just see for yourself and judge. Second, the era of the game(ever watch the movie Patriot and wish you could do that kind of battle, well you can). And third, the actual combat that goes on in battle. If the campaign map is the bread, then the battles are the stuff in between that holds it together. You have to fight from a tactical perspective(like other total wars) worrying if your flanks are exposed to calvary, if your lines will hold against enemy fire, and hoping that your general doesn't get killed by a stray shot. These are just a few examples that help make my point. The amount of things that you can research is so helpful with making your troops better in battle such as fire by rank, quarter master, standard issue weapons, etc.... I could go on about it. Now for the bad stuff, luckily I am able to fit all of my issues onto one short piece of paper(unlike other reviewers, cough cough). First, the campaign map. I don't know what the developers were thinking when they were designing territories, but it just ended up falling short. Well how do I put it, you have alot of 'towns' to protect besides your own regional capital, forcing you the player to have to do more than bolster up defenses at your main city and watch the other resource producing towns around you. Now this would seem like a good idea on paper, but doesn't get executed very well. If your trying to stop an enemy army from constantly burning down every single factory or school in your territory, you have to split up your army into tiny little fragments in order to hunt down every last one of them. This may seem fine, but in reality this goes sideways when you do it in a recently taken over territory. I mean, whatever happened to just taking a city and razing it and making the people happy to just be alive, no instead there is a massive rebellion in the territory no matter how many troops your put in the garrrison, armed to the teeth with musketeers, cannons, cavalry, I mean were did the rebels get such stuff. I got off track, oh well, that's my only major complaint about the game, the difficulty of taking territories. Besides that, It's a pretty awesome game. It seems like I put more words in for negative than good, oh well I'm too lazy anyway and no one will probably read this review. If however you do find this review, congratulations you found a needle in a haystack of reviews=)
4391	1	a	Doesn't take long to immerse yourself in this gem and still looks great for it's age. Marching your armies across Europe, the Americas and the Sub-Continent to further your Colonial power. I played as Great Britain to start with and had jolly good fun wiping out the peace loving native tribes in the new world. Burning down their villages and installing my own Governor’s to out their old beliefs.  The good 'old Christian way!!!
4393	1	a	Now, the Total War series has to be one of my absolute favorites. Empire: Total War continues that awesomeness. One of my favorite features of these games, especially this one, is the way you can drastically change history. As Prussia, I have claimed Austria and Bavaria, kicked the Italians out of Venice, Italy, and turned the entire European world against Sweden. Now, these are the things I have done. What I do then effects what other nations do as well. Spain destroyed Portugal, Great Britain is now killing off the Indians before the colonists have even gotten the chance to have a revolution. The French and Indian war? That has come 40 years ahead of its time as trade with my spectacular Prussia has boosted the British economy to crush the French. This isn't just some turn-based game either, it CAN be just that if you'd prefer, but if you want more from your ordinary turn-based game, Empire: Total War sends you into the musket fire. Let me be honest when I say the only dissapointing feature of this game are the sieges. They show the buildings the enemy or as well as yourself have built, a barracks, or the government buildings, but thats pretty much it. Maybe 1-5 buildings inside fortified walls. The older Rome Total War's would give you many houses and organized streets unlike the newer Empire: Total War. Don't get me wrong though, it is still very fun to charge your infantry into the broken walls of an enemy fortress. If you want to succeed at this game, whether its simply to control 20 other regions or to dominate the world, just learn from past mistakes in history. Bring your small nation to become a world power capable of pulverizing Spain, Great Britain, and France. Good luck with your world domination!
4395	1	a	this game is awsome the dlc is realy helpful i recommend this game to the players who want to buy this game 
4397	1	a	Empire: Total War, I loved when they released this I love the entire era of the British-American colonies, so maybe I am a bit biased. They made this game to be as realistic as they could (while still making it a fun game) there are line infantry that will only fire from the first line but in that time that was normal there are, however, units that can fire all at the same time you just need to find them. The sea battles was a wonderful edition to the game and I absolutely love it I enjoy taking a single fifth rate into a battle and heading upwind and killing several 4th rates. One unfortunate thing is Friendly Fire because, well actually thats self explanatory, if you have a single group of infantry units they will not be able to FF however if you have two groups and one is behind they other expect heavy casualties on the forward one, also careful on the sea keep your ships together so they don't FF each other that can cost you a battle as well.    Overall this is my second favorite game, behind Mass Effect.
4399	1	a	Great game, countless hours of fun after all the patches ( was extremely buggy when released) I'd buy this one over again over all the others (except mabe Medieval II: Total War)
4401	1	a	one of them games that you can't play for just a few mins as it turns into hours
4403	1	a	Love this game theres still a few bugs but better than what ive heard about rome 2
4405	1	a	Sprites ugly
4407	1	a	I would give this game an 8.2/10 Like the global domination and powerful armies  I disliked the Naval battles, could use some tinkering in the land combat aswell. I also found getting negative opinions for territorial expansion was too high for every time you capture a region, or not needed for many regions depending on the country you chose.
4409	1	a	I highly recommend this game for exciting map and battle modes.
4411	1	a	It's a excelent strategy game, you'll have three huge maps to explorer. An extense campaign and content into the game. Worth check it.
4413	1	a	IMHO, the best part of the Total War Series. No Warcraft-like Commander superpowers like in the prequels, and a nice economic system that hits the right point between simplicity and complexity. Highly addictive.
553	0	a	It's been almost 5 ♥♥♥♥ing years and the campaign map still ♥♥♥♥ing stutters! DO NOT BUY.
4415	1	a	Quite possibly the best in the Total War series! Love this game, the increased map size, massive campaign for world domination, fantastic battles and introduction of sea battles although these are rather difficult to get the hang of!  The AI has seen a marked improvement even if it still has moments of bizarre behaviour. The sheer size and scale of this game make it a must buy. On the more difficult settings it proves itself as one of the best strategy games ever made.  The only problem with this game is that it will consume countless hours of your life!
4417	1	a	Fire and Charge....... YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!
4419	1	a	I Think i have played this game too much , keep coming back to it time after time , if you like to colonize and have large empires then this game is for you even if you like to keep it small this game has it 10/10 from me
4421	1	a	An excellent game that is, in my opinion, the best Total Wat game so far. The game handled the transition from the Medieval period well, incorporating the shift towards democracy, parliaments, better technology, gunpowder weapons and the New World very well.
4423	1	a	I love this era and love it even more in gaming. It is hard to find strategy games first during this time in history and secondly with this much content. I really with that would have made more countries playable and/or expanded the map. But I would still give this game a 9 out of 10 and would recommend this to anyone to atleast give it a try.
4425	1	a	When I first bought this I was unsure as it was reviewed as a buggy mess. However, after patching this has become one of my favourites from the series.
4427	1	a	Awesome historical Game where you play as a Nation, Britian, France, Prussia, Austria, Martha Confederacy and the Ottomans to name a few, and attempt to conquer the world. Loads of fun with turn based decisions on the world map and real time army and naval battles.
4429	1	a	Best in the Series
4431	1	a	If you want to rule the world then this is the game for you, when it released there was so much wrong with it however patches were released and as of now I still think Empire is the best Total War game to date !!
4433	1	a	
4435	1	a	controlling an empire for world domination, what more could you want for a lazy sunday arvo?!
4437	1	a	Probably my least favorite Total War game. The line infintry mechanic doesnt work that well but it still works. Hand to hand units are still much more satisfying and It takes a little bit of reconditioning to use the gun units effectively if you are use to any of the other Total War games. I would definitely recommend this game for any Total War fans, it won't be your favorite but it'll be different enough that it is challenging but fun. If you have never played a Total War game, do not start here, any of the other games in the series would be a better introduction. (Don't start with Napolean: Total War either)
4439	1	a	this game.....IS WARFARE FOR GODS!!!!!!!!
4441	1	a	One of the best in the series, at least of all the modern Total Wars. Check out mods for this one  (www.twcenter.net) 
4443	1	a	It is a true Total War experience. I was quite afraid of bringing Total War series into 18th century, but Creative Assembly managed to rise to the challenge.   Do not look at my playtime/achivements, I used to play in 'Steam offline' mode. In fact, I consider it as a minor disadvantage, that E:TW requires Steam installed (even when bought from retail)
4445	1	a	This game is fun and brilliantly made! When you think only minutes passed it has been really a couple hours! Those types of games is what makes gaming actually nice and exciting.
4447	1	a	lots of people say this is the weakest game in the total war collection, and they are wrong i for one loved it. :)
4449	1	a	Pretty good game, my only problem is some units not doing what they are supposed to and not following in setup formations.
555	0	a	The game has incredibly blurry, almost unreadable text for certain monitors and resolution settings (mainly widescreens). This issue is apparently very common based on my hours of research, and was caused by a bad patch, but the developer simply moved on and left those of us affected with a borderline-unplayable game.  I have messed with all possible settings configurations nd cannot find an actual solution that allows me to play the game for more than 10 minutes without a headache.  This issue is especially odd considering I can play Medieval 2 (an older title in the series) with no problems.  Do not buy this game unless you are willing to accept this risk.
4451	1	a	I never understood what all the hate was about. This is a great game, both the strategy and the battlefield aspects. Of course, I am a European history and culture buff, so it's a joy for me to see all my old friends live again.
4453	1	a	Change history in a game of Empire: Total Embargo.
4455	1	a	One of the best strategic games ever made.
4457	1	a	One of the best of this series. It encompasses most of the world and does a great job of recreating the power of trade and naval power. Where Napolean tends to focus on Europe. If you want a open sand box, get this over Napolean.
4459	1	a	It's just the most impressive game about the 18th century
4461	1	a	Are you going to ever make a civil war north and south total war pc game for us to play and enjoy?? Anyway this total war Empire ROCKS MY WORLD !!!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to make this pc game... Are you also going to make a total war WW 1 AND WW 2 pc game for us to play and enjoy???
4463	1	a	:)
4465	1	a	The gold standard for European theatre strategy games. A must for all fans of Sharpe.
4467	1	a	This game here is a masterpeice. 10/10 for gameplay and strategy and........................tea.
4469	1	a	really good game :)
4471	1	a	Great historical Game!
4473	1	a	It's real time and turn based strategy at it's finest. You can fight the Russians in Europe, the Mughal Emire in Indian, and the Native Americans in...I can't right remember. A great buy for history buffs or Total War fans. But the best part is Road to Independence which shows the rise of........'merica!!!
4475	1	a	Ever see tin soldiers? Play with this instead.
4477	1	a	The only Total War game in which to really conquer the world!
4479	1	a	I'M ADDICTED!!!!!!!!
4481	1	a	amazing my favourite of the total war series
4483	1	a	Great game , If you like strategy game , that is it.  Buy it on Steam , you wont regret it .   Stef Chief Warren Officer  Crash Rescue Fire Fighter Dept.
4485	1	a	yes completely the best total war 
4487	1	a	Excellent and challenging, With a reasonably steep learning curve. Mods out there improve the little areas that you might find lacking, but if you like large scale Turn based strategy games, you'll like this. The Battles also have a real time option, which can be both fun and infuriating, but rarely boring.
4489	1	a	Still the best Total War to date 2014
4491	1	a	I bought it for £15. Worth it.  Shame it went on sale a few hours later for £3.74. Oh well. *LUCK*
4493	1	a	Best Game out of the Total War Series because of the Fact Theres alot more nations to play as and fighy #ETW
4495	1	a	#1 lining up dudes and making them shoot at eachother simulator
4497	1	a	Definitely the best TW game out there with the greatest scope (North/Central America, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and India, plus trading posts around the rest of the world for naval battles), nicely varied armies (can be broadly categorized into Native American, European, Muslim, and Indian unit types, but with regional variations), decent naval combat, and competent ranged units that totally change the dynamic of the game's battles. Beware of stability issues, though, and I also miss all of the pre-made historical battles from RTW.
559	0	a	A decent Total War game. I actually really like the battles. Most of the units are ranged which is an interesting change from some of the other games. However, I feel that the management aspects don't make it very enjoyable.
4499	1	a	'Total War' - It's another one, therefore amazing!
4501	1	a	A wonderful game!
4503	1	a	Kind of like civilisations, but when two armies meet you have the option of personally fighting the battle in a top down 'Age of Empires' manner. Long games on each map, but very tactical.
4505	1	a	The last hope of Westphalia were waiting inside their fortress - two regiments of line infantry and a mess of flintlock armed citizenry. I battered the face of the fortress with my cannon while 2 regiments of line infantry marched to the west and 2 regiments marched to the East of the fortress. I made two holes in their defenses (a regiment of citizens didn't get off the wall fast enough and they fell with the rubble and died). I waited two more minutes for my units to get in place, then sent my cavalry through the right breach. Though outnumbered, the cavalry were able to distract the defenders long enough that my Forces from the East and West were able to scale and take the walls without difficulty. The rest of my infantry rushed through the left breach and occupied the rest of the fort.  I had the option to end it there, but I declined. The Westphalians had taken one of my towns a few turns back, and I was still sore about it. My line infantry took care of the citizens, but the remains of one of the Westphalian infantry regiments was able to sneak out the left breach and was routing at a full run to the edge of the battlefield. I had a reserve cavalry division left outside the fortress who gave chase.   The neat thing about this game is that you can zoom in so close you can see the buttons on your soldiers' jackets. I zoomed in on the five retreating Westphalians as they descended a hill, almost certain they were going to cross the red line and clear the field before I could get to them, but seconds later I saw my cavalry, swords drawn, thunder over the bluff and fall onto the last hope of Westphalia. Not one of them crossed that line.  Then I checked my email, washed some dishes and went to bed.  9/10
4507	1	a	i love this game with a burning pasion
4509	1	a	Sometimes, in a first person shooter, your bloodthirst isn't quite quenched. There are those frustrating days when you can't hit ♥♥♥♥. Those are the days when you need to play this game. After all, what better way to get revenge on that annoyingly accurate british guy on that game server than to lead 1,000 Native American warriors to chop 120 British scalps off? 11/10
4511	1	a	I like this game
4513	1	a	its an oldie but i got 707 hours locked in on it enough said
4515	1	a	great game but long installation time on steam
560	0	a	SEGA pushed CA to release it too soon. This is the result. Don't buy it. Don't even take it as a gift.
4517	1	a	fokin beast m8 
4519	1	a	An amazing game based on real historical events.
4521	1	a	Where can you play online campaign?
4523	1	a	This game has sweeping visuals, whether you are in a high stakes battle a sea or fighting across the hilly plains of europe, the game looks amazing. Engage in intense battles all across the world with the armies and navies of several european powers, Indian dynasties, and the peoples of North America. This game is really fun for people with deep tactical knowledge andthe smarts to defeat actuall people while playing online. 
4525	1	a	Very fun game to play. AI can be frustrating at times, but the positives certainly outweigh the negatives. If you're a fan of strategy games, or action games, I can tell you you'll enjoy this. Whether it's conquering Europe in Campaign, or just having an all out slaughter in quick battle, this game will help pass hours.
4527	1	a	Loved this game, especially the naval warfare. Steam says 169 hours but I am sure I had tons more offline and even more before I had linked it to steam. Though its unistalled now to make room for newer games it was worth every hour.
4529	1	a	One of the best empire buildin games there is. Check it out. Highly recommended.
4531	1	a	All Total War games are a must buy for strategy fans, or history fans. I read alot of military history in my spare time, and the Total War series have always been the most historically accurate and most realistic strategy games I've played. This is currently my favorite from the franchise. If you want a more realistic or challenging experience, look for mods on the internet.
4533	1	a	A bit buggy in animations at times, but I find it really strategic, and it gets me to actually think. Multiplayer is even more fun, but saddly this game is not very popular.
4535	1	a	My first game I ever had with steam. I have over 750 hours on this game. Hours upon hours of fun. Some may say Napoleon Total War is better, but the shear size and flexibility of Empire Total War makes it stand out from the rest. A completely classic game.
4537	1	a	very good game ya'll should play this game
4539	1	a	This is a good game, but after playing it extensivley, I observed some gaps that need to be filled in. I know the game was released in 2009, but there is no reason CA can't revisit this game and make some updates to the AI to improve the game overall. It shouldn't be too difficult, and will result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.  Some ideas to consider: Ditch the thirteen colonies, and make each colony a separate faction; Add attrition to naval units(i.e. a ship can't sit out in the ocean for years without starvation, mutiny, ship bottom falling out. etc); Enable characters to transition from gentlman to general to minister. Add more officer ranks so characters can rise from Leiutenant, captain, major, colonel, to general; Have a pool of characters to chose from different tiers of society(i.e. royalty, aristocracy, gentry, yeomanry, and so forth); Enable amphibious battles involving ships and land units; All characters of the aristocracy can duel; Add East India company as faction; Include buildings such as East India House, Bank of England(Throw Central Banks into the mix); Ships should be able to enter neutral and allied ports for repairs(at greater cost); When an army occupies a foreign town or port, you should be able to repair town and use its resources; You may not attack another monarchy's home capital unless one of your characters has a legitamate claim to that throne; If AI has character in another faction with claim to your throne, than it will spawn an army around that character to invade. You can chose to side with that army or fight it. If you take another Euro monarchy's home capital, you don't get that region, the character you used simply becomes the new king of that faction and you lose control of that character. The benefit is alliance and trade.  These are just a few ideas I'm throwing out there for CA or modders.
4541	1	a	Buggy, but still fun.
4543	1	a	Ever wanted to muck around with history? Well, now you can. As long as it pertains to the 18th century, that is. Empire: Total War is perfect if you want to wage war against the Ottoman Empire or conquer the Thirteen Colonies as Sweden. It also has references to many historical events such as the capturing and execution of Edward Kidd, so you can sort of use it as a learning tool. So gather up your men, cannons, and horses and go take that territory.
4545	1	a	I like this game becuase it gives you a challenge and also gives you an insight to what battles where like back in the oldern times. This game has good graphics, nice display, good combat mechanics, realistic plains. even if some of the battles seem to have a thousand soldiers per squad or platoon. I'd give this game an 8/10
4547	1	a	I love this game its realy addictive and i cant turn off my computer i am like 1 more turn and then i get atacked ok 1 more turn i get atacked ok 1 more turn and i am done then i realise that its night ok 1 more turn and i go to sleep after 120 turns i realyse thats its arleady morning most addictive game ever 10/10
4549	1	a	Shows how the great powers of Europe used imperialism to expand
4551	1	a	For a true connoisseur of strategy games and military history, definitely a game worth playing. Between the Road to Independence story, various Grand Campaigns to be done through Europe, India and the Americas with varying modes/difficulty, and the multiplayer experience, you easily have 700+ hours of gameplay.
4553	1	a	empire total war is set in the 18th centery and is also the first total war to have navel battles so for those who want to ern there sea legs this is your chanse i personally am not a skilled admeral but i play navel once in a while the land battles are differnt from previose total wars gun powder is widly used so if you have played othier total war games you may have to adapt your tactics the campagin is huge spanding the Americas, Europe, and India this gives you a lot more factions to interact with and more teritory to conquor this is in my opion a fine adition to the total war family
4555	1	a	Huge upgrade from the earlier titles. After playing through the previous Total War titles, this has to be my favourite among them.
4557	1	a	This game is perfect in every aspect. From the mechanics, to the campaign map and to the stunning battlefields, everything will just blow you away. That's what it's been doing for 5 years now.
4559	1	a	Started playing Empire again and found it just as addicting as before. Forget Civ or any other war campaign game, this is the true game for warfare on a global scale.
4561	1	a	I am a long-time student of linear warfare - the American Civil War and War of the Revolution in particular. However I have been fascinated with the evolution of linear tactics over the ages as well. The Total War series of computer games I believe provides an easy-to-learn illustration of how linear tactics have evolved. The game also provides a format for role-playing on the national policy level which, in this day and age, is important for citizens to understand as we watch what is happening on the news.  Empire is a very good tool with which to learn and gain understanding of how nations were built and why our globe functions as it does today.
4563	1	a	Has done a pretty good job of developing on earlier games and updating them to a later historical era, including colonisation of new continents and worldwide trade, implemented better than I've seen anywhere else (better than seen in AOE3, for example). All in all, probably the best strategy game for that time period, but at this stage in the franchise, that's about what we've come to expect from Total War. Plenty of content and options, but not too much as to be overwhelming.
4565	1	a	I love this game, it's challenging, and the happiness system is cool. Now if only I had the patience to play through more than a handful of battles at once...
4567	1	a	Hey guys, quick question!. When i play Empire , everything goes well, until after the first 200 turns. Once i hit the 1800 mark , after i finish my turn , the game decides to stall on one country and it takes forever I.E. The Maratha Confederacy . It literally takes between 5 minutes to I ♥♥♥♥ you not 6 hours before i can keep playing. I have a decent laptop and it works great with Napoleon and other total war games. So , What's going on here? has this happened to anyone else? Appreciate some feedback guys. Thanks
4569	1	a	A really good game, large map with america,india and europe and you can play as prussia and pwn everything
4571	1	a	this is an old game but i still play it all the time, such a good game i think, best total war game out by far.
4573	1	a	Any fan of the Total War series should play Empire: Total War. The game takes a whole new approach to the Total War gameplay. Naval Battles are one of the better additions.
4575	1	a	An Aweome stratagy game, should be played more
4577	1	a	There are still a few bugs but in general I think the game is well worth the money spent if you like turn based strategy games. The batles are where most of the bugs are because the AI does really stupid stuff. However if you choose auto combat the game can be pretty fun on a grand scale. There are several campaigns to play and you can choose from several different nations and play in different languages... kinda neat but annoying as well because you can't turn the foreign language off. Different factions have different unique units also... some of them are neat and some are not. I have spent what I consider to be a lot of time playing this game and enjoyed most of it.
4579	1	a	Don't believe the bad press. This game is awesome!!
4581	1	a	One of the best strategy games ever.
4583	1	a	u are freaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if u dont own this game
4585	1	a	I got this game for free but i havent even beaten the tutorial...
4587	1	a	Guts and Glory, musket and cannon. You should play this and aim for total world domination. Too bad that the multiplayer is dead.
4589	1	a	This is by far the best strategy game I've ever played. The battles get very intense and you dont need to muck skill to enjoy it like I did.
4591	1	a	I can't stop playing this game. ...Please, help.
4593	1	a	8/10 it is certainly one of the best stratregy games out there( probably beuz it is made by total war who r amazing and they fixed most of the problems in the game).  i like how they used more of range attacks though they could and in more melee death animations becuz sometimes when a person dies, they go into a animation for when they are shot. though, the game is really impressive with its large northern hemisphere map and its large scale battle.  i think the AI could still use more tweaking becuz they sometimes seem suicidal.   in conclusion, this is a great game for 20 dollars but if u are looking to spend more on a more refined game get Shogun 2. 
4595	1	a	You establish a true global Empire in this game. Simply awesome.
4597	1	a	Empire: Total War is one of the best strategy game I have ever played. You can play on a a turn-by-turn campaign map as a major imperial faction in the 18th century. You may expand cities, establish trade routes, manage taxes, and so many other things to do. Should you need to fight the enemy, you could autoresolve the conflict or you cold go into real-time to use cunning tactics and force to defeat your enemy. The same applies to naval battles. You can command realistic 18th century ships on the high seas. You can also play through the Road to Independence, a historical campaign from Jamestown, to the French-Indian War, to the American Revolutionary, and finally to establishing America as a real nation. I highly recommend this game to strategy gamers and fans of the 18th century.
4599	1	a	Empire total war is a brilliant strategy game about my favourite period in history:the eighteenth century. As in other total war games you start of on the campaign map that is similar to the civilization games, but when you encounter an enemy on the map you go into a real time strategy battle with large armies of various kinds of soldiers , naval battles, fort sieges, and land battles. Fantastic game I love it
4601	1	a	very great RTS with huge battles on an epic scale. Great for those who enjoy Risk, The Civilization series, or even the past total war games.  Pros -Graphics are amazing -Lots of mods, I recommend (Darth mod) -Big battles -Sound is great -Refreshing new take on the Total war series  Cons -A.I is really dumb -Requires a pretty hefty machine to get the fullest out of the game. -A bit buggy  9/10
4603	1	a	Love the game with all the mods
4605	1	a	A decent game with many flaws. Install a overhaul mod to get past some of the flaws and bear with the rest. You'll find yourself with hours of fun.
4607	1	a	119 total hours played thus far.. I play this game a lot and i love it..!!!
4609	1	a	An amazing game that includes both detailed naval and line battles, as well as a nice Grand Campaign. This game does, however, have many glitches in battles and the campaign, and AI is not that smart at all. I overall recommend if you are interested and strategy and tactics.
4611	1	a	great gunpowder action, more realistic charges and reactions of cavalry, this one is really awesome in terms of head-on rifle fighting. “Don’t fire till you see the whites of their eyes!
4613	1	a	Another excellent example of the Total War series at it's best. It does on occasion get to be too much for my little Gateway from Walmart's capabilities but that will not sour my appetite for re-enacting the birth of our nation in full, violent Total War style. I particularly enjoy the levels of realsm and immersion based details that seem to dominate the series. An introduction into real naval combat, other than just for transportation is challenging but very rewarding. The DLC's are good and a worthy addition to the base game. I wouldn't go without them as it seems a bit one sided to pay only as the Europeans and not the Native Americans on the War Path DLC. But as in history, I guess to be totally accuratem don't be expecting to dominate right away with the Natives as it was challenging with limited access to firearms and artillery, it will be a struggle intially where stealth is key when using only bows and tomahawks vs. muskets with bayonets and artillery fire. But don't et the challenge seem daunting, any TWC vet worth their salt can lick the British invaders from the Native lands!
4615	1	a	One of the crown jewles in the Total War series. These guys could make a killing if they ever released a 'World: Total War' and made it modable.
4617	1	a	Epic battles, World conquering fun!
4619	1	a	Do I need to say anything?
4621	1	a	Be good if i can multiplay with a PC if i use a mac
4623	1	a	Re-doing this reccomendation after 32 hours with the game. It's tons of fun, even if the battles are a bit slow, the overall feel of everything is fantastic, and the feel of the ship battles is spot on. A bit slow on my computer, I still enjoy the grand campaign.
4625	1	a	Extremely interesting and entertaining game, great continuation of the Total War series. High recommended for fans of Rome: Total War, Age of Empires, Hearts of Iron etc.   Plenty of fun, you will get your moneys worth with this title.
4627	1	a	Extremely interesting and entertaining game, great continuation of the Total War series. High recommended for fans of Rome: Total War, Age of Empires, Hearts of Iron etc.   Plenty of fun, you will get your moneys worth with this title.
4629	1	a	Its not total war, i mean there's other stuff in the game too ya know.
4631	1	a	Second best out of all second generation total war series.
4633	1	a	This is the first total war series that I play   This game make me love total war series   I still remember when attacking enemy ships, stormed the enemy soldiers, enemy castle, and destroy nation   and this is total war  with many countries in the world  and tens of thousands of troops in one map  total war is total war  p.s. the only problem is this game makes my pc's hot
4635	1	a	Very good game and entertaining. But they need to fix the bugs
4637	1	a	This game is absolutley fantastic, as part of the Total War series it is by no means the best... however it is not the best. The games mechanics are okay at best, the main fun from this game comes from the fact that you are able to fight in 3 differnet theatres of war. The ability to start as a european nation such as Sweden or Prussia and have that nation expand to have colonies in America and India is immensly good fun. The line infantry combat is not perfect but is still enjoyable.  Overall i would rate this game at 7/10. It loses points for me due to the fact it feels like CA took on more than they could chew and the line infantry combat is not fully up to scratch for me. It does however game points for me down to the customization options(Naming Regiments) and the freedom to exapand your empire to America and India
4639	1	a	More management in campaign if you compare to Napoleon, the combat is a bit slower but makes it rather interesting when you have played a lot of Napoleon or Shogun 2 :)
4641	1	a	its just really fun guys
4643	1	a	Epic Total War in an epic time period. Can't get enough.  Also: use Darthmod.
4645	1	a	im to the point where my game freezes every time i end turn and it is iritating other than that the game is fun when it works
4647	1	a	Empire total war is good except it does not include the whole world map to play with also Total war series should release a new game with more good ruling system for the empire like the game should have more things to build in the region in the city and all of that should be custom.
4649	1	a	Satiate your hunger for world conquest. Manage the economy, sciences, diplomacy and military. And like always, field and command vast numbers of troops on the field of battle! Go out, and conquer the world! I like kicking butt with a Native American tribe. Conquer the world with the Indians!  My only regret is that South America, Africa and Asia are not included in the game. I want to be the Incan god of the world, not just the Andes!
4651	1	a	While this game can prove to be buggy, and a bit irritatiting at times (especially in naval combat), the overall experience is unique and intuitive, with the increasing importance of artillery and ranged combat changing the dynamic of the traditional battle formula.
4653	1	a	Ive been a fan of Total War since Medieval 1 was released. Empire and med 2 are still the games i return to again and again, i play Shogun 2 and Rome 2 but i think the game play and feeling of Empire should be looked at if the Total war gang ever think about a Medieval 3 (please dont mess it up) Shogun2/Rome2 i can take or leave but my life would have had big void without Medieval and Empire. im off now to put them Damn Yankies back in their place
4655	1	a	This is a astonishing grand strategy game. The combat is awesome and well-polished, the overland map is well developed, and it is the only total war game to feature the whole world to date, the only problem is that they haven't made a sequel for it.
4657	1	a	An awesome strategy game, It does not hold your hand in any way, leaving you nearly infinite strategies to use to conquer your opponents
4659	1	a	I've spent so many hours on this game. The campaign mode is super addictive(addicting?). The battles are amazing, as well. Strategy works in this game. Flanking is my main means of victory, rout the enemy like no other. It's an amazing game, tons of mods that I don't know how to use, and even playing with friends is fun.
4661	1	a	Empire Total War is by far my favorite strategy game. The game play is superb and the campaigns last for hours and are really fun. I have played this game for way longer then I should have but this game is so addicting that I don't actually care. I have played this game for awhile and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
4663	1	a	This game is really fun in all honest if you like historical games this one is for you. Now in someways this game is more complex yet more streamlined than the other Total Wars diplomacy is much easier to do and it gives you a warning when you're about to go into debt which could happen very easily in the past Total War games. I recommend this game very much.
4665	1	a	real good rts and turn based. Naval combat is a good addition  Good graphics
4667	1	a	Very enjoyable game. This was my first game that I had ever put over 100 hours into.   9/10
4669	1	a	Empire: Total war is, in my opinion, the weakest of the games in the Total War franchise (though I haven't played Total War: Rome 2 yet which have received some negative reviews as well).  This game can be quite frustrating at times, especially with a fairly weak AI and a diplomatic system which feels like it makes no sense with nations fighting by even when offered very favourable terms in face of complete eradication. Especially fighting in siege battles can be really annoying on both sides as the units behave remarkably stupid in those scenarios.  Still, despite all of it's flaws I will still recommend the game because I've enjoyed playing it a lot, especially the naval battles brought a new element to this franchise which was sorely missing from previous titles (and they are bloody fun to play!). And, perhaps more crucially, this game fills a still quite vacant spot in the set time-period in the strategic games category.  So, if you like strategy games, especially the other in the Total War franchise and can survive a few bugs and a quite annoying AI then you can pick up this one up.
4671	1	a	a continuation of the Total War games, you play as one of the world powers in 3 theatres of war, Europe, America and India during the time of Elizabeth II and the American Civil War. Will you put down the War for Independence or conquer the world as one of the civilizations?
4673	1	a	I really love this game. Lots of reply-value and fun times all around.
4675	1	a	This is one of my favorite strategy game.
4677	1	a	Amazing played as Britain and absorbed the colonies, killed off sweden, and invaded paris with the nights watch all in one sitting.
4679	1	a	Empire, the first time we all got to the see the dream killing warscape engine. For those of you looking for a great total war video on its many problems I recommend Dr. Reynold Sanity on youtube. If you can stand Australian cynical and somewhat offensive humor he makes a lot of great points. Nails it on the head.  For the price I would pick the game up but just watch your calavary chase after a routed unit and yea..... Watch as the entire unit chases one man while the others run in the opossite direction and then just sit around. Even after uncountable patches this game is still rather messy. The AI while no longer creating armies of 7 cannons and a single skirmisher (not all the time) is a bit better, they are still pretty bad even by total war standards. On the plus side they will form large fleets and armies. Id ignore the campain all together. It culminates in fighting a British army who only buys native horse musketmen who are the best guys you want to gaurd a fort and man the wall.   Random agent spawning is frustrating as well. Still if you like the time period get it or napoleon. Stay away from Rome 2. While many praise shogun 2 for its polish it is still hurt by the warscape engines lack of collision detection and only allowing 1vs1 melee. Enjoy watching your men circle a single unit and get cut down one at a time.   For the last great melee total war you want medievil 2. Although Shogun is pretty solid. They just need to really overhaul or just go back to the old engine with better looking models.  Still have to recommend.
4681	1	a	The feeling of cutting down a charge of hundreds of men while taking no losses yourself is indescribable to anyone who hasn't felt it. Buy this game.
566	0	a	Not my cup of tea
4683	1	a	Is really fun but takes a while to Install 
4685	1	a	The Empire strikes back...........literally. 11/10 would play as the Brits again.
4687	1	a	Ok I should start by saying I actually love the total war series that I have played so far albeit that only includes Shogun 2 and now Empire for me, of which my friends who are into this genre tell me are the best of the total war franchise so far. I have only played 3-4 hours so far so this is more of a first look.  Empire for the sale price was in my opinion a damn good buy, It defiantly adds plus points for value, I’m not sure I would have been happy if I paid full price for this when it first came out though. There are a few bugs and glitches that do make for a laugh but honestly after this long I would have expected them patched out.  Some bugs I have encountered so far include my troops refusing to stand down or hold a line, and this really annoying one where when you try to move groups of troops at the same time some will just walk off into the void, the target line for their positioning is nowhere near where you clicked and often in a completely opposite direction, meaning you have to micromanage your troops when you shouldn’t have to, it kinds of breaks the fun of commanding an army when you have to look at each person and tell them…hey you go there, you over there, you follow him etc.   This game is heavy on forward planning and strategy, it is important to move your troops into strong positions and either advance on the enemy or wait for them to come to you. There is also the world map from which makes different style of play, this is fun as you can engage in diplomacy and lay siege to forts rather than have to play each battle if you don’t want to (though you can engage each one if you choose).   The ship combat is fun and has lots of different weapons and tactics to employ in order to gain the advantage, although the path route problem sometimes rears its ugly head again so you end up micromanaging each ship, and even then you have to keep an eye on it to make sure it is doing what you want.   The setting is in the colony era for America and I have to say always one of the more interesting historical periods, there is a lot of lore about all different unit types, the battles themselves and the ships of which I have a good interest.  If you are into strategy, or history or both then this will probably interest you, I would pick it up on sale though as paying more than £10 for this would be a mistake in my opinion.   I’ll definably be taking more of a look into this and may update this once I have tried the grand campaign out.  
4689	1	a	A great game that has been around for a while! Starting out in the 1700's, you choose a nation from around the world to be in charge of. From there, you upgrade your military, industries and knowledge via education as you try and stay ahead of the rest of the planet while increasing the size of your empire by conquering other nations and their territories.  Use the world map to make major moves. Decide battles automatically or actually go into the fight and direct the whole thing! Great graphics either way.  Raise money through taxes or by selling knowledge to foreign countries.   Hours of play-time.
4691	1	a	Amazing addition to the Total War series. Great turn based strategy game and love the political elements. The battles are amazing to watch high quality and strategy plays a huge role, more so than in past games in my opinion with the addition of firearms being the main weapons at work here. Awesome construction system and economic development system easy to pick-up had trouble my first two campaigns then started to get a feel for the game. I was awful at Shogun, but if you're intelligent and can learn how to work around your weaknesses it is a great buy at this price. Fun for a quick play or a long period of time. If you are into this type of game you know who you are and I would say buy it! 9/10 for the genre overall probably a 7/10 since it doesn't appeal to everyone. GREAT DEAL!!!
4693	1	a	GREAT GAME! could be made better with mods tho
4695	1	a	Good game. Very detailed and good strategy. Just one problem. Takes up waaaaaay too much space. It got uninstalled one day because of space.
4697	1	a	The epicness of seeing the cannonballs fly into the ranks of your enemies is just spectacular. Even just a handful of volleys from my line infantry can change the outcome of a battle and i especially love crashing into the enemies with my elephants when i use the Maratha Confederacy! the only 2 things i don't like about this game is that the cities are more like forts and the doors on them are terrible, my guys were stuck on the door for half the battle.
4699	1	a	It is very fun and exiting, and has lots of suprises.
4701	1	a	Empire: Total War is a very good strategy based game. The campaign is set up like a board map, with options for you to simulate or play in the battles. The senarios are pretty fun, but can be challenging depending on the difficulty the game is set on. The 'Play Battle' game modes are what I have spent most of my time playing and those have kept me happy with the game. The graphics are decent and the sound effects are alright and there is virtually no lag what so ever. I would recommend this game if you like playing long battles, thinking like you are playing chess, or have a love for strategy based games in general.
4703	1	a	Asolutely love this game. Endless replay value, while picking up a fair amount of historical facts as well.
4705	1	a	Like 'Total War' with guns. -IGN
4707	1	a	10/10. Just look at how many hours I have played already!
4709	1	a	It was ok.
4711	1	a	Like all 'Total War' games, the game must use mods. More so with Empire as the finished game plays more like that arcade game you used to play in the fish n chips store. I would recommend 'Darthmod' as a complete overhaul of the game. Turns Empire into how it was meant to be.  Not entirely stable. Especially with mods, but worth it.  Make sure you can run the game smoothly with unit scale set to max to get the best gameplay.
4713	1	a	good , but crashes a lot, for some reason in the best part of the game.
4715	1	a	Very enjoyable still think its the best Total War so far
4717	1	a	Not as good as Rome or Medieval but still a great total war game 8/10
4719	1	a	Awesome. Definetly reccommended
4721	1	a	Evrything's incredible except for when moving units into and out of buildings, also with sieging forts, that's all very buggy but everything is is fantastic.
4723	1	a	With 564 hours played on record, it's my second most favourite game. It's just so much fun to conquer the old european, america and middle-east territories while lining up the infantry, horses and artillery.   In short, why is this game so good? - Nice graphics - Easy to learn the mechanics, and yet challeging enough to keep playing - Send a million men to their grave, and get an achievement for it
4725	1	a	My all time favorite game! I wish they would make Empire 2!
4727	1	a	    BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!     No For Real One of The Best 5/5 Stars  Best Regards-  KStone111  
4729	1	a	Really great game if you are looking for a good 18-century battle/managment game
4731	1	a	Best game of the Total War Series, except for Attila for I have not played it yet. Mechanics are great, sea battles are intense, and the scale is amazing. 9/10
4733	1	a	Really nice combat emersion
4735	1	a	My favorite Total War game, looks great ands set in an interesting era. It's a must-buy game if you like strategy games.
4737	1	a	Would definately reccomend this game, great diplomacy system, amazing battle scenes and overall a really good game.
4739	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX9XFuBpHVQ  Part 1, Lasts around 12 minutes.Focuses on the Grand Campaign  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a82HR3JMYKM  Part 2.Also lasts around 12 minutes.Focuses on land and naval battles 
4741	1	a	I think it is a fun game you can be the united states and take over america you can be many old factions
569	0	a	DO NOT BUY!  This game is impossibly broken still, after all these years... The AI makes little sense most of the time, but by far the worst are the siege battles. Most battles they sit outside my walls refusing to attack, only occasionally sending one or two units forward to die. This means your game session has what basically comes down to 20-minute pauses every single time someone sieges your cities, while you sit there fast-forwarding...  Equally annoying is the RNG auto-resolving battles. It doesn't matter at all how large your force is or by what margin you could win if you fought the battle yourself; you can easily end up losing 1000 troops to a 300-strong enemy force if the RNG gods demand it!  To top it off there are actually performance issues on my 2-month-old and very powerful new PC. This COULD have been a good game, but is badly let down by its stupid AI. This has completely turned me off ever buying another Total War game...   DO NOT BUY!
4743	1	a	This is an excellent game and a period of history that was dynamic and interesting. I'd go as far as to say my favourite Total War game.
4745	1	a	This game is really fun, I've blown a lot of time in Empire. There's really nothing like having muskets and lines of infantry! However, be warned that this game still isn't as good as Shogun 2- especially with the DLC. But, it's still a fun game none the less.
4747	1	a	Great game definetely recommended.Try out darthmod or imperial splendour, you will be blown away!
4749	1	a	It is a fantastic game with a lot of factions and more continents like America
4751	1	a	If you enjoy your history, you will enjoy this game...
4753	1	a	love this game
4755	1	a	fun custom battles
4757	1	a	This game is just unbeleivable. I have never even played an RTS before Civ V;if that counts as one.   But oh my god, I think I may be an RTS nerd now. Its just so fun, and mind-blowing! Having massive battles with countless units and thousands of men, each one destinctly visible, is just AMAZING when you see it. It is addictive, fun, and just overall mind-boggling.   You could even say that it's'whack' or 'off the chain, dawg'. Yeah thats right, I just went there. I could not recommend it enough.
4759	1	a	.
4761	1	a	after 800k kills on the battlefield and 70% of the achievements (the rest are MP) I can say it is a game to play, sadly alot of things were improved in Napoleon, but the size of the map and the number of regions in ETW makes this the best game ever, I allways hoped they would make expansions so that the 'Trading colonies' would become part of the actual map, sadly they never thought of doing so.  if you are into strategy games that can take almost forever by your own choice, this is the one to go for, especially if you can bother yourself to an .ESF editor for the purpose of changing the calender from 2 turns per year into 12 or whatever you want to do otherwise... then you can really just sit back and watch the world evolve if you feel like not taking part int the bid for power.   Best TW ever IMO. some things in Napoleon as I said were improved, graphics especially when it came to battles and cannon impacts etc. But also in the fact you could rebuild buildings instead of haveing to tear something else down and then build, their general recruitment and injury/recovery system was better IMO, the thing that saddened me was that the campaign map had shrunk although the world was technically even bigger than during the ETW time period of 1700-1799, by the 1805-1815's as in Napoleon TW, Most of Africa was colonized, most of South America was colonized AND the great western railway was only 17 years from its beginning of construction, ALL of North America would have been part of the game if it stood to me, Furthermore by the 1790's the British Empire had put alot of effort into the Chinese empire, which by then also should have been part of the game but wasn't.  Imo instead of a crummy little game like their newest game Total War: Atilla they should have made an Empire TW 2: The Global Empire, including everything from 1700 to 1850, including the 1770 discovery of 'Terra Australis' or well rediscovery as it ofcourse was :D IMO, they claim to be soo historically correct, but they are only up to the point that they can make their deadlines.
4763	1	a	I have no life, would like to see more dead troops.
4765	1	a	Most solid total war ever made, wish they would make a second one
4767	1	a	
4769	1	a	alot of fun if you are a history buff or enjoy fun stergety games this is a game for you 10/10
4771	1	a	Amazing game that depicts teh revolutionary warfare time period. If you are a revolutionary enthusiast like m, you will love this game.
4773	1	a	awsome game really!!
4775	1	a	good game but the campagin is good but u get not alot of money
4777	1	a	This is one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend this to anyone.
4779	1	a	dispite the claims empire tw is a 'Broken game' i think it is quite the opposite and i have lost many hours to its funfactor emersed in colonial europe with ym glorious englishmen gunning down thoses american peasant rebles anyway bacl too the review the game plays well ive seen no bugs batlles last a good time not short and often slugging to the last man i love grity tw and ai is fairly agressive but no match for me even on the highest diffuclty but it lacks ib mp as it has no coop which it would be sensational too have overall i give it 8/10
4781	1	a	An awesome Total. The units are amazing and so are the factions.
4783	1	a	One of my favorite games ever. I started with Sweden. I decided to take over Denmark. Once i fully took over Denmark's territory, I headed to America. I took over almost all of the Colonys there,but I had to war with France and Spain.After I had full control of my colonies and formed and aliance with Britian.When I started back on my empire in Europe I decided to unite St. Petersburg with my main area,soo I invaded Russia in winter and won. The Russians still control the southern part of their empire and me and the Ottomans are closing in on them.  10/10 would make a Swedish Empire again!
4785	1	a	This is one of the best Total War Games out there. There are so many diffrent factions that each provide a unique gameplay experiance. It is complex enough that it is interesting but not so complex that you get bogged down in the micromanaging of your empire. If you are an experienced Total War player or a beginner I would highly recommend this game.
4787	1	a	For me it was a very enjoyable introduction to the Total War series. It encouraged me to go on to buy Shogun 2, Rome and Napoleon.  Give it a try :)
4789	1	a	Good Game Love IT
4791	1	a	I only have Rome Total War 1 and this. They are both great games, but Empire is clearly the best for me. I love the theme of line infantry and the sight of the cannons rolling back with smoke coming from their barrels. I also love the naval battles, however these can become an anoyance, for example, trying to transport mutiple trade ships to Africa, but the french just keep sending fleets at you. Great game overall, however the factions all seem to alike. I also love the option to have a revolution, change to a republic or monarchy and get a new flag!   9/10; an easy score for a great game
4793	1	a	one of the best total war games out there
4795	1	a	It isa complicated at first but it is fun. once you start to get it it becomes an challenge to do better. Overall once you get to handle it is the best game in the total war universe from my experience.
4797	1	a	is ight
4799	1	a	Great Game
4801	1	a	TO MANY BUTTHURT AI -900000/10
4803	1	a	Despite having no playtime on this account, I've played this quite a bit on my own, now hoping to get back into it. While it's definetly not my -favorite- Total War Game (That belonging to Rome I,) It is certainly a better title than most of the other titles in the series (Excluding Medival, and Rome I)   My only real issue is that, partly cause of this, they switched to that damn engine where he troops all fight eachother one at a time, despite how unrealistic that is.  It's a bit buggy, and takes time to learn, but if you can get around that you'll likely enjoy it. If you enjoy this game, I'd suggest Europa Universalis, Rome: Total War (Not II.), Medival: Total War.
4805	1	a	This game is action-packed, and based on strategy, for people who like RTS, I recomend this game.
574	0	a	Terrible AI always ends up ruining these games for me
4807	1	a	Easily the best Total War game on record. It had it's issues at the start, but this game I believe will stand as the one of the defining Total War games for many years.  Unlike the Rome: TW which spanned Europe, North Africa and the western Middle East, Empire is a global game. You can build your empire on the Indian subcontinent, the North American colonies, and colonial Europe. Additionally, naval forces (which you can FINALLY control like ground troops) have four 'trade route' locations they can operate in on top of the 3 main theaters.  I would highly recommend this game.
4809	1	a	This game is a very good game historicaly and gameplay, ive had many hours of enjoyment and certainly encourage you buying the small expansion packs. also i like it how there are still multiplayer servers since its an old-ish game
4811	1	a	love this game buy it now
4813	1	a	Took over the world as British, a glorious campaign, 10/10 would do it again!  Playing around with different factions and trying different tactics makes this game easily replayable. Loosing many hundreds of hours into it easy.   Total War series is popular for its large scale battles, with muskets and baynets its no different, gloriously executed, and well made. Capturing the era wonderfully.   I love unleashing cannon bombardments on enemy fortifcations! Boomtastic!
4815	1	a	The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started.
4817	1	a	One of The Best Total Wars Out there.... Great battles, Great Campaign, leading your men through victory as they line battle the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other. Its also first contact on ship battles so they did alright for it. Could be a bit better but a definet thumbs up for this game!
4819	1	a	I got steam to play this game back when everyone hated steam because you needed it to play this game. Coming back to it after years of break I have to say it really does live up to the nostalgia (though maybe not fully, there's no longer the secndary school lessons to ignore while me and my friends discuss our latest exploits as Britain beating the damned frogs, but that is not the game's fault - rather a symtop of getting older).  The campagn is one of the best in the Total War series mathed, in my oppinion, only by Napoleon. You play as a nation across 3 campaign maps that are vibrant and filled with smaller towns outside your cities. This gives the whole game a much more upbeat and immersive feel to the earlier Rome.  Battles are great in the way that Total War games are.   Though many of the things in this game were improved on and developed in Napoleon this game gives a wonderful experiece of the enlightenment era through the eyes of the military that you don't find anywhere else - it offers smething much more pretty and in depth that the grand stragegy games of Paradox and its a much more historical and cohesive experiece than other historical games. Empire hits a sweet spot between complexity and polish that makes it a wonderful game to this date,
4821	1	a	Good game, wish you could play all factions w/o modding and the Grand Campaign was more balanced, but still one of CA's best titles. Play it.
4823	1	a	Best Total War! The Greatest RTS Game of ALL Time! If you don't have Empire Total War, then your Computer Sucks!
4825	1	a	This game was stunning thanks Creative Assembly !!!!!
4827	1	a	great game fun for hours 
4829	1	a	This game is 10/10.
4831	1	a	this game is very very very good as you can travel around the world forging your empire :p
4833	1	a	I have been playing this game since it came out. Its 2015 and Im still playin it. I have a bunch of different mods for it. My favorite is AUM 3.4 This is the best toal war game. Ive played them all. I will continue playin it until either steam folds or my clock runs out.
4835	1	a	the game is fun while not the best in the whole franchise its easy to pick up and play except for the ship battles those are confusing along with some it loking like its runing off of a ps2
4837	1	a	Probably the finest total war game done. the system was easy to use. Quick to learn very hard to master and it feels balanced and rewarding. Who doesnt enjoy wiping out the French as Britain or stabbing Great Britain in the back with the United Provinces. Employ diplomacy as you quench your Thirst for glory and conquer the World.    
4839	1	a	Conquered the world twice. :D  Loved it
4841	1	a	GAME IS BEST TOTAL WAR
4843	1	a	Disclaimer: I am a Total War fanatic; Now that I have said this, Empire is not the pillar of the series; but still it is a solid and deep stratagy game even after 6 years. The main campaign is ok, but the Grand Campaign is one of the strongest of the series, and much of the asethetic makes the Victorian Era come to life and a salute to Creative Assembly for creating a line infantry system that works fantastically, but in retrospective the system seems completely achieveable, but in 2009 the system was ahead of it's time.  8.25/10
4845	1	a	empire total war is the best strategy game that ill ever play in my life :D
4847	1	a	Of all the Total War games, including the ones that came out after (Shogun, Rome 2, Atilla, Napoleon) this is arguably my favorite and I continually come back to it.  A good mix of technology research, trade domination, diplomacy, underhanded tactics, and the raw brute strength of regiments of men marching across three continents creates a broad sweeping game in the hey-day of the European race to Empire. With the great addition of the Warpath campaign, this game gets even better.  It is mostly mod friendly, and the American Campaign acts as a good tutorial.  The only thing negative I can say about this game is that it would be nice to play and start out as the fledgling United States or British Colonies. The closest you can get is starting out as Britain itself.
576	0	a	Update: Game is prone to crashing regularly in a long campaign game. Makes it unplayable even after the starting few turns of play. Can be stabilized after a few graphics tweaks but both crashes and corrupts saves often enough to discourage play. ***NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL RESOLVED ***  Empire Total War (E:TW) is a RTS set in the 1700's. It has a single player campaign mode on a strategic map which add to the game greatly (and therefore is a shame that is not multiplayer). A worthy successor to the Total War series and an excellent historical battle simulator.   Graphics are much improved over Mediaeval and Rome TW but the movement controls are worse as the system struggles to path and place units according to their formation and position units around cover: you can often find a unit moving accross the map to nowhere. Indeed AI is generally extremely problematic: units have more of a tendency to not follow movement orders once engaged; units can be blithely matching through enemy ranks as a pitched battle occurs around them; troops will march in front of their own cannons and get killed; horse carriages will go over obstacles (like cannon emplacements and get killed).  Also the campaign game forces storyline battles on you. I had just finished capturing Canada from the French and was ready to re-enter real life when I was thrown into Bunker Hill without warning or explanation and had to fight another battle: a battle I subsequently lost because I had to stop the game and was not allowed to save the game. I had to beat the French in Canada four times before I got the game to a save point where I had won Bunker Hill. This is done for the sake of storyline momentum but but there would have been no harm putting in a save point.  This lack of attention to player experience in interface and storyline is seen also in the exposition in the in-game help. Nowhere does it say that unit will fire into their own troops or how this operates (sometimes they do, sometimes they hit their own troops, sometimes only the enemy), nor how to cancel a building destruction/construction order, how cover works and how units wrap around them, how to cancel a broadside, why are only the first line of troops firing etc. Forums help here but a few more tool tips wouldn't go astray as the experience of using gunpowder weapons is different to the previous more melee centric TW series; archers can arc over troops but muskets travel a flatter trajectory after all.  On broadsides, ship battles are very well done. I haven't player other ship simulators since Port Royal, but it was very satisfying demasting a ship. Again, not a lot of exposition, like that the compass actually refers to wind direction.  Individual unit animations are very good and troops will even jump over obstacles.  Loading times are very slow and the system does not quite know how to handle two monitors.  In all, a very good game that is puntuated by poor AI, poor exposition, forced stroyline battles you cannot save, and no restart button as in other TW games.
4849	1	a	Fun game that I have sunk perhaps too many hours into it.  Pros: Numerous special units for every nation. Good looking visuals, from musket smoke to heat distortions. Quick battles are a fun way to attempt at recreating your own 18th century historical battles. AI can sometimes be very challenging.  Cons: Sound effects are somewhat underwhelming for the vanilla game. Naval battles can be frusturatingly slow and tedious. AI can often times be incredibly stupid. (Sitting imobile outside of your fort for the entire 60 minutes as you wait for time to run out.) Melee attacks seem somewhat broken. I had an entire regiment of line infantry reduced by nearly half strenght by 1 enemy unit simply because melee only supports 1 v 1. So while 1 infantry is fighting another, all other infantry of that regiment stand by watching like movie henchmen.  All in all a fun game by itself, but I'd recommend downloading Darthmod to improve the visuals and add even more units.
4851	1	a	Love it!
4853	1	a	i love this game i recommend this to newcomers and fans of the series
4855	1	a	Great game play it whenever I can
4857	1	a	Best Game I have ever played could play forever.
4859	1	a	play as france go allied with Britain train more than 1500 troops surround britain declare war capture it in 2 turn  damn im better than Napoleon
4861	1	a	ONE OF THE BEST RTS 2010 GAME AROUND
4863	1	a	This game is bittersweet, no other game covers the same timeline and has the same gameplay. I wish Empire didn't have so many bugs and poor design choices but it does. I still like it but I think the devs needed more time to properly make it. The AI is dumb and so is the dipolmacy, the troops also bug out constantly. The game almost requires some mods to fix these problems but when it is fixed the game feels a lot better. As a whole I'd recommend it if you're interested in the 1700's and if you do buy this game I'd strongly recommend using a mod like Darthmod to improve alot of the gameplay and make the game feel whole.  I say again; THIS GAME REQUIRES DARTHMOD TO UNLOCK ITS FULL POTENTIAL!
4865	1	a	Great start for the new generation of Total War!
4867	1	a	best game every 
4869	1	a	Not too bad as a game, I just could not get myself to conquer the whole map yet. Yes, fire by rank, when your line infantry obliterate the enemy lines using this firing method, its glorious!   There are many things that annoy me in this game (like diplomacy) but the worst thing I can think of is the way soldiers fight. No matter how many men are involved in combat there are only 1v1 fights (duels) so no backstabbing or whatever.
4871	1	a	One of the best strategy games out there.
4873	1	a	Easily one of the best Total War games in terms of scale. The size of the campaign maps (there are 3) are very impressive. The battles ae as like the other games, huge number of troops and tactics are essential, however there are still issues with Siege battles, especially deploying troops onto the walls.    To change the battle mechanics from Close combat and arrows to Guns and close combat has been done very well in this game. There are still plenty of options in terms of formations, alternative weapons and even props to be used in battle (spikes, ditches etc) adds another dynamic to the game.   This game is better than the later Napoleon Total War in terms of scale, yet there are troops that are dangerously similar to other nations but mods attends to this issue.    get the game, it iwill take up so many hours of your life and there is nothing more exciting than taking over the Americas using the Ottoman Empire, imagine if that did actually happen in our history... Well you get to make your own history in this game.
4875	1	a	It seemed a bit off in the beginning coming from medieval 2 and rome 1 , but checking some gameplay from DipplexHeated and lionheartx10 taught me how to fight in the 18th century and after that, oh boy. Best total war imho, even better than Medieval 2 , because of the grand scope of things, Lots of mods, especially Darthmod is a must . Actually this game made me appreciate and fall in love with a time period i had not the slightest idea what was all about. So yeah. I actually don't hope for an Empire 2, seeing how they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the total war series, im hoping for some other developer to get the idea and make a new game. That would bring tears of joy in my eyes. Totally worth the price and the time .
4877	1	a	One of the best if not the best strategy game ive ever played. Complete control over all game aspects terrain range accuracy. it is very realistic and also historiclly correct. one of my favorite games so far
4879	1	a	great game. Really Really great with dlc
4881	1	a	Overall, great game, i strongly recemend this game if you love real time stratigy
4883	1	a	As long as you download A Proper Empire Terra Incognita, the game works great but then later on you might encounter your game crashing during a startup loading game screen but other than that I like this game.
4885	1	a	I really injoy this game as you can see in my profile picture my favorite nation i love using is the the 13 colonies(america). Try the demo and if you like it GET IT!!!!!!! is a really fun game.
4887	1	a	Great strategic game! You just gotta have a great pc build to handle the game requirments to play it smoothly. I'm always down to play this game anytime.
4889	1	a	install empires, download the 100% nessissary darth mod... enjoy carnage.
4891	1	a	Little late for a review, but I think it's time to put this game rightfully in the place of every person who calls themself a 'strategy gamer's' shelf. Excellent gameplay, of which can be increased tenfold by great mods such as Darthmod and such, absolutely one of the prettiest games I've played. If you like strategy, this game will take up a good 100+ hours of your life.
579	0	a	This game has memory issues! It's a great game, that I love playing, but it does crash often. The game uses way too much memory for the game engine it was made with, and it was made to run on a 32 bit operating system. It does not have the ability to use all the hardware that you may have available for your games to use, and so it has many issues with crashing. Great game, but the crashes make you want to never buy a game from Sega again. Hard to keep playing a game after you spend over 50 hours on a map, just to have it crash, and never be able to finish.
4893	1	a	Hours of fun. Play Med or hard level.
4895	1	a	All Total War games are the best. Like strategy? Then love this!
4897	1	a	kindly looks over the battlefield and smiles, the flanks are secure, the cannons are wailing away, your ally is holding their side, and your abushes are working. At this point you believe it is all in the bag and that the enemy general should simply hand in their formal resignation to their monarchg immediatly and then be killed for treas9on and cowardess.   You sit back and think 'soda' you go to your fridge and get a pepsi still smiling until you see your screen.   Your ambushes have been killed, your allys line is shattered, and your cannons have had a firm horse charge up the ♥♥♥. Being the quick tactictian you first look for the cause. Obviously it was your absence and your allys incompetence, but you look deeper, how did your incompetant ally get broken that quickly when they were safe before hand?   after a few seconds of searching the battle field you see what has caused this, one unit of Indian war elephants flanked him and then went beserk on his ♥♥♥♥. You sigh and quickly send a few men to kill this threat.  Next would be how your flanks became exposed enough for a quick cavalry blitz onto your cannons, your mouth drops open as you see the tiny hole in your line infantry, a hit and run. After you close this hole you turn your attention to how your ambushes got thwarted.   You knew that the ambushes were temporary but you did not know the enemy would single them out and kill them vicously. Your eyes dart over the area that they were in, seems to your quick glance that the enemy had used light artys with some scout cavalry to do this, you send 1 units of scout cavalry to look for this.  In the meantime your units have murdered the elephants, HUZZA. your incompetant ally reforms his now rather small line, you order him to march foward. He says that might not be a great idea with the mens moral low, you insist that he goes in for the glory of your mother country. He sighs and moves his small rabble of troops forward.   You scouts have found the enemy artys and to your great pleasure they seem unguarded. You keep your scouts in cover and sneak them closer. you decide that YOLO does apply to cavalry charges and send them straight for the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. SUCESS, much rejoicing was done in the scout cavalry unit, they only lost half of their men! a sacrafice well worth it.  you get a skype call from the enemy, you are now smiling for you believe you can gloat for you victory. you answer and begin with, 'so now we both have no art'... your enemy is angry and exclaims that his mother country is better than yours, in disgust you kick him out of the call and focus on killing his troops with no rhyme or reason.  Suddenly the silence is broken by your mens screams of terror and pain, you look at your main line and your enemy just dropped gas on your whole clump of troops. The enemy mortars hiden so well at the back of them map are now pounding your troops with gas. Angered by this act of cruelty you send all cavalry units to deal with this threat.   You hear the whinying of your cavalry dying, more bloody Indian war elephants have appeared in mass and are having a mass bouty call on your cavalry. Between the gas and the elephants your men have been slaughtered. about 5 squads remain, you reform these precious troops together in some woods where your devilish enemy cannot see them.  3 skirmisher squads (two of which are out of ammo), one tenth of a heavy cavalry unit, and a random bunch of canon opperators who had fled after the horse charge who decided to stop fleeing. Pondering for awhile you come up with a plan to destroy the enemy.   sending your units through the woods you watch sympathetically as your ally is murdered by the enslaught of gas and elephants. He retreats after killing half of the elephants. He regroups his one unit with your group of lonely vaganbonds exclaimg that you told him to go forward and that you got him killed.. honwstly you dont really care, you congragulate him on killing half the elephants and tell him to buck up for the mother country. He bucks up, you then look at his one unit of sharpshooters which had been using melee during the whole battle and had not fired a single shot. Although this is stupid and you feel like you hsould chide your ally for his continual incompetance you realize this could be useful, you tell him to follow you.  You reach the elephant killing ground and send your two dud skirm troops up on melee mode, as per usual the elephants appear and charge, you tell your ally to use his sharps to fire. elephants begin to die in droves. in the meantime your cavalry units are probbing those damned mortars so hard. The enemys general begins to run across the map trying to make a wild goose chase. A signle satisfying round of cannon fire is heard as your mishmashed canonners fire the last shoot. THE PERFECT HIT, your twit of an advisor announces that the enemy general is nowinfact dead, a fact that you saw an enjoyed very much so. With this victory the enemy elephants evacuate the premises and the enemy has been slain.  Just another day in the life of a master strategist 10/10 would have my time wasted by dumb friends not being competant enough to hold their line vs one elephant again 
4899	1	a	You like Empires? You like Empires at war? 10/10 would kill pingrims again.
4901	1	a	My personal favorite total war game
4903	1	a	Great

4907	1	a	Review for Empire Total War  Empire Total War is a epic Grand Strategy game that features Real Time battles. Empire Total War in it’s release state was a disgrace to the Total War franchise. But since launch, Empire has improved to a very playable and fun game.   The game is based in the 18th century with the game starting in 1700 and ending in 1800. The game’s main focus is on the Real Time battles but it features more Grand Strategy than previous Total War games.   The Real Time battles are a joy to watch and play. But there are some problems with the battles, the most glaring is the AIs lack of strategic ability. I have had the AI knock down their own walls with cannons during siege battles.   The Grand Strategy part of the game is deeper in my opinion than any previous Total War game. In the Grand Strategy mode you can control your nation by doing various things like upgrading minor and major towns or hiring new ministers.   The diplomacy can be extremely annoying with the AI not giving you the technological equivalent of the wheel for a ballistic missile sometimes.   To fix most of these problems you can download the Darthmod mod. Darthmod’s main improvement is the AI. with darthmod even on medium difficulty the AI can be brutally efficient. Darthmod also increases the troop count to make bigger battles. Darthmod also adds smaller graphical improvements like musket and cannon smoke not dissipating for a long time.   Summary: This is a very fun Grand Strategy/Real Time Strategy hybrid that will deliver countless hours of enjoyment. It is worth every penny of $19.99, but if you aren’t sure about it you can download a free demo that showcases the battles.   
4909	1	a	Life, liberty, and the pursuit of colonies. -Prussian States of America
580	0	a	This has got to be the weakest Total War title I've ever bought.   I like the era, it's just that there isn't much strategy involved, it's pretty easy to just keep maneuvering your units into better firing positions. The fact it's the gun powder era isn't the problem, I've played Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai &amp; had a lot of fun, this however just doesn't play out well at all. It might just be that the setting doesn't interest me as much as a Japanese one, and the fact that there are little to none melee units to allow for more strategies.  The naval combat however is a blast. I definatly had a lot of fun playing naval battles. The ones on Empire are really a lot of fun, naval strategies is usually my weak point too.  But overall, in my opinion, the game is a bore. I'll keep trying to play it to try to find some enjoyment out of it, but I doubt I will, and will most likely return to another Total War game. - I'm gonna put the review as not recommended, but if you really like the era, &amp; wouldn't enjoy the more older fighting style Total Wars, then I'd recommend Empire to you.  Sidenote: I know I've only played four hours, but I'm finding it seriously boring.
4911	1	a	Play it... Love it
4913	1	a	Very fun game. Ai's diplomacy could've used some work. The Ai doesn't exactly think logically. But still, a very fun game, was able to bring Mother Royssia to glory.   7/10.
4915	1	a	This game is probaly the best stratergy game
4917	1	a	Challanging campaign and battle!, if you play on hard &gt;:D
4919	1	a	11/10 would make polish empire again
4921	1	a	It's pretty good as strategy games go. There are all kinds of formations you can put all your different squadrons in. Plus global domination.
4923	1	a	This game is pretty amazing i love it it really adds the feel of the revolutnary era with enhanced naval warfare combat can be annoying since guns are were mainly used then but overall this game is awsome i highly recommend playing it
4925	1	a	Things I liked:  - Great gameplay! The Campaigns are highly customizable and there are always new things to discover. - The strategy in this game is awesome. The battles are very realistic and commanding your troops is fun! - I have an affinity for this game because of how explorable it is; from alliances to war, you decide your future.  There is nothing about this game that I didn't like. I would like to see one made for the 1800's!
4927	1	a	turn limit on every game play mode is stupid as hell but other then that its fun
4929	1	a	If you like having 10 groups of 'mindless rabble' armed with pitchforks fighting against your groups of elite honor gaurd and massacring them, or having cannons armed with canister shots (turning the cannon into a giant shotgun) against militia men then this is the game for you.   10/10 would massacre helpless pitchforkers again
4931	1	a	Very good game for those who like grand, turn based strategy. In my opinion, the best game in the Total War series.
4933	1	a	One of my favorite games on steam
581	0	a	Worst game ı have ever seen. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ game!
4935	1	a	I enjoyed this game very much, but it does not match the standard that Europa Universalis IV presents. Europa, however, is not as much about war, so if your main focus is war, this is the game for you. If you enjoy grand strategy, how about giving Europa a look?
4937	1	a	Played as Russia. Ruled the waves, sands, forests, and all of thee above. The AI could have been better though, but...   10/10 would Putin again
4939	1	a	Yes - but only if very heavily modded.... Great potential, but a shoddy, rushed job -where the rushing really shows... Campaign 5/10, Sea Battles 7/10, Land battles 9/10 when heavily modded......
4941	1	a	Highly detailed turn based strategy. Battles are fun but can become tedious. Thankfully there is a sim button. Can spend hours playing it! Real fun
4943	1	a	Remember to bring a gun and you will survive...
4945	1	a	I absolutly love this game I have enjoyed every campaign more than the last and with 1000 hours on the clock that means alot. I think Sega should make a game like ETW and its twin NTW in the middle 1800's to the world wars to create a time with the evolution of the traditional calvary transformation into the tank and small battles of the modern day guerilla warfare that displays a map of the whole world, with concluding this I suggest to sega to work together with paradox plaza to create (GTW) Global total war.  ps. I hope my advice and expertice can help message or email me at  weroberts2001@icloud.com  for any questions about this game or any advice i can share with you and will be pleased to do so. 
4947	1	a	It keeps me healthy
4949	1	a	-Play as Sweden -Disband a percentage of the army (for the monis) -Gets Invaded by Poland,Russia and Denmark immediately.   10/10 would try to be neutral again.
4951	1	a	Right up my alley. Satisfaction, the ocasional nap! engrosing battles. Decent tech tree. Fun to screw with history. It's good to be da king! And payback's ooh baby. I love watching the AI eat it. Kinda like watching your cat screw up. Knowing someone saw it. Yep, was good for me.
4953	1	a	This game is great.  There is no other way to say it. It is fun, strategy, militaryistic game that has heaps of play time and potential. If you like the 1700's then you will love it. You can be heaps of different factions and it is pretty realistic. Great game. Absolutley love it.
4955	1	a	The game freezes too much
4957	1	a	One of the best Total war from the series.
4959	1	a	A game that I recommend with Turn-Based combined with Real-Time Strategy mechanics. Gameplay is pretty balanced. The Americas, Europe and India are the playable areas that you have access to, with small regions just for trading routes. Empire: Total War is so far, my favourite out of the Series.  Overall a great game that deserves a 9.5/10 Rating!
584	0	a	Sick and tired of game crashes! Although this is one hell of an awesome strategy game to play - it's not worth the frustration of dealing with the constant crashes. Too bad, could be an EPIC game with some serious tweaking by the software guys!
585	0	a	u cant play campaing mod with ur friend.I thought ı can ı bought now ı m sorry to ı bought
4961	1	a	Very adicting
4963	1	a	Amazing Campaign! Especially the 'Road to Independence'.
4965	1	a	Amazing the best Total war game there is.  All the expansion pack are awesome.  There is nothing to love about this game 9.5/10
4967	1	a	Brilliantly done, especially with the types mods across the internet. It really gives you the sense that you are commanding your own nation. Recommended to anyone who is interested in history and the idea of diplomatic relations.
4969	1	a	very good game would buy again.
4971	1	a	BEST strategy game I've ever played!
586	0	a	Game crashes after every few minutes. Had to redo a single fight like 8 times just to finish it. Next fight same story.... This game could be great if it would just play without crashing
4973	1	a	Played this game for hours when i first got it. Tons of fun. Its still fun to jump on every now and then. The UI is much better then most Total War games. One of the best In my opinion.
4975	1	a	Love the game something fierce. I defeated the Russian campaign on easy then I took the rest of the world for achievements. I had a blast with the game and highly recommend it. However I did have issues conquering the entire world however in a game pic I proved that it is possible. The game at several points wouldn't give me an end turn button and game crashed a few times as well... It took some doing. However for the most part it was mostly due to my empire being so freakishly large. The game works awesomely other wise. Takes some effort getting use to it. Also a word of advice playing the battles out can be a world of difference in most cases. Some if it says your going to win just auto it otherwise you could lose. However fight most of them out... Trust me. Very good game though. I highly recommend however you don't have to take my word for it... :D
4977	1	a	Possible the best game i've ever played. Its dosen't have any gore. Its better than napoloen total war. The only thing that would make it better, would be if there where more reason to start wars in the first place, like you could make laws for crimes you people do in your kingdom and empire. something to have more reason to take over other places. .You should also be able to ask your allies to move troops to another area. But its still a amazing game where you take over other areas just like the real rulers in the 1700s used to do. I also like how you convert other reglions into your reglion witch gives you a reason the take over other areas. It is a amazing game and a love it and still give it 10 out of 10.
4979	1	a	Firstly, I have been a long time fan of the Total War series and have played since Rome II and every subsequent title since. I can say that this expansion is easily within my top three favorite TW games. This game has a few typical flaws found in earlier TW games, but overall is a solid experience. I have a few personal preferences that some might find annoying, I shall still list these in the Pro's column as it's my review and I'll do what I want.    Pro    1) Diverse faction choives: TONS of factions to choose from, each with its own unique advantages/disadvantages. For example, the mryiad includes; the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain, The Iroquis Confederacy, and The Maratha Confederacy (to name a few). Unlike many TW games, the units are diverse and not merely rewraps of the same one unit.   2) Awesome Economy!: At first I struggled to find a decent balance between my army maint. and income level when I first started out. However unlike most TW games, where the economic balance can seem daunting to beginners, I found this title to be pleasently forgiving. For veteran players, be prepared to make a TON of money, especially through trading. I can not express how paramount trading in this TW title. One note that many will find annoying, to upgrade your farms, mines, etc. you must click on each indv resource that is located around the map. For example, in Shogun 2 your farms are located winthin your city, along with any extra resources, in Empire only your military/admin. building is and you are forced to keep track of literally dozens of different resources. I like this personally, simply because it is cool to see your empire become more prosperous.   3) Tons of land: Like tons, three different theatres; India, Europe and America. This means a lot of gameplay and conquering, oh the fun you'll have.     Cons   1: Stupid AI: The AI, like in many earlier releases, is not the most adpet at military combat. While sometimes I have been throughly suprised, I have never truly been threatened as I have in similiar titles playing on the hardest difficuly. Sadly, some of your major powers, like the Maratha Confederacy over time lose the ability to fight advanced troops like the Europeans.   2: Lag/Crash: I have yet to play a game through without experiencing three crashes. Some games have taken me 50+ hours and to be consistently crashing gets old fast. I will say it is nothing to pre-patched Rome II.   Consensus: If you are even a remote TW fan, then buy this game. You will have loads of fun and many hours to frolic across the world.
4981	1	a	The year is 1788.The American Colonies have been liberated from Britain. Trouble brews in the West; the Iroquois are not happy about our Victory. An American army moves in to prevent any attacks on major cities,as well as to make way for an invasion of Kaintuck.  The American army,1966 soldiers strong,assaults the Iroquois' main army,consisting of 1100 troops. After a few minutes of battle the Iroquois are routed,however it is too late; the Americans have encircled them. With nowhere to run,they make one last push to break the American lines.They fought to the last man. In total,the Americans lost 97 men.The Iroquois capital fell shortly after.  A few years later,in 1802,the Americans seek to claim the lands of Kaintuck and Upper Louisiana. Amid failed negotiations with France for Upper Louisiana,the Americans march an army to the borders of Kaintuck to scout it's defenses in preparation of a hostile takeover. They make a shocking discovery; Russia has taken over Kaintuck.  10/10 would destroy the Iroquois Confederacy to clear the way to capture Kaintuck only to have Russia foil the entire plan again. 
4983	1	a	Solid game, would rather play EU-IV, though.
4985	1	a	A very good all around great game. The bugs have been worked out and the game near perfect.
4987	1	a	if this game was a alien and it was a general controlling aliens it would be out of this world!. well this game isnt about aliens at all but its still out of this world awesome.
4989	1	a	Fantastic game that doesn't require an awesome computer to play. Has kept me up countless nights, hell bent on taking the known world as my own. It has a campaign map similar to Civilization with amazingly epic live action battles.
4991	1	a	When dungeons and dragons is just not enough...        10/10
588	0	a	by far one of the worst total war games i have ever tried
4993	1	a	This game is amazing, one of the best RTS games ever made. It has a very complex system, but easy to learn. I was playing as Prussia and spent 30 minutes thinking up a strategy for taking Warsaw (down to the very last detail of combat.) I then started the assault and my Line Infantry flanked both sides of the fort, while hordes of militia stormed the front. Everything was going according to plan until atleast 60 Polish horsemen, and 80 line infantry charged out the front gate at my militia. Everything went bad. Shows how the best laid plans sometimes don't go according to plan.   10/10 IGN would conquest again
4995	1	a	d00d this game be gewd
4997	1	a	On its own this game is nothing special but with mods it can be truly amazing.  The most crippling flaw in the game is the horrid blandness of the battlefields. You will never see a city in a land battle or a coastline in a naval battle.   If you can get past that though, it's a heck of a lot of fun to build a world-wide empire in the age of musket and fighting sail. As you can see by the hours I've logged on ETW, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
4999	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played. It has come a long way since first coming out, now the AI serves as a worthy opponent. 600 hours on record, speaks for itself
5001	1	a	This game is very good i love it!
5003	1	a	I have been a Total War player since stumbling across Shogun in 2001, and loved the original Rome and both Medievals.   Then came Empire ...   Although Empire: Total War was not perfect when released and has had a rough ride over the last 5-6 years, it is still the one I just keep coming back to. There's no getting away from it - the original vanilla version was flawed but after the string of patches that followed its release, it improved.   Then came the mods ...   DarthMod, for me, is still the one that makes E:TW playable over and over again. Add the AUM, personalise your regiments and play on a custom built PC with a big, full HD TV, and this is still my favourite strategy wargame despite being an old timer in computer game terms.
5005	1	a	ESRB rating was inaccurate for this game Buy it Get the DLC, Play the damn game, 10/10
5007	1	a	Really good game but way better when you play DarthMod Ultimate Commander (DMUC)!!
5009	1	a	Terrific. Installed Minor Faction's revenge mod and chose Mexico as my faction...First I spend all my funds on the resources in the nation that are undeveloped. I develop trade relations with France, England, and several others. I tax my capital heavily in order to spark a revolution to change my government, okay, so now three turns later, nearly all my resources have been developed, and a revolution has sparked up. I side with the rebels, and sweep through my capital pretty easily. The new Mexico is a republic, but no one seems to mind. I now spend all my funds on the military, building up a powerful navy and strong land force. Alright, expansion into central America and the carribbean is needed, so I declare war on spain after allying myself with England. None of my allies come to help, so it's a 1v1 with spain. I quickly board my men on my ships, and invade Cuba, sweep through, and then use my navy to knock out spain's current fleet in the Atlantic. With Spain's navy down, I can transport troops in and out as I please, and soon enough I have taken a majority of the carribbean and even Florida. Now I focus on Central America. I land a full stack of troops after waiting for 2-3 turns near Gualtmela (I can't spell it.) Where I face an army the same size as mine. My general's level is higher, and my men are experienced...I take the risk and auto-resolve it, and I win a heroic victory with only three hundred down. I invade the region capital, and suprisingly, without my garrison the populace stays content. No spainards are around, so I leave the region and invade Panama, occupying it. ALright, Spain has been booted out of the Americas...they've angered GB and are at war with them...but little did I realize the united provinces somehow JOINED Spain in their war against me, and blockaded my trade routes, cutting off my income from the Maratha Confederacy. Soon enough, they've landed a force in Cuba and blockaded my ports their with a full stack of ships...  ---------------------------------------------------------------  The game is nice and has excellent mods, but the vanilla is still good. I love just watching my men get in position as Native Americans charge at me with their axes charging while my musketmen just fire off one volley and it's like: 'Newbs, get rekt' and the natives retreat after their lines are decimated.  The only flaw is not being able to suicide ram with ships.
5011	1	a	I played as the Swedish faction I crushed Denmark became best of friends with the ottomans  and I conquered all of Russia by the year 1733  Central Europe laid bare between the pincers of my giant Swedish meat claw.   10/10
5013	1	a	Pros: I can take over France  Cons: The French won
5015	1	a	It feels a bit like an unfinished beta of Napoleon and not the highpoint of the Total War series. It's enjoyable but a bit generic due to the same reason stated before. But you can play as Sweden. 10/10
5017	1	a	This is one of the best Total war games ever! Played for 200H
5019	1	a	This is the most realistic total war game available to date. Able to utilize land armies as well as naval warfare to protect your all important trade routes. I would like to see the developers create a WWII- Total War.
5021	1	a	Great game. But all the total wars are.
5023	1	a	Its very fun and addictive and it runs really smooth. Ive had two crashes on napoleon total war and none on this.
5025	1	a	the game has a good game play and it runs fine but it constantly crashes without warning no lag nothing
5027	1	a	Played as Sweden. Came up with master plan to destroy Prussian pigs. Surrounded their borders before delaring war. Wiped them out in one turn. 69/10 would nail Prussia again.
5029	1	a	Best total war game so far hands down
5031	1	a	Well this was a game I was originally excited about. Then when i got it I had realized that it was not as fast paced as past and the now future games in this series.  Cavalry is next to useless until your line infantry gets the enemy to shaken those are my only gripes...  I do feel like the building system makes more sense than Rome total war 2 and many others but it is confusing especially for newer people and if you skip the messages detailing if a new settlement comes up good luck finding it again.  Anyways, in general a good game but all in all this is a slower paced battle game get ready for 30-50 minute battles a lot and the auto-resolve tends to say your professional units will get beat by militia in a seige battle.  Would rate this game a good old 7/10
5033	1	a	France Surrendered. 10/10 Would Realism Again.
5035	1	a	I love this game, Brilliant Graphics and sound
5037	1	a	Played as the British and destroyed/raided/blockaded every town and port in France.  10/10 would attack France again.
5039	1	a	Best of them all.
5041	1	a	BEST STRATGY GAME EVER (in the total war series. do i have to say anything else... Actually yes there is something lacking in this game and that is there is no 'victory points' like the ones used in hearts of iron so you can take over %99 of a countrys territory and you could possibly not win it automatically which is not a huge problem so it doesn't really matter.  Anyway 9/10
591	0	a	I love this game. It is one of my favorites. It now crashes a lot &amp; I can't stand playing it. I tried all the fixes that have been suggested to others to no avail.
5043	1	a	Empire: Total War is a game where you can spend tons of hours. It's very fun to play if you like strategy games. But I must warn you: you will mostly play singleplayer. If you're looking to play a campaign on multiplayer, try the latest releases of Total War.
592	0	a	Total War is one of the most popular and best strategy game series around. A series that has tackled many time periods and settings such as the Roman Empire, Medevial, and Greece. It is not suprising that they tried to bring the series to the ever popular 1700s European setting. While games such as Age of Empire 3 thrived in this era, Total War falls apart.   Pros: well there really aren't any. Any thing positive I can say for this game, other games in the series do better.   Cons: well for one, the game is HORRIBLY optimised. I can max out Total War: Shogun 2, a newer game, but even on the lowest settings this game lags... on the campaign map. That's right, this game has issues smoothly running the WORLD MAP! Admitingly, Total War's campaign maps have always been more detailed than other series, trying to make the map look somewhat like an actual overview of the real world area, but still there isn't that much going on there. This problem is even worse in combat, where even the smallest battles can slow you down. God help you if there are more than about 10 units on screen at a time. The AI is AWFUL. Not only do your opponates have no sense of self-preservation, but your own units struggle to follow even your most basic commands. Trying to get units to hide behind cover confuses them more than just about anything. Also, the whole point of Total War games is formation based combat. While this works wonderfully in the pre-gun eras, here it is painful. All you have to do is line your troops up and wait for the enemy to come to you. Thanks to the poor AI they will walk straight up to you and not even bother to flank or surround and only load their guns when they are in range of your units. This means that often times your side can get 2 volleys into them before they fire back. This basically ruins any real sense of pride in your victory because it's borderline forced apon you. You have to try if you want to lose a battle. However, things are differnet in the world map. Here, your enemies watch you, and do a good job of taking undefended bases. This is the only time the game feels like it truly is a Total War game. Unfortunatly, it is drug down by making the diplomacy system laugable at best. Does a country hate you? Don't worry, all you need to do if gift them 10000 gold or so and they'll love you! Diplomacy has always been the weakest part of Total War games, but here it doesn't even really count as diplomacy. It really feels like you're in preschool and some kid hates you so you give him a gummybear and now you're friends. It's pathetic in every sense of the word. On TOP of all this, the game is broken, with units glitching through walls, units randomly not shooting (even when they have ammo and can hit their targets), and sometimes just ignoring your commands.   TL:DL- Total War is an amazing seires, don't let this awful game trick you into thinking otherwise. Do yourself a favor and pick up Shogun 2 or Rome 1. I've tried many mods and even worked on it myself and in the end it's still a broken mess. It's not quite the Sonic '06 of strategy, but it isn't too far off from that.
5045	1	a	You need to be able to change religion.
5047	1	a	Oh, how sweet it is using canister shots against charging units and seeing their ranks get decimated in one blow. The lust for virtual blood and fake death makes me want to keep playing this game.
5049	1	a	Aweosme game. Takes a while to understand it, but when you understand everything the game becomes very addictive.
5051	1	a	Strategy time waster. Glorified RISK game with side army battles. Fun if you have a lot of time and want to manipulate everything about an economy and 1700's battle.
5053	1	a	A great game to play if your into U.S history and how the U.S gained there independece. Its really good on graphics and its online gameplay
5055	1	a	An awesome game that even shows some of history. It's a nice mix between turn based strategy and real time. I've played every Total War game so far this one was a blast to play.
5057	1	a	The is my favorite total war game, MY CHOICE NOT YOURS.    My favorite is playing as the Dutch and conquering India and the Americas!
5059	1	a	Best total war game so far. The period, the size of the map, the mods, everything is great in Empire.
5061	1	a	it is a good game 
5063	1	a	Its fun
5065	1	a	Just bought the game. I'm aware that the game was released years ago but it is still one of the best strategy games out there. Thanks for creating real strategy games with real battle strategies, real struggles and real armies. It's beautiful guys, I will buy the complete saga one game at a time.
5067	1	a	A Total War game focused on gunpowder based weaponry? Blasphemy!   So for the longest time, I held off from this game. When I finally got this game on sale, I realized how wrong I was. This game is just as amazing as every other Total War game out there and has its unique charms.   PS: This game has better ship battles than games about ship battles.  
594	0	a	Before you jump onto this game, understand that SEGA does not update this game at all. There are glitches,bugs, and crashes that are going to make you hate this game. You will play over 5 hours and when you take a break then come back to it, the saved file is unplayable. The game will just crash randomly, usually at the loading screen. This game has a lot of great features, but the total lack of updates, and support, keeps it from being playable.
5069	1	a	This is a great game
5071	1	a	absolutely addicting
5073	1	a	I love this game, I could play it all day...if I wasent in college =P
5075	1	a	It's a good game but there is a few flaws to the game.  The first flaw is how you have a huge army and the enemy or AI have 1 Brigade left, and they shoot one of your men and they run away.  The 2nd flaw is that the naval battles are 97% Rigged and seem to win 3% of my battles.   The game should include basic fifers so it makes things easier for people who don't know how to add mods.  Overall, it rates a 92/100
5077	1	a	Fun game but a little buggy
5079	1	a	Finally got around to playing this after buying it couple years ago. At first I was a little skeptical about it; not being very similar to the first Rome Total War and Medieval 2 Total War which I'm a big fan of. I'm going to say it now before giving this a good review that Rome and Medieval 2 Total War are way better compared to Empire Total War and a classic in the series. But now to give Empire T.W. a good review, this is a really good game, took me alot of getting used to compared to the older two Total War's that I admire. Still a few more things I got to learn being at 20hr's played at the time I wrote this review. Pretty addicting, more action involved in the battles, the ship battles give me a headache sometimes but are fun as well. I like the big map compared to the Rome and Medieval 2 Total War, which makes it more interesting! Overall this is a great game, like every Total War game I've played its very well optimized, and makes strategy just fun.
5081	1	a	A good expirience for total war fans 
5083	1	a	Maybe one of the total war games that failed, but i reallt thind this game should get a positive review plus if you are bored of the old empire total war. Just download darthmod. :)
5085	1	a	love the game
5087	1	a	It's a sad day for the Prussian artillery.
5089	1	a	I'm playing as France and I decided to take over Savoy (because who cares about Savoy?) after taking them over Genoa got butthurt for some reason and attacked they tried to get my friend italian States to go to war with me but they said no. Few turns later Italian states just changed their mind and attacked so there goes our 'very friendly' relations. A turn after that the Brits declared war. My relations werent great with the British but what reasons could they have to go to war? I was allied with Spain and Sweden (two very powerful and wealthy nations) and they had no help. Some interesting Ai decisions hurts the value of the game but overall I've spent hours enjoying the game and would recommend it. Battles are fun if you are a solid tactician you should be able to win even if you are outnumbered.
5091	1	a	Strong overall with a very large map and playable area, Along with a unit mixure comparable to Rome and [(hopefully) Rome II Total War]&lt;------ Even Empire makes RTW II look bad :(.
5093	1	a	E:TW is decent but needs improving. This improveing comes from Darthmod. Darthmod fixes the AI bugs a grapical issuses while leaveing the true game intact. So Vanilla or Darthmod, great game.
599	0	a	This game is a missed opportunity. It can be fun, but continually crashes with 'Application crash at empire.exe' errors. Too bad.
5095	1	a	The best game of the Total War series &lt;3 I've played hundreds of hours before I bought this game on Steam and I can say, that it's still the best strategy experience you can play &lt;3    Bazinga :p   
600	0	a	Another Total War... /yawn.
5097	1	a	its good    1,000,000,000,000,000,000/10
5099	1	a	This is my favorite Total War game!  Now I can truely dominate the World instead of a tiny island.
5101	1	a	Like strategy video games in the mount and musket era with world domination and combat in different continents such as america europe and India and more? Like strategy video games in the mount and musket era with world domination? Like strategy video games in the mount and musket era? Like strategy video games? Like video games? Like strategy? Like games? Games? Then buy this.
601	0	a	Now, while it is true I barely scratched the surface of this game (though I did play offline for around 3-4 hours) I have to say that I was expecting more. As a Welsh man, I was at the least expecting some mods or DLC to allow me to not be called England or to have more say in what gets built here - yes I know that is a little petty, but heck it'd be nice to have more options available on the 'Empire', why didn't they include every region in a massive mode that could be played in multiplayer, for example? It would have made things feel a lot grander in my opinion. That being said, the overall feel of the game was vastly different from what i'm used to in a Total War game, also. I quite enjoy M:TW and its sequel, and I enjoyed Rome Total War also. The change to cities, assassins, diplomacy, retraining troops... even the whole segmented continent maps... It all seemed a little too much like watching ants with a magnifying glass rather than being in charge.  I mean yeah, I openly admit it - i'm not that fond of the battles in these games, I would much rather auto-resolve battles after spending hours building my empire, so maybe my opinion is pointless. But hey, as an individual who likes a wide range of army strategy from Age of Empires to Lord of the Realms, Civilization to Total Annihilation, this one just wasn't as good as others in the series in my eyes. Call me dumb, i'm just being honest. I would give it a 6/10 - and for a series as big as Total War, that simply isn't good enough for me. I'm just glad I tested it during the free weekend.
5103	1	a	THEY'RE ALL DEAD!
5105	1	a	This game are for people who love war, friendship, trade and nations. become the ruler, diplomat or war lord. the things i didnt like was that there are few nations and a short period of time
5107	1	a	This game is really awesome! It derserves a sequel! I really like playing as Great Britain in the Grand Campiagn.
5109	1	a	Why ottoman empire so weak? every autoresult battle always lose?. but its ok, its recommend
602	0	a	One of the two worst Total War games ever made (along with Rome 2). AI totally broken. Buy Napoleon instead.
5111	1	a	Nothing is better than making a peace treaty with a enemy country, stocking back up on money and soldiers, and then betraying the peace treaty again when you are 10 times stronger.  10/10 would betray again.  Srsly tho seeing your front lines fire the first time and already making a enemy line flee away in terror is a great feeling. Amazing game would reccomend.
5113	1	a	Empire total war is a complete disaster. However once you add Darthmod version 8.0 it becomes not only playable but enjoyable. My only gripe is the lack of MP in darthmod which unless you have friends you will not see much of. To enable higher graphics you may also have to look up a quick tutorial on how to change the code log. Once you put some moding and enable some features the game is actualy wonderful. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MOD THIS GAME IT IS TERRIBLE VANILLA.
5115	1	a	One of my favourite games
5117	1	a	Empire Total War is an excellent addition to the Total War series. It has the right balance of turn-based strategic gameplay with macro level diplomatic, and resource management to make the game well suited for a variety of strategy game-play enthusiasts.   If you enjoyed Rome Total War, they definitely raised the bar in Empire Total War, its a must have!
5119	1	a	its very fun , the archivments are a wee bit hard to get though
5121	1	a	A truly amazing game. I would rate it around 7/10 with no mods. If you include whole game conversion mods like Darthmod it is 9/10 rating. You could go hours on end of playing this, just going through Europe, America or India.
5123	1	a	Good game. It was rather buggy, had terrible AI and diplomacy... But it was good. And I assure you it's much more better with Darth Mod. Give it a try.
5125	1	a	great game for campains and loads of mods support so 10/10
5127	1	a	Got this at the discount price, pretty solid game esp. for the price. Good to kill time with.
5129	1	a	I was going to beat this freebie for the weekend game in time for 4th of July, but after 27 or 46 hours, or however long straight I played this, it froze on me.  Oh well. It would of been a hell of an easier ride if I knew then what I know now about the game. Especially in the American 4th act.  I recommend buying it, even though I won't.
5131	1	a	play a little great game &lt;3 Total war life 
5133	1	a	A very strategic game. Is a mix between Axis and Allies and Memoir 44. I would give it an A+ because it really gets the blood flowing during battles.
5135	1	a	*This is a footage of in-Game experience (like they say in every game trailer)* 10/10 would drop the global ivory price to 1 with my trade ships again. 10/10 would fire all the minister who hadden't nice wig again. 10/10 would burn India with American Indians again. 10/10 would burn hollywood and change it to bollywood with my Indian Indians again. 10/10 would nuke Moscow with my Turkish mortars again. 10/10 would loose all my Gentleman by duels because I wanted to see those little shortcuts again. 10/10 would trade Ireland to the Ottomans for Greece again. 10/10 would fight the Dutch, American, Maratha and Protestantism revolution again. 10/10 would dump all my militia in Iceland again. (Really who the ♥♥♥♥ cares about Iceland) 10/10 would burn, ♥♥♥♥ and loot all of southern America with only 4 milita units again. 10/10 would spread Hinduism to America again. 10/10 would accept money for alliance and attack them 1 turn later again. 10/10 would want to kill Prince Eugen von Savoyen with my first cannon shot in the game again. (Austrian head general) 10/10 would Fus Roh Dah the greybeards from the Throad of the world again. Wait wrong game? 10/10 probably should go to bed now. 10/10 seriously. --------+ 160/10 ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game!     
5137	1	a	A lot of people like to say that this game is one of the Total War series failures, however I personally love this game. Yes there are many things that could be improved upon (as is true with most games) but Empire Total War was the game to introduce many new concepts into the series which have been further developed in later games. I recommend this game to any who enjoy strategy games and to all the history buffs out there. Even if you don't choose Empire, I recommend the Total War series as a whole.
5139	1	a	a great and fun game to do battles line battles and it is historic a little bit
5141	1	a	Without Darthmod it's absolutely pitiful. With darthmod it's my favourite RTS ever. Make of that what you will.
5143	1	a	Great game all around! Hours of fun gameplay! 
5145	1	a	at first i didn't play because of the complexway it works. Then i rose to the challange and played on, discovering a great combanation of Turn based and real time RTS
5147	1	a	Tactics nah i prefer brute force!  Slaughter everyone that gets in your way. But be careful before u know your capital has been conquered behind your back!  This game kept me busy for quite a while it is a bit repetitive but the feeling when you win a almost impossible battle is amazing! And that moment when u rule the world is just MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. 
5149	1	a	Fantastic game 10/10
5151	1	a	This game is quite good in combat, in some good areas of campaign and maybe a little bit of multiplayer. However I'm dissapointed in the acheivements. I play many nations in the grand campaign on easy and normal to earn the the level acheivements, however I still didn't get it. I even conqured india to earn that conquest of india acheivement and I still didn't get it. This game has screwed me over the acheivements, however if u play all the nations and still have fun with the multiplayer ur going to love it.
5153	1	a	Good game for people that like strategy games and war games. It combines adventure with strategy as you try to conquer the world while pleasing your peasents.
5155	1	a	Conquered america and my game got deleted. 10 / 10
5157	1	a	i love this game i just wihish the siege battles did not studder my game other then that it is funn as heck i love the scope of this total war and the time peroid also its just fun 9/10
5159	1	a	good games for ships to expload
5161	1	a	Played as Britain, (RULE BRITANNIA!) killed a bunch of colonials, got taken over by Iroquoi cause I went bankrupt. Indians beat the mightiest empire on earth.. 10/10 would buy again
5163	1	a	Good all around game. Huge map. Better with more powerful graphics than i have. Napoleon Total War was better even though on a smaller scale.  But most of the civilizations feel exactly the same with only some minor changes between them except Ottoman and Marathan nations.
5165	1	a	No matter what, still the classic game it will be for ever. The MODDING community has done a great job of bringin g this game up to a par un equaled in the gaming genre of RTS.
5167	1	a	This game is one of my favorite games because if you like TBS and RTS games this has it both on land and on sea and people complain 'that all the line infantry are the same model just diffrent colors' well if you look at the Ottoman empire they have diffrent models and there are some bugs like in battle and your line infantry can't hit the broad side of a barn at point blank range while at their maximum range they can gun down any unit with precicsion and such if you don't like the bugs get the Darth mod which fixes the bugs for FREE, but the detail put into this game is just amazing when your troops fire and you hit the pause selection on the timer the musket balls are really there same with the cannon shot and same with naval warfare so if you want to play a game that challenges you to be a worthy leader of a country then play this game.
5169	1	a	Rule an empire by land or sea, conquer your neighbors while turning your enemies against each other. Diplomacy and politics will run their course whilst your eyes are on the battlefield, and if you're not careful when you return to your captiol the government will have shifted. This game accurately portrays the state of affairs within a great empire, from internal disputes to armies on the campaign map to soldiers in the trenches. Keep your diplomatic officers close and your generals even closer, for once someone sets their eyes on your land, diplomacy is a concept to be scoffed at. Build your infrastructure, appease your people, and assemble your armies.   The world is waiting.   Victory and glory are within your grasp.  Your empire has gained its identity, and your people are prepared to fight for it.  The nations beyond are ready to fall...  All they need from you is a little push.  
5171	1	a	Massive battles and stunning graphics! Naval clashes couldn't be better! One of the best history-based strategy games out there.
5173	1	a	Many different nations to play as in different continents which could last you long to play this game. Escpecially if you have all the DLC's ;3.
611	0	a	Whoever made the unit skins should go to his/her closest newspaper stand, buy a modelism or history magazine and study how proper era uniforms should look like...As for the mechanics, they are broken beyond repair, making the experience a pain to play through. Buy Shogun instead...
5175	1	a	Top Game
5177	1	a	it was too hard for me but it is a great game
5179	1	a	And now the drums beat up again For all true soldier gentlemen.  Let us list and march, I say, Over the hills and far away.  Over the hills and o'er the main Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain. Queen Anne commands and we obey. Over the hills and far away.
5181	1	a	I enjoyed this game but bought it long after release when many of the bugs had been fixed. Some forts still have a fatal bottom step that will kill any soldiers that step on them (funny to see the pile at the end tho).
5183	1	a	Yes, now I can get a good grade on my history test.
5185	1	a	Good strategy game. A must have game for those who love strategy and wars I am pretty sure You will get addicted. Its give you feelings like you comanding the troops and leading them All in all must have.
5187	1	a	AI Logic - send 3 brigs and a sloop against a 3 heavy first rates...
5189	1	a	Total war empire is awesome, after i completed the campaign, i ate my girlfriends ♥♥♥ 10/10 would eat ♥♥♥ again
5191	1	a	good game try it
5193	1	a	take over the world and enforce high taxes on the populas for pure pleasure
5195	1	a	This is an amazing game. I really enjoy the historicle aspect of the game and the way you are able to control your soldiers movments. Empire: Total War has acomplished things other games in the same genre could not.  P.S. Sorry for any spelling errors I can't spell to save my life.
5197	1	a	very good I like to watch them touch each other with their big long and penetrative bayonets 111
612	0	a	Bugs... bugs everywhere,   the texts on the game is very problematic for me, They are very very hard to read. I searched the internets but no clear solution. Deal with it?  No way!
5199	1	a	So I've always been a Total War junkie. I started playing way back in the days of the first Medieval Total War, and have been playin since. Empire is starting to get a little old, but its replay value still has me coming back for me. Out of all of their series, this one is my favorite. The AI is a little predictable, but this game just offers so much.
5201	1	a	Just buy on sale, install Darthmod and enjoy. Easy to say that its more value for money that Napoleon is.
5203	1	a	This game is 6 years old and I just keep coming back to it. Great replayability and one of only a couple that have lasted this long in my library. I wish there were more like it!
5205	1	a	Has a very imperialistic feel :).
613	0	a	This is... Just play Shogun 2,
5207	1	a	Not the best Total Wars in terms of battles on land, but ship battles and campaigns in this game are amazing.
5209	1	a	Empire: Total War has been out for many years, and many other versions of the Total War series have come out since. Empire -- by far -- is my favorite of the series.  I'll start with the overview and timeline itself. The game is simply beautiful, it captures the period, and the gameplay for those familiar with other versions (Napoleon, Shogun II, Rome II) should be readily adaptable, as it runs off of the Warscape engine. So learning curve? Check.  If you're familiar with competitors (Europa Universalis, Civilization) then the game will indeed be different as a middle ground between the two in terms of complexity; more complex than Civ, less complex than EU.   In terms of actual gameplay, Empire runs the gambit between the major powers just before the War of the Spanish Succession and leading up to the Napoleonic Wars. Though mimicking Marlborough and carving a path of destruction through Europe is a difficult task to replicate here, there is enough to imitate. Each major power has its own war aims, many of which overlap others. One gets the sense of balance between the major empires -- crushing one completely invites opportunities from the neighbors: too much of a cascade, and the impulse to dominate Europe becomes a bankrupting experience... hence the chase for empire in America or India.  The battlefield experience remains fantastic, and thanks to a few good years of improving graphics drivers and the like, the average player can experience Empire: TW as it was intended by the developers. The fog of war combined with the sacking of a fortress, the annihilation of pikemen or the rapid mowing down of Turkish musketeers, the rush of Russian cossacks against Polish hussars, the power of Prussian cannon against Austrian jaegers, or the surprise of an European army coming up against a well-dragooned set of Indian infantry plus mortars? You really do get it all.  The DLCs for Empire: TW are modest and worth the purchase, as Empire was one of the first games to adapt to the DLC craze. Nowadays the DLC additions may seem fantastic and perhaps not worth the purchase, but if you're a fan of the period? They are not only completely worth the purchase, but Total War's developers do an excellent job of matching bang for buck -- if you are so inclined to purchase other TW francise works.  Downsides? Few... one can tell the difference between Empire and say, Rome II when playing the game. Later versions have improved the map, improved city governance, included more depth, etc. It is worth stressing that these are all *improvements* upon a very solid foundation. There are always rumors of Empire II, and one can tell with other TW series that such expansions can be instantly overlayed to a future run. Something spanning the Renaissance to the Napoleonic Wars? Easily done. A set that sees the Wars of Religion dissolve into the Age of Reason? Ditto there. Empire II -- should it come out (and I hope it does) has infinite promise... so when contrasting Empire: TW's downsides, one is hard pressed to see anything but potential.  In short, Empire: TW remains my favorite game in the entire Total War series, and I eagerly anticipate Empire II when the developers get around to it (after all, Medieval III and Warhammer all stand in the way). If the time period interests you, if you are a fan of other Total War games, or if you are looking for a way to introduce yourself to the series inexpensively... start here. Well worth the investment.
5211	1	a	&gt;Plays as United States. &gt;Forms NATO in 1840s with European nations. &gt;Fights Ottomans, and African powers for WMDs &gt;Russia invades the crippled Ottomans, and begins skirmishes with NATO  &gt;Tfw I accidentally begun the Cold war a hundred years earlier than intended.
5213	1	a	awsome game
614	0	a	I DDos my enemies to win sieges. Rice man I'm looking at you.
5215	1	a	My Funniest Game of This was when i played . with Darthmod combined with all nations mod as Genova And Conqured whole of europe exept Holland. then conqured half of india and then 40% of america then realized i was making 200k Per turn and dident know how to spend the money so i retired
5217	1	a	great game
5219	1	a	I like it. Even if it is still a bit buggy.
5221	1	a	In this FPS, strategy, tower defense game you kill the british with the americans. Or you can ♥♥♥♥ around in some silly billy stuff your willy mode with countries like Colombia, Peru and Hermandia you to can conquer your enemies. No but in all seriousness this game is really good.
5223	1	a	Best combination of strategy, battles and micro-management i've ever seen. Plus I just love to conquer folk.
5225	1	a	etw is a great game if u like rts games and history. There is a great variety of units and countries. however the one bad thing i have found about this game is that you units sometimes will move to get to a position in a way that makes no sense or if you want several units to turn around sometimes they will all swap spots for no reason meaning that your unit on your right flank will run across your line to reach the left flank while your unit on your left flank runs to your right.   overall i would score this game a 8/10 though.
5227	1	a	Most people say Empire was the worst total war made. I highly disagree and believe it has its potential to enjoy if you like the series. (best naval battles of any total war)  Singleplayer 8/10 Multiplayer 5/10
5229	1	a	Amazing game, Great graphics even on low, can run on ALMOST any computer, i love this game, you should download it
5231	1	a	love this game 10/10
5233	1	a	This game has lot of gameplay even without mods that can add even 1000 hours more gameplay and fun. Definetly recommended for simple gameplay mechanics and its newbie friendly game.
5235	1	a	Very fun game. It took a bit of time to get used to it but it comes easily. The demo is nice becasue is showcases and shows how well the game will run. Be sure to play a little bit of the road to independance and the the tutorial so you can get idea of how to play. 
5237	1	a	This game is fun. There's a reason I have almost 400 hours into this game.
5239	1	a	*Plays as the British *Captures Paris, the French Capitol *Rebellion happens *Crushes the rebellion *2 turns later, rebellion happens again (facepalm) *As rebellion keeps happening, I have trouble keeping up my income so I couldnt replenish troops because they keep destroying my surrounding buildings while I have other armies focusing on India and America *Loses the French capital (FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU) *5 turns later *Recaptures the capital and crushes their independence *Spain declares war on me and blockades me from sending reinforcements (more fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu) *Spain demands peace if I sell the capital to them *Gets the shotgun *Shoots the computer *RAGE QUIT
5241	1	a	In regards to general gameplay this game quite a shift in a series that tends to focus more on the melee combat of the European and Japanese middle ages. Takes a little getting used to as battles are fought rather differently on land and actual naval battles being introduced into the series for the first time. But once you get used to the changes this game is a blast to play. Watching battles unfold in this game is rather enjoy able, as you see your battle lines form up, open fire, and march through volley after volley of cannon and musket fire over piles of dead soldiers. It's also very amusing how you can get so engrossed in watching your infantry that you forget that there is still calvalry in the game until they come crashing into your flank and endanger your entire battle plan. In terms of looks and playbility I can go on all day about why this game is bloody awesome.  That said it does have some downsides. Occasionally the enemy generals will suicide charge at the start of the battle resulting in an easy win as their army's moral plummets in response. Then the enemy units will sometimes start moving non-stop randomly, running back and forth until the entire army is exhausted and has been demolished by cannon fire.(An everlasting bug in all Total War games sadly) Unlike other games of the series your generals are no longer unique. You can create them at will from another unit, and keep both, making them just another unit instead of something you worked to earn, develop and preserve; losing one of them doesn't threaten to unhinge your plans in the slightest outside of the battle they die in. You also have no real control over your government personel except for the option to sack them, really your government seems to effect the game even less than losing your generals now. Lastly, there is paid DLC that should have been in the game from the start. Other than the warpath campaign there is no excuse for this obvious cash grab.  Overall though, this is a very good game and is very fun to play. I have truly enjoyed this game and would recommend this to anyone without a second thought. And like all Total War games that it's available for I highly recommend Darthmod after you've played this game and seen what it has to offer by itself. The mod ramps up the replay value and gameplay immensely. It also helps eliminate or reduce the frequency of the few bugs I've seen in this game.
5243	1	a	You are here because Atilla and Rome 2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off
5245	1	a	this game is really fun. lots of amazing graphics, i got over 200 hours on it so it will last a long time, if you like the board game risk you will love this, turn base/rt at its best
5247	1	a	Amazing game.........when it works
615	0	a	Love the game, just so sick and tired of it crashing constantly! Locks up to the point you can't even close it with task manager! Save every turn, and then if it locks up, go back one or 2 saves, and change the way you did things, and hope it doesn't lock up again!
5249	1	a	One of the last good total war, just a bit rigged, but far less than shogun or rome 2
5251	1	a	classic total war
5253	1	a	Great game. DLCs are a little glitchy though.
5255	1	a	Confusing as hell but why the heck not?
5257	1	a	brill game amust play
5259	1	a	Amazing game, one of my personal fav's. So much detail has been put into this game. From the Animations, to the little navy men on the Boats! Crisp Graphics, that I can run on my computer!   10/10! Awesome Stradegy game!
5261	1	a	Is an intance game to play and the campaign is inspirate from real life and the online is very excite
5263	1	a	Do I like it? Sure. This is more of a criticism of the people behind the Total War Series as a whole. Why has Total War: Attila, Napoleon, Rome II got pretty much the same graphics? You don't seem to have improved your gameplay, what's more you implelemted a for profit scheme as in the newer titles like Attila we have to buy segments of the game in DLCs. So we can only play a small selection of factions, while the others remain locked because you download all the other not bought DLCs anyway, just waiting for us to buy them.
5265	1	a	Great game, likes to eat many of your hours! It is possible to win in many aspects, like just keeping your own country in europe without expanding, and going full for the trade and maintaining your fleet, or try to conquer on european soil itself. Perhaps in india? It is all possible.
5267	1	a	I've been a Total War fan ever since I picked up a copy of Medieval I (which seems like a million years ago). Empire is a very worthy addition to the Total War family - it's great fun.
5269	1	a	Great game with some technical problems.-90%
5271	1	a	Hours and hours of strategy, action and management!
5273	1	a	:)
5275	1	a	will the the game able to grow in now and in to the fucher as u move thorw the the ages it cound have alot of opion where to you could get use and mybe the hem have famil and frinds so i hope the game widen there oipitueaty
5277	1	a	The naval battles are quite fun and the commanding of the British during their heyday is awesome. I like it!
5279	1	a	Empire: Total War is a fun game challenging game, you play in three theatres of war, Europe, Americas and India.
5281	1	a	Best game ever. Still my favorite of all. I wish the Total War franchise would revisit this game and add more DLC's, maps for other continents, or better yet, a new version with the same core concept.
5283	1	a	when i downloaded this game the tittle and words glittched out and when i re-installed the game it still was glitched...can someone halp?
5285	1	a	empire total war is GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5287	1	a	1 of the best Total War Games that I have ever played. With a great skirmish mode and an infuriating campaign. Accidently got George Washington killed before the creation of the United States, but then I had a Wizard raise him from the dead, so everything is ok.   9/10
5289	1	a	8/10 would STEAMroll Europe again. The game is well-balanced, has good real-time battlefield gameplay, an immersive Grand Campaign, decent ai, and an variety of units and factions to choose from. If you like Total War games, this is a steal.
5291	1	a	why you should'int put your settings on max with a talking crappy no damn memory ♥♥♥ computer on a damn 10k USA vs 17K Native battle and putting settings on max :  *starts battle* *note pops up* (me) : Whats this *reads and say* : plz stop (me) : No (computer) : yes or i quit lyfe (me) : pfft yeah right   *smells smoke*  (me) : OH GAWD!! (computer) : bye bye to your bedroom   *computer blows up*   *buys a $ 1,000 dollor new computer*  (me) : alright... im putting everything on low.....    *hears voice and looks at burn computer*  (Burnted old computer) : I'm Back.......  (me) : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  DA END 10/10 game if you want a new computer
5293	1	a	Great game 10/10
5295	1	a	No game is 100% bug free. That being said this game is a great continuation of the Total War franchise. The ability to actually fight out naval battles, and the importance of the navy to aquire and protect trade routes was perhaps the best addition to the game for me. The added dimension of having multiple 'zones' (Europe, India, New World, +trade zones) made the game truely feel like a 'whole world' experience.  I was worried about the 'age of gunpowder' disrupting the feel of the Total War francise. I worried for nothing. If i have any reservations about gunpowder is was in the cannon units (most times i just build the most powerful of the 'old' cannons, even though they were fixed pices on the map and took longer to build).   Also, playing a different nation really changed the strategy required to win in several campains. how much navy,capture how many trade ports, how much diplomacy, abandon mele units or not? (p.s. in india a few swordsman units are a good economical value). Focus on just one 'zone' or two....or try to litterally 'take over the world'?  I poured many many hours into this game - lots of replay value.
5297	1	a	Another great game from the same team that brought Rome and Medieval II, the is vast and keeps the player invovled in the building of an empire
5299	1	a	Truly one of the best total war games I have ever played. When paired with Darthmod, that's a whole new level.
616	0	a	Nope. Can rarely get into it to play. Whatever happened to click and play. Absolute rubbish. I'll be uninstalling Steam and the Game.
617	0	a	I have sunk a lot of time into this game because I believed it was good - but just like a starving African child who glorifies a piece of moldy bread - I had no idea what I was missing.   Buy Napoleon: Total War instead, it is a much more polished version of this game. Admittedly, Empire is better if you are all about building oversea mega-nations that are constantly harried by sword-wielding savages.
5301	1	a	This was one of the best games in the series, set in one of the most interesting eras of history. It also allows me to rewrite the depressing outcome of the great northern war and make my glorious monarch the undisputed, much deserving, king of the Baltic!   Dealing with the treaty-breaking, backstabbing (as always) Danes and gain access to the bounties of Norway in the process? Check.  Stomping the small nuisance that is Poland and heeling August the Not-So-Strong? Yawn. Check.  Chasing the tsar and his large army in a hazardous drive to Moscow, culminating in a pitched battle where a pyrrhic (but strategic) victory is hard-won through sheer willpower and divine providence, thus securing the legacy of Gustavus, Torstenson, Oxenstierna and others? Check.  Oh, and there went the rest of Europe. Except the United Provinces. I like them. 
5303	1	a	A must have for all RTS Fans and those interested in the Era. Most ingenious Total War game ever  Cavalary, Infantary, Ships, Sieges and even Cannons! Empire: Total War is the best Total War Game. It is definetly at least in the top 3 RTSs I have played so far.  The presentation is pretty good with menus easily laid out. In things like battles and in a campaign, there are panels that are easy to access on stuff like government and units. The Graphics look impressive if set to max. However even, on lower settings, the game still looks pretty good. Sounds are authentic as well with muskets and cannons. In terms of gameplay, there is everything a Total War game should have and   more  . The campaign mode is defintely pretty awesome where you pick a faction and play for world domination. In the Road to Independance Campaign, you play as the United States in the events that lead to the declaration of independance. There is also a skirmish mode where you can choose a map/scenario and choose your units and battle it out. Multiplayer is also present for those who want a human challenge.  Overall GREAT and excellent replayabilty.
5305	1	a	good game if you like 18th century warfare this is for you
5307	1	a	I cant play with my friends i got the game 2 days ago but im on version 1.2 and they have had he game longer and are on version 1.5 so i cant play with them and i cant find out how to update it. Help please im playing on a macbook air
618	0	a	I really like the game but it crashes alot such as when you trasnfer troops between ships, or you go to type the amount for payment. It is really irritating when you have to redo turns over and over and over again because you didn't save yor game after every turn, one example of this is at turn 23 my game crashed and now it crashed no matter what i try and i now regret buying hte game because i have no other previous saves because the auto save was what i relied on becuase it always workewd in the past. Also, it has serious lag on the world/ continent maps, i get bettter fps in battle than with the world map, ill get on avergae 80fps on a normal battle and 17 when on the world map.  All in all dont buy the game unless you want a lot of irritation, i wish i had saved my money for a differn't game.
5309	1	a	This game is pretty fun although it does kind of get boring after awhile. The game is both a grand strategy game and RTS so you can control battles and also your nation to try to make it the best nation. The multiplayer is only battles and isn't as good as the grand campaign. Also there is a campaign called 'Road to Independence' which is about the revolutionary war in America and other wars which is cool and all but again, most time will be spent in the grand campaign. It is too bad that you can not play as other, smaller nations like Victoria 2 but it isn't really much of a problem because all the cool nations are playable. Overall, it's a good game and you should buy it if you like something like Civ V or something like it or something
5311	1	a	Traditional Total War game, I found having a navy outside of tradeships to be uneconomical.
5313	1	a	A never ending game. I got 362 hours on record and still enjoy it.
619	0	a	This game is great. But when it comes to real time battles, it's utter ♥♥♥♥. When i command my cavalry they run the other way. What the actually ♥♥♥♥? It's the same for the infantry.   ♥♥♥♥ my army.
5315	1	a	Best Campaing in total war series, although the battles and units versality could be better (There are DLCs fixing the latter).
5317	1	a	Play on very hard  gets attacked by everyone in 1 turn now owns 6 cities when you start with 2 they all rebel rebellion gets destroyed rules the world 10/10 would be prussia again
5319	1	a	I removed the P from Prussia. 
5321	1	a	10/10 Would invade Europe as USA Again.
5323	1	a	awesome game! even better with a 7.2 surround sound
5325	1	a	Want to conquer the world 18-19th century style? want to out-fab your opponents? Want to steal a galleon with small boat, then do the same with the galleon? want to have guns in melee with american-indians who just can't let you shoot them since they go kamikaze in you? ...you get the point. GET IN NOW !
5327	1	a	Vanilla: a good, but frustrating TW Darthmoded: THE BEST TW EVER. Almost 1800 hours on it, what else can i say...
621	0	a	A pretty decent game, but I would rate nearly all of the other Total War titles above Empire.
5329	1	a	This Game Awwwesome ! I Should Add to Game: -Change the state of the polity.Example:Monarchy to Republic. -You made a quick throw balls and guns. Yes Yes Yes :) But;collection to expensive ;( Please have become cheaper Thanks For GAME :)
5331	1	a	Great Game
5333	1	a	This game is bretty gud. I can shoot swedes and russians with a musket or cannon. -Finn 
5335	1	a	A really great game if you're new to grand strategy games. The game mechanics are easy to use but allow you to do rather complex things when you're in a battle e.g. skirmish formation for light infantry, diamond formation for cavalry (once you've researched it) and square formation for line infantry to fend off cavalry attacks.  The downside to this game is the campaign map. I'd like it if there were slightly more regions to conquer and the diplomacy in the campaign is primitive. For example when you're negotiating with another country their answers seem to be completely random; there seems to be no logic in their answers at all, even if I'm offering them a deal they cannot refuse.  Having said that, I think that the actual battles make up for the slightly basic campaign. I would recommend for beginners.
5337	1	a	great game.
5339	1	a	very good game, i have played 8 hours in one day &lt;3 good game really
5341	1	a	10 Reasons to download this game:   1. Sweden is a ♥♥♥♥ on it. 2. I didnt accept a trade agreement from India.... they declared war.  3. Cuba is the best investment. Go forth and conquer. 4. Pirates are ♥♥♥♥♥.  5. Ruparts Land is the Empire: Total War Version of Old Kent Road. 6. Why do Generals get old and die? (RIP 5* General)  7. The only thing worse than pirates and Sweden is Spain. Suck a ♥♥♥♥.  8. Pikemen are useless.  9. Armies loose all knowledge of tactics and training when in a fort.  10. Sea battles are for auto sim.   All comments and opinions are from my current gameplay and are no way based on true events.   But honestly Add to basket. its fun    
5343	1	a	best strategy games in 2009.i love it.but the storyline is so short
5345	1	a	Don't ♥♥♥♥ with Russia in the campaign
5347	1	a	I really enjoyed and enjoy the game! Even though i had most fun with the 'battles' I´d like to think the campaign was good too! Even though i didn´t play it very much. However i do have one question: Is it possible to play the french revolution (VIVE LA RÉVOLUTION) or is it just a advertisement for the game because it is visible in the trailer/intro cutscene?
5349	1	a	The game is good but has some AI issues. Modding is heavily recommended once you get used to playing.
5351	1	a	It's a good game; however, naval wars are boring as the game play speed during naval wars is very slow. Also, there are very low incentives to build a strong navy as docks are not included towards the region captured. Overall, I would recommend the game.
5353	1	a	Probably my favorite Total War Game. I love how big it feels and how simple it can be at times.
5355	1	a	I was testing out one of the Native American factions in a custom battle and was totes stomping and had a buncha guys left vs a british cannon unit,  but once the cannon started firing all of my Iroquois got scared by it and started routing and I lost. :(
5357	1	a	One of the best Total Wars, to bad the online community is gone
5359	1	a	Excellent game; historically correct, battles are second to none and the graphics/unit detail is outstanding.
5361	1	a	With having over 1200 recorded hours, this game is awesome is undoubtibly my most favorite game I've ever played.
5363	1	a	Recommend for Total War players.
5365	1	a	An overall great game. Too bad my micro management is ♥♥♥♥ and I can't plan attacks. Still fun.
5367	1	a	Great game what more can be said,UP THE RED COATS
5369	1	a	I have not really played much. The game is quite good though.
5371	1	a	Not the very best of the series. Had the disadvantage of being the first of the change that occured in the TW franchise. Most of the time, it felt like a beta of Napoleon Total War, a game that should be part of a larger Empire Total War and not seperate. Anyways, the new game mechanics (of that time) caused a few problems, at the beginning, for the experienced R:TW and M2:TW players (or older) but, eventually, we got used to it. I'm posting this critic right now 'cause it's sales time. So, someone might be interested in buying it. For a cheap, nice price, give it a try or have it, if you can afford it, as a cosmetic thingy in your Games-section. No matter its (many) problems, still, to this day, remains a game I'll always remember.
5373	1	a	It is great
5375	1	a	Great game!
5377	1	a	This game is for the people who like a good strategy game and time killer in certin ways.
5379	1	a	While not as in depth as some games, grabbing the Darth Mod takes this game to a whole new level!
5381	1	a	This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Period.
5383	1	a	One of my fav games. Addicting. V-E-R-Y addicting. If you people love strategy games where u get to conquer the world this is for ya. Just like every other total war game this one doesn't dissapoint aswell : )
625	0	a	All in all it is a good game, but it is not a good Total War game, in my opinion. If you think that Total Wars should be all about real time strategy, then be my guest, this is the game for you, and I would definitely recommend it. However, if like me you think that Total Wars should be less about taking an army and smashing a lot of heads, and more about taking a country and leading it to create an empire, then steer away from this game. First of all, I feel that the great improvements made to the RTS part ended up emptying the TBS part, while Total War games before this one always pursued a balance between the two aspects. Now, the campaign map is simply too easy - in particular because the other factions don't even try to really resist to your invasion, but counteract with a small-scale guerrilla in your conquered areas. It would be a great idea, if it wasn't for the fact that quite soon you get so rich you don't really care about them burning down some buildings, when you can afford to rebuild them every single turn. No matter how awful your faction is, you are going to conquer the world on the campaign map, unless you really wanna play all the battles and lose them all spectacularly (generally, even auto-resolving battles works well enough to ensure your supremacy). Then, the disappearance of the family tree - it might be more realistic and historically accurate (since when do Total War games care about that?), but suddenly your head of faction is just a name, and your generals are just a special unit you need to create an army; no traits, no marriages, no fidelity, nothing really has any influence on your gameplay. Finally, the cities - once upon a time they were living entities, which had meaningful unrest, visible growth, different needs and different buildings, peculiar to the faction, the historical period, the culture, and even the region. Now, you have five slots, with a limited choice of buildings. Trust me, you are going to build EXACTLY the same buildings, in the same order, in every city and with every faction. What's the point of having a technology tree if you only have a bunch of buildings to build?  But they gave us ship battles, that makes up for everything, right?  PS Don't be confused about my gameplay hours - I played at least three complete campaigns, but offline.
5385	1	a	Amazing game, but sometimes broken. Hit or miss, but I got lucky.
5387	1	a	one of the best games out there involving the american revolution, besides assassins creed 3. totally recomend it for everyone interested in hstory strategy based games.
5389	1	a	Quite possibly the best Total War of the recent era. A great variety in units across multiple factions and a technology tree that rewards players for their efforts. Few games can match the thrill of a regiment of artillery unloading unrelenting volleys of devastation upon enemy ranks as they close in, only to be met by waves of bullets from disiplined infantry cutting them down as they reach your lines. The Naval combat can be excillerating if not a bit difficult to master, however the graphics and combat certainly make up for it  However the game certainly has some frustrating drawbacks that seem to be a step backwards from previous games. The ability to remove your faction leader has been made tedious by having to incite revolts in your capitals. The ability to set individual taxes for certain countries has been streamlined to an overall tax slider for your whole economy. A change in difficulty simply effects how much the computer cheats rather than effecting the effeciency of the AI.  Nevertheless, the game is a solid investment and I would certainly recommend purchasing it during a sale with its few DLC unit packs.
5391	1	a	Great game! The grand campaign is extremely fun, not to mention the multiplayer and single player battles. Road to Independence is also good.
5393	1	a	&gt;Almost at the end of my Spanish campaign &gt;Empire stretches from America to Europe to Africa to India &gt;Get bored with an absolute monarchy, go for republic &gt;French and British laugh at my misfortunes as my empire crumbles &gt;French and British Kings don't like the example I've set &gt;Repel a combined Franco-British invasion (by land and sea) in the homeland &gt;French revolution takes place &gt;America declares independence and blitzes through Britain's colonies &gt;Who's laughing now?  
5395	1	a	Great game I've put in thousands of hours
626	0	a	Really feels like there's a amazing game hiding behind those unfixed bugs, terrible fighting mechanics and the campaign map. I won't write any long details, so here is my review.   PROS: -a game based in the timeline no other TW game is (it's always good to have this specialty) -music? (neutral) -attractive DLC's? -attractive in-game models? -being able to fight in the line of battle  CONS: -terrible AI -unfixed bugs -terrible fighting mechanics -regions (occupying 2 regions from france in europe will remove their entire mainland from europe)
5397	1	a	This is one of the best RTS games I've ever played
5399	1	a	Awesome game with tons of replay value :)
5401	1	a	This game is woth buying just for the skirmish mode.
5403	1	a	One of my favorite RTS games to date.
627	0	a	Not as good as Med 2 or Rome..  I wouldnt bother with it as there are so many TW games that are better than it
5405	1	a	One of the best ever created game of all times!!!
5407	1	a	The most AWESOME game EVER. It's Legen... Wait for it.... DARY, LEGENDARY
5409	1	a	balls at velocity simulator 10/10
5411	1	a	A note: I've only played singleplayer, and usually just the grand campaign.  I enjoy this game greatly, but it is not without its flaws. Unless you're an avid fan of 18th century history or feel you must own every Total War game, I would recommend holding off on purchasing this title until it's on sale.  Pros: You get to pick a nation in 1700 and do whatever you want. Yes, there are campaign objectives set for either 1750 or 1800 depending on your settings, but there's no real penalty to not completing these apart from a 'you lose' screen at the deadline. Win or lose, the game allows you to play beyond the deadline if you wish to, although line infantry and wooden sailing ships in the mid 1900s would seem a bit odd. You can try to follow your nation's historical path (like being the Russian empire and Pushing the Swedes out of Ingria), or depart from history completely (like conquering the entire Indian subcontinent as Prussia).  Cons: The AI. Its performance can be both a source of amusement and frustration. Pathfinding, for example, can be quite irritating, as you watch your grenadiers struggle with their greatest foe: the doorway. Likewise the game covers up some of the enemy AI shortcomings by giving your opponents advantages. Their general will run away the minute you select any unit to attack him (especially noticable when you attack with artillery, as his Spidey Sense goes off before the first cannonball is even fired). You must be ever watchful for friendly fire, while opponents can launch mortars into their own ranks without so much as a scratch. Seemingly poor nations weild armies that should bankrupt them, but somehow they stay afloat, and absurd trade offers are the norm (200 gold for my most valuable region? No. No, thank you). Apart from the occasional corrupted save (maybe one in every 20 campaigns), I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs.  Some other points: The game offers different government types and revolutions. Do you want to rule your empire with an iron fist as a monarch, suppressing any unrest with your military, or would you rather embrace Enlightenment ideals and side with the populace in creating a free republic? Each system has its own advantages and drawbacks, both internally and on the diplomatic stage. Combat, naturally, is one of the main focuses of the game, with real-time fighting taking place whenever two opposing armies or navies meet. You can choose to hold a line and bombard your foes with artillery, fix bayonets and scale enemy city walls, or move cavalry along a flank and charge with cold steel (and many other tactics and combinations). Researching technology unlocks more powerful units and abilities, allowing you to dominate the battlefield. Each nation speaks its native language instead of accented English, which is always a nice touch. All factions also have their own unique units, though some have more than others (looking at you, Britain). DLCs help this a little, but mods are the way to go if you really want a wide variety of regiments at your service.  Anyhow, those are my thoughts on the title. I enjoy the game a lot, but it is certainly not perfect.
5413	1	a	Playing as Great Britain(I am using the darth mod as well) thinks about what to invade sets his sites on denmark comes in and takes denmark and later norway leaving the danish on iceland  takes iceland  celebrates decides to go into america  arrives in america  deploys troops on the coast of georgia attacks georgia to help my war against the iroquosi confederacy wins georgia  descends into the carribbean starts taking the pirate owned lands  some how destroys pirates????? then takes dutch guyana(the united provinces had been destroyed) my low horrible income turns into inflation goes into india takes the previously owned dutch land ceylon  declares war on the italian states  sends troops into italy  wins it over  moves my troops back into america  bullies the cherokee taking florida and another territory in the same turn moves north takes the kaintuck territory and also tries to to take cherokee territory fails being outnumbered by 2000 with 2 substantial armies  glitches when about to take the general out suddenly like 1000 troops just appeared out of no where ends battle  rages  im still a good conquerer
5415	1	a	One of the best, if not, the best Total War game...
5417	1	a	TL;DR: This game is great! Definitely pick it up if it's on sale.  Gameplay: Empire: Total War alternates between grand strategy and RTS style gameplay, and while it certainly isn't the greatest game in either of these categories, the combination makes for a very immersive experience. The game has several difficulty settings, allowing for new players to settle in to the game, while still providing a decent challenge to experienced players, at least for the RTS portions. Navel combat was a first for the Total War franchise and it works decently. The grand strategy elements are toned down somewhat from what you might expect from a Paradox game, though this shouldn’t be a surprise.  Visuals: For a game of its age, Empire Total War looks fantastic. On release, this was actually seen as a negative, as there were concerns that the minimum requirements for the game would make it inaccessible to many fans of the series. However, in 2015, the excellent quality of the visuals makes this game timeless.  Story: The setting of Empire Total war is what makes this game my favorite Total War title. It’s set between the 100 year period from 1700 through 1799. The story mode itself isn’t anything special, but rarely do you play a grand strategy game for a linear storyline. In most of the campaign modes, the outcome of the game is mostly up to you. Do you want to become a great trading nation, or is world domination more your style?  Sound: For the most part, the battles sound great. The overworld also features decent sound, but overall there’s nothing here to write home about.  Music: The music in the overworld doesn’t change much, but doesn’t usually get annoying. If it does, the plus is that you can mute it and very little is lost. The music during battle sequences is fitting, but nothing I would add to a playlist.  Overall Assessment: Empire: Total War may lack the depth of a Paradox title, and may not be the greatest and most innovative RTS in existence, but what it sets out to do, it does well. The game is generally priced higher for an older title, but if you see this one on sale, it’s definitely worth your time.
5419	1	a	so diappointed 174 turns 47 hrs in on United provinces and the game wont quit crashing,,,, all it keeps asking is do i want a refund... no I want my game to work...
631	0	a	not worth it
5421	1	a	This game, personal best total war game ever i just olve the diplomacy factor and that you must allso know how to manage and maintain your empire once you are able to expand, if you are looking for the most detailed game of the total war series this one is it as you must not only master land and sea battles you must now worry about religion, technology, diplomacy, piracy, and somany other factors taht added up together make a great game
5423	1	a	I put some 2000 hours on this awesome game. It has plenty of features and the hours of fun. You should like the historical battles and real opponents.
5425	1	a	Love this game can't wait for the next
5427	1	a	The best TW game in my opinion. Why? - Awesome Naval combat - Global scale - My favourite period in history - Sikh Infantry rocks! - Nothing better than the sound and smoke of a 1000 muskets dropping the enemy's entire front line in 5 secs
5429	1	a	This game is by no means as good as rome 1 or medieval 2 but overall when weighed against rome 2 its not bad.And I personally dont think it derserves as much ♥♥♥♥ people give it dam sure deserves some.Overall 6/10 as it is now for twenty dollars.
5431	1	a	This game is awesome. But note, you need to have a good operating system in order to play this game smoothly. I have a DUAL Core Processor with an ASUS HD Series video card, and my game is lagging like hell. But even then i cal play it on the lowest graphics available. Totally worth the money if you ask me though!
5433	1	a	Still and forever will be my favourite Total War game...
5435	1	a	Truely epic.
5437	1	a	Unpopular opinion: Best Total War part so far. A pity, that there's no multiplayer campaign, but the gameplay is great though!
5439	1	a	ITs not new but fun, better then rome 2, where did they go wrong?
632	0	a	CA no longer supports this game, they never fixed what was broken before they stopped supporting this game. do not buy this game.
5441	1	a	one of the best i think!
5443	1	a	awsome strategy game. would recommend.
5445	1	a	One of the best games ever made in the total war genre!
633	0	a	Very good game overall, amazingly fun gameplay. I would rate 10/10 BUT since the company didn't finish the game properly and wont do anything about the campaign bug i'd rate it 3/10. Because when you're in to turn 150 you don't want to lose all of your savings.

634	0	a	Steam Sucks real bad avoid it if you can. The games you buy will constantly stop working. I wishh they would leave my game alone!!!!
5451	1	a	I find Empire Total War to be one of the best games in the series. The reason for this is the huge world, the many factions, and the immense tech tree. No other Total War game rewards you for advancing your tech tree as Empire Total War does. It just feels amazing going from single firing muskets to gatling guns and missiles.
5453	1	a	
5455	1	a	Best Total War game to date!
5457	1	a	I am obsessed with this game. This is by far-- in my estimation -- the best of the Total War Games.   Some of the battles can be a bit quirky, but other than that, pure gold. Highly recommended.
5459	1	a	brilliant game, although that may be because of my love for those times. i like that you have to research tech to advance from standard gameplay to a truely powerful nation and end up ruling the world.
5461	1	a	Great RTS game that, while not as good as Napoleon, is very superb in it's objectives.
5463	1	a	This is the best game ever best total war ever! I totally recommend it if you are looking for a strategy game to play with a friend the DLC units help alot but are not required to play I win with just militia sometimes. YES IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET IT IF YOUR AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5465	1	a	very fun for any stratagy fan who likes a challenge
5467	1	a	I was always scepticle about guns in total war, which napoleon total war backed up in its personally dissappointing gameplay/battles. However, thought id give empire a go and it has turned out to be one of (if not the best) total war of the series. This coming from someone who enjoys watching sword and spear clash in usual titles. Blown away by the graphics and depth the developers have gone (in terms of the map and locations) added with the usually great (minus napoleon) battle engine. Great Title, recommend anyone scepticle of Guns/line battles/general era (1700+) in total war to give this a try! you wont be dissapointed!
5469	1	a	carl is an awesome llama
5471	1	a	This game is great in vanilla but absolutely brilliant with mods. I'm using the Minor Factions Revenge mod and it just makes an already great game 10 times better! Of course, this game does have a few bugs here and there that can be infuriating at times, such as units getting stuck on walls in seiges, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.   The revolution mechanic is very ambitious and I love the changes to flags. The campaign drawback is that regions such as France and Spain are not split up enough, and taking the capital (which is easy enough anyway) is all you need to do to capture it. They don't even have Wales or Northern Ireland as regions, which means destroying Britain is as simple as taking those three regions early on in the game. It annoys me that these 3 major nations can be so easily destroyed so early. The multiplayer connections are also very dodgy and you will need a Hamachi network with your friends if you want to play with them.  But besides those few negatives I really enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Total War games. 9/10
5473	1	a	Imperialist's wet dream
635	0	a	I have got Napoleon...       AND BOY IS IT WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY BETTER!
5475	1	a	love the game are u guys fix it so i can play it one window 7 thats would be great
5477	1	a	• Starts as Sweeden • Russia, Denmark, Great Britain, Prussia, destroyed by 1766 •Invents Volvo, IKEA , and Zltan Ibrahimović • everyone tries to invent Zlatan • Me: Fools the is only one Zlatan  R8 421/2 M8. G8 Game
5479	1	a	It is a nice game, but Napoleon is, as far as I see, better.
5481	1	a	This is the best game to entre the world of Total War. Plenty of skill levels and Nations to play. A game with depth that can be played solo or online agaianst many. Addictive to a fault, I highly recommend this game.
5483	1	a	A review for a game of this quality can be short and sweet. This is a thoroughly playable and enjoyable game (even in 2016). Three quick tips are... 1 - turn your phone off 2 - save your game regularly  3 - immerse yourself
5485	1	a	one of the best strategy games I ever played.
5487	1	a	Great dynamic and diverse strategy game. Like tactics, hundreds/thousands of units and epic battles? Then play this game!
5489	1	a	this is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5491	1	a	
5493	1	a	Great game.
5495	1	a	A promising concept that's hamstrung in a numerous ways; oversimplified campaign map that makes conquering countries a child's affair; americo-centric design principles concentrate an uneven amount of attention for what amounts to a tiny period in the whole affair, a case of the DLC's and of course, the last hundred years cut off to serve up as a semi-sequel a few months later.  To play Devil's advocate, the naval combat is excellent, land battles are believable and enjoyable, research and population are managed better than previous titles and the overall feel is less clunky than its predecessors.   The AI remains a schizophrenic insane diplomat in the strategic map, and goes from Napoleon's protege to lobotomised monkey depending on the alignment of the planets, and often carelessly runs its cavalry into stakes or gun lines.  Definitely worth a look, but it disappoints mostly in the prospect of what it could have been with less interference from SEGA.
5497	1	a	amazing game, i recommend it to anyone looking for a good gaming experience. very good war game.
5499	1	a	I enjoyed the game quite a bit. If you wanted to lead the United States through the Revolutionary war you can or just become the first world leader, your choice. 8/10
5501	1	a	9/10 Great classic strategy game. choose to play as any developed nation during the 1700s. inteface fairly simple. take command of single battles and turn the tide with superior strategy+ manage your economy, tech research and diplomatic relations with other countries+ conquer and rule the world+ mwahahaha:)  very disapointed it doesnt have workshop or updates game sometimes feels like pre release and napoleon should of been dlc expansion. they dlc vvhore and move on to pump out the next one
5503	1	a	One of the best strategy games ever! The maps and the playability is out paralel, much action but mainly lots of thinking and lots of things to do in the campaign ap cenario. Worth it so much!
5505	1	a	Fantastic and unique game in the Total War franchise, a must buy for any Total War fan.
5507	1	a	low audio
5509	1	a	This is a well crafted fun militaristic game. I like how the units will fire in neat and organized volleys instead of firing at their own pace. The only downside I could see to this game is that practically all the nations have the exact same units with the exact same uniforms but in different colored uniforms. All in all, I highly suggest this.
5511	1	a	10/10
5513	1	a	ETW Is one of those games that still holds up to this day. Although it is 7 years old, And the developers dont pay any attention to it anymore, It still has a strong loyal community that will always keep it going. I myself have been playing ETW for 2 years now and I think it is still a pretty fun and casual game to play.
5515	1	a	One of my favourite Total War titles, it's just a shame they haven't enabed workshop for it. 
5517	1	a	one of the best but some tech issues.
5519	1	a	play this legendary game if you dont have it. its only $14.99
5521	1	a	TL;DR: If you are a fan of this era in history, then you will enjoy the game. If you are looking for a matchlock style game, try Shogun 2 FOTS. I honestly think Shogun 2 just did it better.  OK. I honestly wanted to give this game a downvote because Shogun 2 FOTS is superior on a technical level. The AI is better, the unit diversity is better. Does this mean Emipre is a bad game? No. But, if you're looking for the Total War game with guns, then I highly recommend Shogun 2 FOTS over Emipre. You can usually find both on sale and shogun 2 is like 7.50 while Empire is 4.50. So for the extra 3 bucks you're getting a much more modern game.  Again - if you are a fan of this time period then give it a try as you will most likely like it. But if you're looking for the TTW game with rifles, I honestly think that Shogun 2 FOTS is a more modern, more refined, and more flushed out game that's going to give you a better experience.  Empire : Great attempt. Shogun 2 FOtS: took what empire did right, made it better, and made a fantastic fantastic game.
5523	1	a	It's Alright. That's almost all i can say about Empire Total War. Not a Rome 2 level trash-fest but, at the same time, it aint' no Rome: Total War. Reasons? The Good: -Damn fine historical accuracy MOSTLY. -battles controls feel simpler, more realistic. -SEA BATTLES. Wow. Nuff' said. -Campaign is solid and won't muck around with boring AI and long, drawn out turntimes like in other Total War installments.  The Bad and the Ugly: -Graphics suffer from the same hazy, crayola-looking dreariness that Napoleon after it suffered with. -Again, why are the unit funds in custom battles restricted to a ten year old's pocket money? -AI is borderline slow. And i mean it this time. I get that this game came out years ago and that there is areason why it sold for less than a fiver on Steam, but come on guys, if Rome:Total War ihas better AI than a game made years after it, something's wrong. -Units feel repetitive, the images for some units are literally just repasted with different colours. -AGAIN, Why is the unit fund so low? whyyyy??? If it's on sale, meh, give it a go. Maybe you'll love it. 6/10    'It's like playing with warm dough. Slow, messy, but at least it's not crap.'
5525	1	a	thats so cool game ever i have scene
5527	1	a	the game is pretty good but it crashes way to much
5529	1	a	GR8 love all the total war games but this is a hole new monster compared to rome
5531	1	a	The only things that I dislike about this game is that the diplomacy can be ridiculous sometimes and siege battles feel clunky/buggy/crappy in general. Diplomatic threats don't really seem to do anything, even if you have conquered all but one of an enemy faction's regions in a blitzkrieg-like fashion. The AI in battle will sometimes make you do a Picard double-facepalm, but that hasn't happened too often for me.   Controls were alright. You can play as minor nations but you'll need darthmod to do that. Otherwise, I've liked the game a lot. Hoping to get Shogun 2 soon. I haven't played multiplayer yet, and I've had a fair amount of hours just from the single player Grand Campaign (along with the Road to Independence campaign).
5533	1	a	Genocide the french: the video game
5535	1	a	The best and most addicting Total War game. This series was made for the era of Empires.
5537	1	a	Loved it! 10 out of 10! The City Management is different than prevous total war games and takes time to get used too. But over all AWESOME!
5539	1	a	Started off as The U.S. at first we was thought of as poor Colonies then bam i own the whole freakin world! (Except Russia you cant take that giant snow globe)
5541	1	a	I love the game but recentley ive been having trouble get into the game and I have no clue on what to do i tried deleting the game and reinstalling it but nothing has worked.
5543	1	a	Please fix the graphic optimization CA, this is one of the best Total War's to date!
5545	1	a	This game was AWFUL on release. And I do mean AWFUL. Buggy as all hell, confused as to what it wanted to be, buggy, bland music, did I mention it had a TON of bugs?  Having said that, time, and mods, have been kind to this title.  Patches mostly fixed the nightmarish buggy mess that was, and made a platform that is relatively stable. Yes, I say relatively because you will still find the occasional hangup or outright crash.  Modding is what elevates this game to something that deserves playing even today. So many mods, of very high quality, that turn this into a very enjoyable experience.  Wait for a 75% discount and buy it.
5547	1	a	Great game
5549	1	a	I love this game :)
5551	1	a	The game is definitely worth checking out. I really like various historicaly based detailes poping up during gameplay, which are also nation specific. Great touch. Battle rules are a little different than other total war games, mostly due to firearms usage.  Empire has different way to use regions. Beside the capital city there are towns which develop over time and can be used to increase happiness in region, income, convert to different religion, or build research facility. Those towns can be raided and damaged.  Cons: Very limited usefullnes of agents. there are 3 types of agents and each has 1 or 2 actions which you might find usefull. It could have been more developed. Diplomacy options are very limited from my point of view, and I have not noticed any specific value in terms of victory conditions (allies, portectorate). Battle placements. Chosing a place of the battle on campaign map has little value as the area is poorly reflected on battle map. I think it is a breat loss. Additional battle fortifications are rarely ever available and sometimes have weird consequences eg. artilery after fortifying cannot be moved and even change of angle is very limited. It certainly does not look like it should. I have also missed Total war encyclopedia which would be very useful.  Overall I think the time period the game is set in is quite interesting and game is fun. Some things can be changed and improved by mods, which are missing on steam but do not doubt those are available.
5553	1	a	Not as good as the old ones but still good.
5555	1	a	Cool
5557	1	a	it is not the best ther is but it is a good game
5559	1	a	One of my favourite Total War games. The setting fits well with TW gameplay.
5561	1	a	Best campaign map, worst battles
5563	1	a	The one of the best addictions that u can find on steam
5565	1	a	  Best history manual.
5567	1	a	The best Total War game and one of the best RTS games out there.
5569	1	a	This game does stand the test of time. I find myself always playing it when nothing else feels fun.
5571	1	a	This was my favourite total war game so far. not played warhammer TW yet though. I liked having all the different buildings in your regions, so not so keen on the dumbing down ive noticed in the newer games. Also the time period was a great setting for this kind of game. all in all loved the game. they got soooo much right here its easier to just say what went wrong. Mainly the downside of this game is all about the AI.  In campaign the AI can be a bit dumb. make some very strange choices, and the diplomacy is just crazy. ' yea i declared war on you and sent massive army that you wiped out. but if you give us some of your regions from your victory conditions we will make peace with you. how about it?'....um let me think.....no, i dont think i will.... not this turn. or next turn. or every turn till i wipe you off the game.  In combat the AI can actually be ok. unless its a siege. if defending the AI can be easily outwitted. and enemy troops can be moved away from key areas too easily with units which are no threat to a fort. and once you breach the walls even the most top end pc is going to be down to time passing at half speed as the AI tries to figure out what to do with certain troops.  In Naval battles the AI can also be a bit skewed. i've yet to find a fleet i couldn't destroy or seriously damage with 1 Brig. Get close and fire at the closest riggings ships while running away. your generally faster to start with and once thier sails are gone you can go in for the kill. the AI just cant del with this.  But i loved pretty much everything else about the game. so can highly recomend.
5573	1	a	- play as sweden - i want polen :( - declare war to poland in turn 2 - got my ♥♥♥ kicked by denmark/norway/saxony/courland/russia by turn 5 - last stand at stockholm - epic last stand for 2 hours - worth it 10/10 would take polen again
5575	1	a	When the game came out it had huge ambitions, unfortunately it could not live up to them. The game is still ridden with bugs, although not game breaking. When you love the time period, when you love creating massive Colonial Empires spanning over the entire world, than this game is definitely for you!!! The sheer size of the campaign map, spanning 3 continets is something unseen even to this day. The land battles can somtimes be too easy for seasoned players but there are MODS that fix that. The naval battles are fenomenal, especially when you like the time period. From the Indian ocean up in to the Caribbean you gonna fight massive ship battles to establish control over the important trade routes that supply your empire with the with the most needed gold and wealth to crush your opponents.
5577	1	a	While the Total War franchise as a whole is quite excellent, Empire: Total War remains my favorite of the series. It does an excellent job of representing the era it was placed in, there are no commanders necessary to raise armies as is required in the newer Total War games, and I prefered the region management system more, with individually upgrading farms and towns instead of having only so many slots per region for buildings. The AI isn't the brightest, but the gameplay is very different every run-through and it is very rewarding to take a small empire like the United Provinces and conquer the entire conquerable world.
5579	1	a	My favorite Total War™ game so far; the gameplay is amazing and there are some awesome mods made by the community to try out.
5581	1	a	Best yet RTS game ever. Well played for the creators. First time played when I was 12yrs. That time I played in cyber cafe lol.   Highly recommended this game if you're into strategic domination game with empire management (trades, technologies, armies and much more) and battle against enemies with thousands of your armies. Damn nice.   For me, Empire: Total War is much better than any other Total War games. The reason why I picked this as the top of Total War is because the management is much easier to understand, the map is huge as shown from America to India. Then, fleet battle is damn cool and the siege too. Also, balanced the diplomatic of agreement. So yea.   I prefer this game than any other Total War games evendoe I do played Medieval II, Rome II and Shogun II last time.
5583	1	a	it very entertaining
5585	1	a	Awesome game! Play it!
5587	1	a	still holds up great graphically and gameplay wise. now is actually the best time to play it with a modern i7 and decent sized SSD. it struggled lots on older hardware and crash, especially as your empire grew. now you can take over the whole world and it's fine.
5589	1	a	a very in depth game for ppl with brains and patience...and a lot of time lol!
5591	1	a	Very Realistic, but Darth Mod is a Mod that makes the game Look better in UI and just everything Basicly
5593	1	a	10/10 Excellent game. Great features with city development and naval battles, even if not always perfect
5595	1	a	I've spent countless hours conquering the world with this game, I recommend it to anybody who loves strategy games or the time period it is set in (18th Century) I also recommend using the mod DarthMod Ultimate Commander, which improves many aspects of the game.  Updating for the steam awards. Still enjoying the game!
5597	1	a	Great game, have been an fan of all previous total war titles and this is just as good. Have spent enough hours playing now so have a good feel for the game and i can recommend it 100% if you enjoy RTS games. Only negative for me is the lack of playable factions, there are many in the game but only a few are available for the campaign unfortunately, of course this problem can be addressed with mods to allow you to play as all of these factions, and adds many more.  On the whole i would give this game 8.5/10 and highly recommend it for veteran or new players. 
5599	1	a	This game is fantastic and this is my very first time playing a grand stategy game! I love the campaigns. You actually get involved in the characters lives and you feel like a wonderful leader of an even more powerful army. This game has truly surprised me.
5601	1	a	I recommend this game and grade it an 8/10.  The Grand Campaign is immersive, challenging and entertaining - the mix of Grand Strategy and RTS makes for the most interesting game experiences. The period in which Empire: TW takes place n makes it easy to learn and hard to master, any move can be countered and turned against you - and with mental hospital patients who think they're tree's as national leaders - you have challenges not with the RTS battles just in multiplayer but in campaign as well. The AI is a bit daft.  The Road To Independence campaign was wonderful, however I wish (if it's possible let me know) you could play as the British (George III) not the British Revolutionaries (George W.) or as a native tribe (I know about Empire: Total Factions, does it affect this campaign?).
5603	1	a	My favorite of the series.
5605	1	a	This game should have gotten more love from the developer before initial release, but overall it is quite good and with modders around it's bound to get better.
5607	1	a	Classic Game filled with awesome battles
5609	1	a	The mighty Maratha Confederacy stretches from India to Britain to Canada, built upon the corpses of thousands of Bargir line infantrymen, dead cuz the AI's dumb but so am I. I just send them into meatgrinder bayonette fights while I sit on an elephant 500 yards behind the carnage and listening to the Podquisition applauding my own tactical genius!
5611	1	a	one of the best games ever!!!!!!!!!!!
5613	1	a	I love the Total War franchise though I must admit that this game does it really well, there are a few bugs still relevant even in this age but nothing too bad, there are mods littered across the internet that improve and enhance gameplay. I love the divesity in factions and the different play styles as you work your way through, able to change your government and take yourself either into the greatest war ever or turtle up becomming a trade empire before buying off all your enemies. Would highly recommend this game if you've never tried it before though if you want a total war to get into, it would be a toss up between this and medieval 2.
5615	1	a	Great history game with to much things to do.
5617	1	a	Empire is my all-time Total War favorite after the CA fixed the early bugs. The game is mostly well-balanced, the firearms bring an extra dimension (tactical combat phase isn't just mindless melee) and the three theatres (Europe, India, Americas) provide varied approaches to the Grand Strategy. Exchanging broadsides in naval combat is also very well done.  18th century is well represented and the different units (line and light infantry, light and heavy cavalry, dragoons, cannons, howitzers etc.) are interesting. You can play as a historical European superpower like France, Prussia, Austria, Sweden or Poland-Lithuania or choose the Ottoman Empire or the India-based Marathas. The United States has her own campaign, as well as the Native Americans. Regarding the learning curve for new players, this isn't a walk in the park but not a minute-detail micromanagement hell either.  Only serious downsides are that the AI and unit pathfinding are at times bit lacking but otherwise this is a very engaging and entertaining game. Highly recommended.  I nominated this game for the 'Office Chair General Award' in 2016 Steam Awards as it is in my opinion the most satisfying world conquest game ever for us basement napoleons/caesars.
5619	1	a	The best in the Total War Series, Great replayability.
5621	1	a	the mods keep this game alive and it is good 
5623	1	a	This was the first Total War game that I ever played, and this was my first Steam and PC/Strategy game I've ever played. This is by far along side Shogun 2 and Medieval 2, my personal and most favorite game ever! I've been playing this since 2014 and I've never stopped playing it since, sure I only put in 711 hours into it, but that's because I played others so I don't end up burning out of this game. Yes there is problems with the game (What total war doesn't?) The Naval Combat isn't the best, AI combat or diplomacy is an issue or acts dumb or wired. But I've had far more better experience playing, fighting, expanding, and a bit of roleplay in my mind. If your planning on getting this, or hesitant on buying it. Trust me, you'll have a blast playing this, especially with mods makes this even more better and additive. If your planning on getting this or Napoleon, get Empire first, more nation's, more areas to conquer, and much more units to choose out of. Sure the alot of units are the same and fight the same except a decent handful depending on the nation you play as. But you'll end up playing so much and lose track of time as you March an army of 3000 vs an army of 4000 and watch as your men and enemy slaughter each other in a tense or losing battle making think on which tactic fits you best and watch as your favorite Line Infantry, and renaming it too, and watch them either cut down the toughest of battles, or watch them rout and being cut down. You'll have fun, I'll guarantee it! And the mods for this is just perfect if you're looking to expand on the experince.
5625	1	a	Easily one of the best Total War games to date. It has replayablility, in depth turn-based grand strategy, and tactical real time battles that have the sight, feel, and sound of the Age of Colonialism.  Although it came out awhile ago, its graphics are not terrible by any means, and as you can see from my own play time: It's a favorite.  I also nominated this game for the 'Game within aa Game' award, because it really does feel like two different games. One momment your in the cannon smoke filled fields being a Genearl and master tactician of troops, and in another you are a King: Whose will is absolute and you have a wide range of abilities that factor your economy, your peoples opinion of you, espionage, research, infastructure, and of course building and maintaining an army (Their expensive by the way)  Only downside is that Sea warfare is kinda tricky, but the graphics and simiulations of boarding another's ship and claiming her for your own is very satisfying. ;)   Defs buy this game if on sale and if its not buy it anyways, especially if you appreciate the Total War franchise.
5627	1	a	Great game, great for all you stratagy gamers!
5629	1	a	Im going to be clear: This is NOT my favorite Total War game. Medievil 2 has that title. Anyway, so if you didn't buy this at release or close to release like me your in luck because at launch this game was a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. Crashes left and right, units falling through the world, complete lag on the campagin map. Luckly it did get Ironed out and now its only an okay game. Diplomacy is completly useless. I offered the Ottoman Empire 100000 gold,Venice, and Canaster Shot for Egypt and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s counterofferd for me Iceland for 1000 gold. What the acutal ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, you will have fun with the battles unless you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by a city-state like I did my second playthrough as Sweeden. The only reason I recommend this is because its Total War. And I have had some enjoyment of it. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being I'd rather go jack of an elephant than play this game and 10 being I love this game more than Skyrim, Porn, and Kate Upton combined, and 5 being buy it when its on sale, I'd give it a 7.
5631	1	a	This was the first game I ever purchased on Steam and it has been my favorite ever since!!!!!
5633	1	a	Amazing game with loads of replayability...if only destroying walls in forts against the ai didn't cause so much lag.
5635	1	a	It's a Total War game. Best will in the world it's more of the same: units and strategic maps may change but the basic controls and overall experience don't. If you have never played a Total War game but you love both real time and turn based strategy then buy this game now (or one of it's siblings), you have no idea what you've been missing all these years. If you have played a Total War game before then you know exactly what you're getting.
5637	1	a	Great game for the series. In my opinion, the firearms makes for a more fun battle experience as compared to others in the series. (Shogun, Rome)
5639	1	a	i would say this is by far the best game in the series
5641	1	a	Empire had a real bad start. I remember it was heavy for even a highend machine. But if you want to enjoy the maximum graphic from such a game you need a really modern machine. For the rest it's fun especially if you play England as you really enbarc on the colonial adventure both on east cost of America to crush the rebels and aquire power in India. I strongly recommend the game with all its DLCs
5643	1	a	I jost love this game, one of the best from Total War series
5645	1	a	MERICA! ♥♥♥♥ YEA! Coming to save the mother ♥♥♥♥ing day YEA! England your plans are through, because now you have to answer too, AMERICA! !♥♥♥♥ YEAH! Killing Injins is the only way YEA!
5647	1	a	Extremely good game, in every aspect. Multiplayer is amazing, especially with friends. The grand campaign is also extremely fun, as it is in any total war game. Overall great game and you all should pick it up. 5/5
5649	1	a	Great game, love it! Seriously it's great!
5651	1	a	This for those who are intro making their history. Also GUNS!
5653	1	a	Such a wonderful game, I would really have to look for something bad to say.
5655	1	a	Excellent game. It's like RISK on steroids. It's turn based, and is very reminiscent of games like Civilization, but the combat system is awesome, and the battles are epic. It's quite fun to see your army of 1500+ units on the field stoming a fort. The naval battles are pretty epic as well, and they do them quite well. If you are a fan of turn based strategy games, with some real time elements, I highly recommend this series. 
5657	1	a	With Civ 5 very much on the build and expand side of an imaginary scale, Empire: Total War really goes the other direction. It does have building, but you will know that it's just tedious chores with the appearance of building an empire, when you really just want to put on your Generel's cap. So Empire: Total War really goes to the other side of the specturm, towards the conquer and combat side. It may enchant you, it might also just bore you to death.
5659	1	a	Epic real-time stratagy game! The faith of your empire is in your hands!
5661	1	a	This is easily the best RTS I have ever played. The depth of campaign strategy is easy to learn, but challenging at the same time. Battles are tactically pleasing to perform and rewarding when a major victory occurs. My only complaint is that in naval battles, the ships often sail in a very clunky fasion and sometimes sail strange routes when engaging. Other than that, this is a very engaging and rewarding game in the long run, and I cannot stress how much Empire belongs in the RTS lover's library 4.5/5
5663	1	a	Empire Total was is simply the best, and only game of its genre that offers this kind of entertainment, strategy, city building and enjoyment. I have put over 360 hours into this game, and I thoroughly recommend it. An epic piece for fans of the 18th centrury warfare, naval battles, diplomacy, and city building/economics. The premise is quite basic, guide your empire in conquering the world! Modify your cities, manage your armies, use strategy to defeat your opponents. Forge alliances and press forward as your nation becomes more prestigious! A must own, must play!
5665	1	a	Possibly the best Total War game i have ever played, it's great being able to march regiments against natives and frenchmen alike. I much enjoyed this game. It is far more user friendly than it's predecessors such as Medieval II as it is easier to keep your economy in the positive. It also is the biggest scale.
5667	1	a	One of my favorite themes in the Total War series. The naval combat is superb and almost always play them out other than 'auto-combat.' This is definitely worth the money if you are into 18th Century combat and the Total War series.
5669	1	a	Empire total war was the first total war game I ever played and (for me atleast) has never bugged out in all the time i've played it. the game map is much larger than Napoleon total war with America, Europe and India all in one game, this means that there is ALOT and I don't mean a dozen or so I MEAN ALOT of factions most unplayable but keeps the game going on for a long time (you will need the space bar).   in the game each region has villages or towns that will grow over time and these can be turned into reaserch, religion or industrial towns that can help you reaserch multiple technologies (my favorite), spread your religion or gain more money.  naval and land battles are fun, cannons play less of a role in land battles than in FOTS since you need to reserch different cannon balls for your guns to get explosive or incindiary. And if you want a new army but don't have a general you can just recruit one on the spot. The ability to build forts can help defend a narrow area that might lead straight to your defensless city.  the interface is difficult to get used to if you have played shogun 2 most of the time since text is small, borders are not very clear and the white triangle on the mini-map is hard to see through. I would reccomend getting a text enlarger for the game.  In terms of mods ETW doesn't have steam workshop but i haven't looked around for mods either. Napoleon total war has a WW1 mod for it but is much smaller with only Europe in the game and suffers from some of the problems above.  overall I would reccomend ETW to someone who wants a large game set in the American independance war era. If you have Napoleon total war and don't want to go bigger get shogun 2 or FOTS
5671	1	a	THIS GAME IS ASWOME
5673	1	a	This is Awesome!
5675	1	a	I'm a big fan of the total War serias and so when I heard about the Empire installment I was thrilled and bought it for 50 bucks. Now although it's still a very good game. I felt that it took a lot of qualities that I liked about the earlier games and threw them out but also put some new qualities in that I liked. It was just a different game. I would still tell you guys to buy it though! Just the sea battles are enormously fun and sending 30 small ships to take one huge 1st ship of the lane is hilarious.
5677	1	a	Colonial atrocities, fun for all the family! ♥♥♥♥ing oohrah
5679	1	a	After a long day of school or work, what's better than beating up on some Redcoats? Take the Americas, Africa, Europe...the World! for any major power of the 18th and 19th Century. Large-scale strategy is unmatched by any other game than the Total War series. If you're a history buff or enjoy military tactic like me, you will enjoy this game immensely!
5681	1	a	A great game, I really enjoy playing it!
5683	1	a	this game is really good the sea battles are brill. the land battles are good (can be a bit slow)but altogether a very good game good for the price and very beautiful. 9/10
638	0	a	Could have been a good game, it is was without all its bugs, still not resolver in 2014!!!! Some sieges make even the best computer lag like hell; saves can become corrupt (cool your whole game is lost!)... And also ennemies who don't attack in a siege... Elite units packs are a pure waste of money.
5685	1	a	awsome game, keep coming back to it time and time again
5687	1	a	Fabulous game. The graphics are brilliant, and run well, even on the higher settings, i love the battles, and the view of each battle. The strategy world map is brilliantly layed out, its easy to see, and the countries are clearly separated. There are many different tactics and gadgets availiable for deployment, which means there are many different ways to win the game.  When i bought this i was new to total war, and it took some getting use too. It is a deep game, especially the grand campaigns, however, it is well worth it.  The only thing i dislike is the naval battles. They are difficult to control, very boring, yet somewhat unavoidable, however hard you try.
5689	1	a	easily the best total war game i have played! i really hope they make another one like this!
5691	1	a	All of the total war games are awesome!
5693	1	a	£20.00? I didnt know they stacked ♥♥♥♥ that high. All kidding aside though, empire total war is a great departure from the hack-n'-slash swords and sandals action of all previous installments, with a new (hindering) engine (that would draw the series back for its next installments) and guns all over the place. the mechanics work well, but its buggy, has a very poorly designed and unoptimised UI (with unit cards being tiny in MP, and the campaign UI being so shrunken and off mods are a MUST) overall, its a choppy attempt at colonial warfare. Is it fun? Hells yea, but Im a die hard total war fan- and the UI is genuinley unbearable. To the point where I will stop playing halfway through a turn. For a first installment in the 'new' total war franchise, its not a ragged abortion like Rome 2, but not a work of strategic art, like most of the first series, especially Medieval 2 and Rome TW. Also, naval warfare... personally I think they did it as best they could, but its complicated, hard to master and REALLY annoying at times. Its nice due to demand after the other games, but leaving it out would have saved shogun 2 and Rome 2's naval battles some credibility. AI is worse than the other games in my opinion, only trumped in Rome 2 for its flaws- and that is saying something. Overall, its a shoddy mess of a creative assembley idea- but it gave way to Napoleon and Shogun 2, the latter of which is top 3 in the series. So if you want an opener into the new engine before exploring the vastly superior titles later on down the line- empire is your jam. But if guns aren't your thing, then the butter is in Shogun 2 , Medieval 2 and Rome TW.  Oh, and dont give the modern neo-capitalist devs the bread which is DLC, because if the run button becomes dowloadable content in the next one then you might as well have this game to play instead :) I reccoment empire total war, it may be the sad, discarded love-child of the franchise, but we love it anyway :D
5695	1	a	it is fun for a little bit. the turn sytem is still broken. takes forever. and puckle guns cheat. it is a minature ♥♥♥♥ing gatling gun. it is overall pretty good thouigh
5697	1	a	This game is far from perfect.  The worst thing is that you cannot save during battles, or during the opponents' turn. If various computer opponents attack you ten times between your turns, you never get to save, and unless you auto-resolve the battles, each battle may run 1-2 hours and you might have 10-20 hours of fighting before you can next save the game. For me, the game was very stable, but leaving it dominating my gaming computer for a week or more without being able to save did not feel good. Once you start to dominate, you rarely have to fear attack, and this type of long, drawn-out slug fest turn disappears, but until then, expect to leave the game running all the time... And you never get to save in mid-battle.  Saved games are huge on your HDD. Big enough that I stopped keeping my saves from the beginning and end of each turn, but started to recycle a group of 10 saves instead. Beginning and end of turn, and beginning and end of every battle. In a hundred turn game, they add up unless you recycle.  Ships. Nice to see ships, but the battle system felt really contrived. For example, the sailing ship fights give small ships a longer range than larger ships. That's the opposite of reality. Secondly, ships can only run away once per turn - again, that doesn't reflect reality, where small ships could run away from the big battlewagons each and every time they saw them, and only had to fear frigates. Then there's the whole: spin your ship like a top strategy. It just didn't work with big ships in reality. But it works in Empire. Spin one direction, fire. Spin the other direction, fire. And yet...it's fun to watch your ships batter the other side's ships to pieces.  Seiges. Are handled terribly. The computer just doesn't know how to attack a fort very well, or defend a fort very well. If you wait a couple of turns, a more sensibly managed battle takes place just outside the fort, but tying up your army for two turns anywhere is frustrating.  Setup. Even outside forts, the computer can give itself some utterly terrible opening setups - most terribly when it entrenches its artillery.  Armies. Armies start out tiny. Not simply poorly armed and trained: tiny and poorly armed and trained. Why?  Stacks. Are limited to 20 units. Battles are limited to 20 units PER COUNTRY. So if you have three stacks of twenty units, you only get to deploy 20 units at a time. Toughest and most satisfying battle I fought was against a stack of 20 French units, reinforced by 20 Spanish units and several French units. None of my units routed, despite fighting against 40 enemy units at once, and having one opponent's units (the French) getting reinforced by a fresh unit whenever a unit of theirs routed. Oh, normal difficulty - you're the best!  Government leaders. Are random and can have HUGE effects on your ability to wage war. It'd be nice to be able to disable that wildcard, 'cause mostly I enjoy the battles. And for that matter: it'd be nice to have a summary of the effects of all your government leaders.  All that bad, and still...watching my little men kill the little enemy men is fun. And so is taking over the world. I don't know why. About 100 hours at the keyboard for a grand campaign? I think I played three of 'em. Russia, Britain, Britain. Britain is by far the easiest.
5699	1	a	the game is fun I recommend you to buy it. I give it a 9/10
5701	1	a	Out of the whole entire Total War series to date as January, 20th, 2014 is the most extensive in terms of covering the Globe. By covering the globe land terroritories in North America all the way to the Northern parts of South America, Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East connecting into India, and also multiple islands in multiple waters such as the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and also the Indian Ocean. Also uses Maritime Sea trade routes that require building two types of Navies: Merchant Trade Fleets and Fleets full of Warships for protection and to fight other Empires/Nations and even Pirates for trade route ports. The Sea Trade routes include the following locations: the Coast of Brazil (South America), Ivory Coast (Southwest Africa), Madagascar (Southeast Africa), and also the East Indies (South Pacific). Plus a good game to help learn a little History and Geography. Empire: Total War is a good game to help assist in the learning of the Era in History we call the 'Enlightenment' that helped shaped the modern world that we live in. Will you follow history or will you create your own alternative history of the time period?
5703	1	a	If you like turn-based strategy and watching long lines of infantry spend 95% of the time in combat reloading, then this is the game for you
5705	1	a	Alone or with DarthMod, Empire: Total War is by far the game I like most of all the Total Wars. If you like Red Coat world domination, this is definitely a game that can satisfy your needs. Naval combat is nice, but can be a pain when controlling manually. Land combat offers nice variety of units, especially with the DLCs that, when in a bundle, are not to be upset over.  There is nothing like having a nice line infantry battle, so if you're into Patriot and Sharpe series, this is a game for you.
5707	1	a	Its a game that has incredible depth, you'll be playing Empire Total War for months
5709	1	a	Great all round total war game easy contolls good graphics
5711	1	a	 
5713	1	a	This is an amazing game, especially for tacticians and people who love historic warfare like me. I would definately reccomend this game, Sega and Creative Studios really hit this one out of the park.
5715	1	a	THIS GAME IS INSANE!!! I ENJOY IT A LOT AND YOU MUST BUY IT. SINGLE PLAYER IS AWESOME AND MULTIPLAYER IS AMAZING. GRAPHICS ARE REALLY GOOD. BEFORE I BOUGHT IT PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO PLAYS MULTIPLAYER BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT I SAW THAT THERE ARE A LOT. 15$ IS NOTHING FOR THIS AWESOME GAME. YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY IT!!!
5717	1	a	A great game if you're a fan of large battles with muskets, cannons and cavalry, 18th century warfare, RTS/TBS or just killing danes.
5719	1	a	Sometimes I stare out my window pondering the best way to maximize my gainz.
5721	1	a	Recommend it a lot for RTS-lovers. Huge map, you can conquer North, Central and part of South America, part of Asia and Europe. Doesn't have good graphics like Napoleon Total War but it has more possibilities of gameplay.
5723	1	a	The time period is cool and the scale is massive! It sucks without DMUC 8.1 though.
5725	1	a	Not the best Total War game, but a must for fans of the genre/series. A different take on global conquest than usual.
5727	1	a	After Logging over 50 hours in this game I can say that it is easily one of my all time favorite strategy games. I was blown away by the map size; spanning 4 continents, and also by the intracacy of the in-game economy and diplomacy. If this game was only a real time stragegy battle simulater, it still would have been worth $20. This game is well woth anyones money if theyre looking for a great hybird between a Real Time and Turn Based strategy game.
5729	1	a	One of the many installments of the Total War game series, Empire Total War is really a bit different from the earlier installments. First off, the graphics look great and the gameplay is nice and smooth. In Empire Total War you can actually fight sea battles (which was not possible in earlier installments) which can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥, but rewarding and fun at the same time. The premise is quite simple: choose one of the many populations and expand your territory and crush your enemies. Many changes have been made in the gameplay (in respect to e.g. Rome Total War) which make for a more realistic gameplay. For instance, you can now demand a besieged city for its honourable surrender and every city has it's own 'Town Watch' so you don't have to leave garrisons in all of cities. However, not everything is better than its predecessors, for example: you can't hire mercenaries anymore, there is a fairly limited number of different types of unit and the AI has not improved as drastically as some of the other aspects of the game. All in all, Empire Total War is a brilliant game which looks nice, works smooth and can indeed be challenging. However, after a while it is not difficult to learn the weak spots of the AI (and there are quite a few) and you will notice that almost all battles will have the same pattern. Still, you will have quite a lot of fun (and sometimes frustration) from playing this game.

5733	1	a	'I'm sorry that we do not live in one country may not know a common language. Today the leaders of 200 countries, as the owners of 200 sheep farm shared by 7 billion people.' 2010.03 
5735	1	a	This game i great for history buffs,begginers or people just looking fer turn based strategy. Many campaigns and challenging gameplay make this game great. Only problem is laggy online gameplay, but that can be overlooked.GREAT GAME!!
5737	1	a	One of the best total wars titles out there, great gameplay, first introduction to naval warfare, 3 theatres of operations but you need mods to have any real challenge as the AI is very defensive and rarely attacks, also the maratha confederacy always becomes an overwhelming power unless you keep it in check from the start or limit theirs expantion by conquering the mugals!
640	0	a	The only reason I'm not recommending this is because the font size is small, blurry and unreadable, and there's no way to fix it.
5739	1	a	It won't let you leave your game. You should think twice before buying this game cause you will be glued to your seat and you will be playing this game for long long hours..
5741	1	a	Despite the Bugs this game has Epic scope
5743	1	a	This game features empires from the 1700-1800 era. All the patches that have been added since release helped it improvment. It features a turn-based campaign map with lands to explore and conquer ranging from the Americas, all the way to India and North Africa. And when 2 armies clash on the campaign map, you can fight the battle in a 3D real time strategy map controlling musket infantry and cavalry, to artillery and sword-wielding eastern infantry. 10/10
5745	1	a	Dear Reader of this Review:   Empire: Total War is the most emotional, connective, personal, grudging, and eventually, important Total war game, to date. You may play as a european nation, however, this is not where your war takes place. Instead of fighting in europe, your forces fight for the new world. America, and in some cases, India.  You need trade for money. The trade is here. Therefore, everyone fights over it. And all the money you earn goes right back into your military to KEEP fighting for it. This is Total War at it's peak. HUZZAH!!!
5747	1	a	This game is great. If you like strategy, warfare games then it's perfect for you. The game is even better if you download the Darthmod. This is by far one of the best games of the Total War series, possibly one of the best strategy war games on the market.
5749	1	a	PLAY TEH MOTHER♥♥♥♥IN GAME!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. The AI isn't all so great but the game and the campaign is awesome, I've logged almosed 200 hours into this game, it is truly a good game
5751	1	a	Empire war is a fantastic game.  buy it.
5753	1	a	Great game, ive heard that the newer games are bad but i played this and it was good. From what i know about 1700's/1800's history it seems historically acurate. YOu can see each unit reloading (with the exception of the rocket platform which does nothing for a long time and then reloads one rocket which turns into 6) but they seem to miss the barrels with the ram rods. just one more minor annoying thing, is that infantry inorder to fire, everyone i mean everyone has to be reloaded unless it is light infantry, which seems to be less trained but longer ranged. The naval is fun though a bit harder than the land. Sometimes the ai is a bit weird but i dont see many problems with it, also cut this game some slac it came out 5-6 years ago, technoloy has come a long way. Now ive said alot of bad things 'what about the good' well its strategy is fun, it has formations, different ammo types for artillery, bayonet charges look awesome, it is highlarious when you charge right into enemies and they fly back like 10 feet it is highlarious and fun to watch. The game seems well balanced and if a country has less units those units willl be a bit more powerful and more powerful units will be expensive. but i cant give you a good idea on the grand campaign i havnt played it much because i perfer the real time battles but it is a great game for the price so enjoy!
5755	1	a	Colonialism is so much fun.
5757	1	a	Absolutely freaking love it.
5759	1	a	Fun strategy game that can teach you a bit of history.
5761	1	a	As the somehow perfectly in control ruler of your pick of 18th century civilisations, the player will find that attempting to advance towards your countries goals (i assume they are determined by the actual colonial actions of these nations at the time) will make you exactly public enemy no. 1 as diplomatic relations tend to break down rather fast... with everyone at the slightest mention of Imperialist Expansion... even though the aim of the game is to expand .. imperially, seems counterproductive. Research is a must, once riflemen are achieved and manufactured en masse, absolutely no-one in india or in the Americas has any chance against these accurate fast-reloading geniuses and their ability to place explosives and stakes in the ground.  This game is very replayable, heavy in the fun factor and overall extremely enjoyable.  Played as Russian Empire, and after expanding down to Egypts border and rolling over sweden and conquering italy and germany I noticed that trade wasn't even happening anymore as everyone hates me, quickly enacted a revolution and decapitated the monarch's head while reforming into the glorious Russian Republic because technological research is badly hurt when attempting to play as an autocrat. I built thousands of farms and fishing ports and my economy was back on track, but i had lost syria and iran while i dillydallied. Religion is so annoying to manage in the game, making everyone Russian Orthodox was dangerous but it fixed everything when it finally happened. I found much hilarity and satisfaction in negotiating with unsuccessfully and progressively steamrolling Europe.  This game is a must for people like me!
5763	1	a	Best turn based stratergy avalible to buy
641	0	a	This is ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS.
5765	1	a	This is a pritty good game i love games like these and plz keep makeing more game
5767	1	a	A well made game. Would like to conquer more of the world though.
5769	1	a	best strategic real time strategy in the WORLD!
5771	1	a	Once more unto the breach, dear friends
5773	1	a	Great turned based and real time strategy game. Easily my favorite of the Total War series. Its not without its issues, no game is, but nothing is insurmountable to ruin the game.  Great gameply, great time period, and great battles (naval warfare is awesome). Excellent game.
5775	1	a	Mix TBS and RTS. Epic battles aroud world like America, Europe , Middle East or India. Build your own Emipire and overwrite a history!!
5777	1	a	One of the best total wars in the series. The map is huge, graphics amazing, its not glitchy, and the battles arnt bad. All around a great game. Get the expasion pacts they add to the game. If your looking for a total war get this one its bettert than shogun 2, and works better than rome2
5779	1	a	Fun if you like history, destroying history, or just destroying.
5781	1	a	Best Muth ♥♥♥♥♥' game i've ever played biiiiiiiitch
5783	1	a	The first game I own on Steam and one of the best ones I played yet. It mixes some great battle scenarios and tactics and also very intense turn based strategy, where you have to be on the lookout for everything. Recomended for anyone.
5785	1	a	a great game with many mods and gameplay to last for long time
5787	1	a	My personal favorite strategy game, period, end of discussion!
5789	1	a	Fantastic game overall. The first total war to be based on ranged troops works great. The graphics are good even by todays standards, there is variation between the units of the different countries, and tons of modding support for it. You can literally never get tired of it. The technology addition from medieval 2, based not on city size but educational buildings to advance and get bigger and better units. There is some crappy formation issues with the AI who has no clue what its doing half of the time, but there are mods to fix those issues. I highly recommend the warpath addon, highly. The empire total factions mod is good to get. 9/10 fantastic, with the warpath campaign, almost perfect. Pick this one up if you like the other total war games, if this goes on sale, its a no brainer to pick up.
5791	1	a	medieval 2 is so much better, different time but that doesnt matter
5793	1	a	It's a very epic game. I like Ntw better but it will keep u busy for a long time.
5795	1	a	Empire total war delivers a punch to the gaming industry and in the strategy genre in general. Set in 1705 you start as a glorious nation which has to conquer some cities and islands(ex Bahamas) to win. The game has great graphics and the naval battles are my favorite due to the impressive unit design. Land battles and sieges are even greater and YES, this game is a must buy option for anyone who loves the strategy genre
5797	1	a	Best Total War in my opinion
5799	1	a	A must have for Total War enthusiasts!
5801	1	a	If you have been looking for a game that incorporates complete full scale wars, then Empire: Total War is your game. The graphics are great, the realism is amazing, and there are huge ammounts of soldiers dueling it out with mount and musket.
5803	1	a	It's the best strategy game ever
5805	1	a	This game is a very fun combat simulator, in which you actually feel like a general commanding your troops to victory. Or loss. This game gets really addicting at times and I reccommend it to everyone.
5807	1	a	My personal favorite of the Total War games, very good gameplay and the nval battle are great if you know what your doing. 8/10
5809	1	a	Very fun RTS, history can be drastically rewritten. Advised to everyone who likes feeling dominant on a battlefield.
5811	1	a	defintly a hit for those who want to control the battle but not those who actully want to be the one fighting in the battle
5813	1	a	simply the best :)
5815	1	a	This game is loads of fun. Only complaint is that it has getting old, but then again I have been playing for over 300 hours.
5817	1	a	Great Game the best in the series so far. well worth the money. plus im starting to like the whole steam thing.
5819	1	a	Its a very good game!
5821	1	a	Love this game. Classic
5823	1	a	I really love this game but the constant crashes let it down I really hope the makers fix this
5825	1	a	I love the way this game has been made. The real-time battles (both land and naval ones) are simply incredible and the Grand Campaign (where you select a nation and you conquer like everything) is one of my favourite features. Also being a huge fan of the Prussian Empire makes me like this game even more, since it's in the game XD
5827	1	a	745 Hours in four years. it speaks fot itself.
5829	1	a	This game is definitely tied with my favoirte of the Total War series. It was either this one or the Fall of the Samurai expansion for Shogun 2: Total War, and I don't feel comfortable saying an expansion is my favorite game. This game introduced gunpowder and new tactics that were only touched on in the Late period of Medieval 2: Total War. It made for an entirely new set of tactical challenges and strategies to deal with. New diplomacy, trading, and society functions like 'Clamour for Reform' made the game more interesting than the previous games of the series. Plus, ranks of gunpowder infantry... awesome.
5831	1	a	this is a very good game it so awesome
5833	1	a	What are you doing reading this? Shouldn't you be taking over the world right about now?
5835	1	a	Conquer the world as an 18th century civilization. This is the pinnacle of achievement for the Total War franchise.
5837	1	a	If you were to throw together Civilization and a RTS game, this is what you would get. Defending cities from armies ten times your own, carefully planning an invasion of a city that is guarded by thousands of troops, all adds up into one hell of a fun time. Buy this game.
5839	1	a	Great game!!!
5841	1	a	love this game, but theirs only one problem. The game lags alot and runs slowly, I'm even running it in low quality but the game still runs slow. Any suggestions that may help making it run faster? other than my problems, the game is great. 10/10
5843	1	a	Great game if you're into imperialism and RTS'.
5845	1	a	This is One Man God and I recommend this game
5847	1	a	Despite its rocky, bug addled realease in 2009, Emipre Total War is a solid game in the Total War franchise. If your looking for a Total War game with guns, Napoleon Total War and Fall of the Samurai are both more mechanicly adept, however no other Total War has the scope of Empire's Grand Campaign.
5849	1	a	It's ok.
5851	1	a	Put Simply an awesome game! I cant stop playing it i just want to conquer everthing and everyone and make damn! sure i have the biggest and best armies, and with the amazing Mods made by the fans added in making the armies countless of thousands strong, it just makes a remarkable game to play!   10/10 
5853	1	a	great game if your intrested in industrial revolution combat and in depth history of the time and oh, hah! love the patriot movie this is the game for you
5855	1	a	A solid installment to the Total War series and worthy of the genre. Pick it up today and you will be glad that you did.
5857	1	a	A fantastic RTS game. Controls are easy and the battles are engaging. Requires a moderate to high end PC.
5859	1	a	I recommend this game if you love freedom of choice, 1700s, ruling governments, and classical European warfare.
5861	1	a	zwhat a great game. It such a time sink but fun. the map is soo large and it contains soo much faction, if you pair it with DarthMOd it is delicously entertaining.
5863	1	a	awsome love the game
5865	1	a	I actually liked this game a lot as it is more complex and more massive than pretty much all of the other TW games. There really is not much to say about it that is memorable, but overall it is a solid TW expereance with few flaws. I would buy at $10 or below.
5867	1	a	I have loved the Total War series since the first Rome, but Empire has to be my most favorite of the series. I have played this game over and over, and it has never disappointed me yet. Some friends have remarked to me that they did not enjoy the complexity of the game. However for me, that was one of the most interesting features offered by Empire. For some all the options may feel a bit daunting, but if you truly delve into everything this game has to offer, I am confident you will find it strategically and tactically interesting of all the Total War titles.
5869	1	a	Great game with lot of fun.
5871	1	a	great game. get civil war mod or darth mod to improve experience
5873	1	a	After the patches the game is very good but it still has some bugs and the campaign isn't the best. I find it better than Napoleon Total War. If you like the era and can live with some bugs buy it.  7/10
5875	1	a	Game is fun, just it's rare to have random problems in the middle of a game and exits the game.
5877	1	a	very good game but poor about technical knowledge
5879	1	a	Great game
5881	1	a	One of my favs and part of my must have top 10
5883	1	a	Brilliant game. Still one of my top 3 of the Total War series, if not number one.
5885	1	a	Old ish game still fun kick assbuy!  9.5/10
5887	1	a	Empire is the best Total War game in my opinion. The ACW (American Civil War) mod adds a new and brilliant dimension to an already perfect global strategy war game, but this mod can be unstable. I wish the company would take the mod and turn it into a full game like Empire is, with accurate sounds and graphics of the era.
5889	1	a	The game is a great turn based game. If you like turn based games if not then dont get it. The map is hugh and theirs alot to do alot. a big selection of nations makes it fun. It a slower paced game and that works perfect for this game. Ive played ten hour and not bored yet. The options are good you have alot of choices for your game play. I would give this game a 8 out of 10 for now i will update later.
5891	1	a	I'm not actually sure if i should click the button for 'I dont recommend this game'. Because I'm conficted, the first time i saw this game was at a friends house, he got a huge bundle with all the DLCs on Origin, a less popular version of steam. I always tell him that everyones gonna go to valve with the major titles but that's beside the point. For the fisrt month or so it was really interesting! I approached it like civilization V and failed miserably. Yes its a stratagy game, but its more battle stratagy than interacting with other nations to allie with you. So if you enjoy stratigising and commanding little men then go wild with this! But I got bored with it after a while so if your like me, dont buy it. Buy Toribash!
5893	1	a	An Amazing Game I Recomend it!!!!!!!!!!!!
5895	1	a	Great game for the year it came out, historical buffs will love the refrences in the DLC to units like the 'Deaths Head Hussars.'
5897	1	a	A fantastic game. Great grand campaign length, probably the best engineered campaign of the series. However, I find the character/agent interaction a tad lackluster. Regardless, this game is worth it.
5899	1	a	Empire: Total War was an extremely enjoyable game to play. Single player was impressive, featuring both land and sea battles. The turn-based campaign system continued the evolution of the proven Total War style and the addition of multiple regions - I.E. North America and India - greatly expanded the game's realm of regions and nations. Despite the limited number of maps, the multiplayer was always entertaining in one way or another against other players of varying skills. Entertaining, that is, as long as your opponent did not resort to that annoying light infantry 'meat shield' nonsense.  Empire: Total War, however, suffered from several major drawbacks that were addressed and amended in Napoleon: Total War but were never retroactively applied to Empire. In 2010, Empire was essentially abandoned by the developers at Creative Assembly who seemed to put their undivided attention onto the release and expansion of Napoleon: Total War. The rush to leave behind fellows such as the Duke of Marlborough, Frederick II and William Howe in favor of Wellington and Bonaparte seemed very obvious (such as there only being four historical battles to play in ETW). This should not be too much of a surprise, however, since CA is a UK based company and the Brits have this unexplainable fixation with the Napoleonic era opposed to any of the other major conflicts of the Georgian time period. That said, Empire: Total War did showcase many signs that there was at least some contribution from real historical advisors behind the scenes. There were accurate descriptions and background information for each unit that could be recruited and there were countless facts, achievements and progress milestones of the 18th century as a whole featured in the turn based campaign mode. On the other hand, CA seemed to have left their software artists and developers to create visual material based on their own erroneous assumptions on things such as troop uniforms and accoutrements. The naval gameplay was praised as being a first for the Total War games, but it basically was mirrored directly off of the naval gameplay in Edios's awful 'Imperial Glory' that was released back in 2004. Empire's version was graphically superior with a Total War touch, but the naval gameplay system was pretty much identical to that in 'Imperial Glory', right down to the broadside control panel. Naval power was far too balanced among nations, so it was extremely frustrating to encounter pirate fleets with horrendously overpowered galleons and nations such as the Maratha Confederacy with multi-deck ships of the line. The naval engagements were still fun, a sight to behold when many ships were engaged in battle and were always the most challenging aspect of the game. However, I purchased Empire: Total War the month it was released in 2009 for the land battles. Eighteenth century armies were expensive to raise, train, supply and equip. Campaigns were therefore usually more like a game of chess rather than a war of total destruction; the object was to maneuver here, besiege a city or a fort there and drive your opponent from the field when the battle was joined. Total War's gameplay, however, dictated pure body counts and defeating your enemy in detail. Smoothbore musket accuracy was therefore exaggerated, even though the muskets of the day could not accurately hit anything beyond 50 yards. Unfortunately, the AI controlled units in ETW were all pretty much created upon the old software framework dating back as far back as Medieval: Total War. The AI therefore had a preponderance at times for all-out melee fights and had a knack for always deploying in deep formations even though only the first 3 ranks could fire.  That said, the game's 'three rank fire' system was clunky (an entire formation of line infantry would wait for one guy to reload) and seemed to have been copied from a scene from the film 'Zulu' and not from any military history research. Historically, all three ranks in tight formation in the 18th century would usually fire a single volley together, either as one entire regiment/battalion/brigade, or by alternating sections along the line on the platoon/company/regiment level depending on the size of the formation. Another 3-rank method was where the front rank only would fire and then retire to the rear so the next rank could then step up and fire after they passed. Curiously, this had been accurately portrayed way back in Shogun: Total War with the arquebus units, but was not available in Empire. Having to spend several turns researching things such as rank fire and the 'fire and advance' maneuver when they were already standard in Europe by 1700 was very annoying.  Many of the finer details, such as uniform designs, were obviously created by the studio artists who had a limited knowledge of the time period. Units lacked uniformity in their musket designs and in their 'uniforms', which, no matter what year you were in during the game, all looked like costume interpretations of was worn in the 1760's. While muskets units had a limited range, they seemed as effective at 5 yards as they were at 100. There was no design variation from regiment to regiment, soldiers’ heights, etc. Artillery units all had the same range capability (shrapnel shot was not widely available until well into the 19th century) and massive 24 pounder siege weapons were turned into standard issue guns at a time when 3-pounder and 6-pounder pieces were dominant. Fixed siege mortars were given the power and range of WW1 artillery batteries. Grenadiers had beards at a time when facial hair, especially in 18th century western European armies, was prohibited. Native American tribes were able to field armies of thousands upon thousands of warriors. Drummers on the march beat their drums like a hummingbird flapping it's wings, when in fact they were there to set a much slower beat for troops to march to. Rifle units, with their deadly accuracy, loaded as fast as musket units, had swords (even the American riflemen wearing hunting frocks) and unreasonable hand to hand fighting skills v. other infantry. While many of these issues were thankfully fixed in Napoleon: Total War, it pretty much put a damper on the gameplay in Empire. CA eventually corrected many of Empire's early glitches and bugs and expanded the game with DL content, such as the War of Independence units, which, despite the blatant uniform flaws (like the Royal Welch Fusiliers uniform, which was totally wrong), was a great addition to the multiplayer. In the end, was Empire a good game? Most definitely yes. Once you got past the little quirks, many of which would only be noticed by those knowledgeable in the period, there were plenty of times ETW was extremely impressive with its scope and downright beautiful graphics. Empire turned out to be not just mindless strategy and conquest - this game expanded the historical knowledge of anyone who played it. For example, how many who played ETW knew beforehand that the British used light infantry tactics extensively in the American War of Independence? I look forward to when CA returns to this time period in the years ahead to make ETW 2. I just hope CA would contact more historians and historical reenactment groups in the future, since these individuals and groups would gladly help out CA to make sure the period was accurately portrayed!
5901	1	a	It's really fun, you play as the hidden dictator or something, because the deaths of your countrie's leaders have no effect on your gameplay, except for relations, but that's a different story. You also play as a general, leading your multple troops to victory, either by storming forts, capturing cities, or interception their movements. You can also play as an admiral, commanding multiple ships, you have a choice of either grape shots, single shot, or chained shot from each ship, there's also a wind element, so if your enemy is upwind, you better not try to retreat. You can capture enemy ships, but not troops (makes sense). In the freeplay mode or something, you have 3 major theaters and a couple trading routes. The major theaters are India, Europe, and North America (including northern South America. It's pretty realistic, the game takes place in one cetury, but it lasts 400 turns (I think). Unlike Civilization V, you don't have to manage workers, but instead you build roads and stuff directly from the cities themselves. I REALLY liked this game, but it's not for everyone. The turns are really slow, and sometimes during the later years, you have no significant opponents. When this happens, you can start a revolution and side with the rebels.
645	0	a	Maybe this is what it feels like to not be into 4X games and try to play one?  There might be a group of people who're into slow gameplay, clumsy controls and limited variation in play, but they're not me.
5903	1	a	best history game ever made
5905	1	a	This has always been one of my favorite strategy games of all time. Very good rts feeling. Really cool to see such realistic historically accurate units, borders, and buildings, + strategies and menuvering. If someone is up to a challenge the campaign proves to be highly difficult with levels of critical thinking and strategy. Both the land battles and naval battles are well laid out. 8.5/10
5907	1	a	Release-2009  Battles-9/10 Campaign-9/10 Multiplayer-8/10 Overall graphics-9/10  Overall-8,75/10
646	0	a	Empire total war would have been a good game but the Ggame has too many bugs and is unable to work on windows 7 without crashing.   The general gameplay is good and graphics are well presented but the constant crashing once you have too many units and areas under your control make this game unplayable (that being cannot finish). This is well documented in many forums and the developers are very out of touch with their customer base but not fixing the errors correctly.  If you can pick this game up for 2-3 dollars then it will give you a good insight into total war games but be warned you will not finish a large game.  
5909	1	a	From all the Total war series, I believe that this is far the best, ease of use, managability, no doubt that this should be the basis for future Total war games
5911	1	a	This game really does walk you through history and is very intellectual. I highly reccomend buying it, it's worth your money and you can play as every major country, so it is a long game if you play it all.
5913	1	a	one hell of a fully comprehensive game
5915	1	a	Empire: Total War is a game that all strategy game players should own. It's campaign is deep and rich with content, with endless choices to be made. The Road To Independance campaign is also realistic and cunning, bringing back battles like, the battle of Bunker Hill, and so on. This game forces you to think about every little detail and brings out the inner general in you. The naval warfare is intense with many variables in play, like the types of cannon show, or the formation of ships. The animations of all the units are flawless, and seiges are interesting and challenging to the mind. This game challenges the mind and brings out the inner general or admiral in you. I definitely recommend this game for those new and old to strategy.
5917	1	a	Been playing the Total War series since the original Shogun; They cant be beat.
5919	1	a	Great game perfect balance of turn based and real time strategy, im actually new to the total war games and i have been addicted to this game. If your a history guy like like me then you will like it even more the politics of the age are very accurate, how diplomacy was conducted how etc. I reccomend this game to any history guy or gal of course and i also reccomend this game to huge time strategy fan.
5921	1	a	As someone who has logged 350+ HOURS into Empire Total War, I can safely say that this is is one of the most enjoyable and strategic of the Total War franchise. If you have any interest in strategy games or history, pick this up. Seriously.
5923	1	a	This game is a great Total War, though perhaps not the best of all. In my experience, it redefines the pretty structured systems of previous Total War games, instead moving away from strong Heavy Infantry based armies, to range warfare (obviously). Any of you who have played Total War games before (except Napoleon or Empire itself) will find that your previous strategies that could be transferable from say Rome to Medieval, will not apply here. Instead of totally relying on infantry, you will find yourselves using Cavalry and Artillery more in your strategies (although every General has a different play style, this is what I experienced).  The Campaign map is stunning, and although the extra cotton farms and things promise to redefine how attacking a province works, it dosen't that much, you only get the effect of blockading ports as with previous Total War games. Also, players new to strategy games will find the huge campaign map quite daunting, but the Road to Independence campaign is the best Intro/Tutorial game of any Total War I have played.  The Naval Battles are incredibly challenging, especially as I had only played up to M2TW before this, you are literally thrown into the deep end (albeit with a tutorial), and this is a good thing, it brings into light the importance of navies at the time. Players new and old will enjoy them. The visuals are absolutely stunning, sometimes even on the lower Graphic settings (for huger battles), I was still awestruck at the beautiful scenery in the game, although performance does drop if you have smoke on higher settings, but it is bearable. However, despite the massive change in time period and combat style, in terms of Total War games, it isn't that revolutionary. Some may find this to be a bad thing, but in my experience it just refines the Total War experience as a whole, instead of completely flipping the engine and changing things completely, they build upon their already large success. Summary: + Outstanding gameplay, typical of any Total War game. + Outstanding visuals, your eyes will not be dissapointed. + Redefines the already successful Total War formula, adding systems like the Tech Tree (which you personally may or may not like, I did) - Not that much variation between factions, other than starting position in the campaign. - Performance isn't as steady as I would like, especially on lower end machines 9/10
5925	1	a	Fantatic! It make me happy.
5927	1	a	its a very fun game especially playing as the ottomans and the battles are nice to watch
5929	1	a	Let me start off by saying that I love this game. I've put quite a few hours into it and have yet to get bored. This title, like all of Creative Assembly's Total War titles, has HUGE replay value. Now that being said, I feel that with this game, CA has gone forward, yet at the same time gone backward in some respects. There were things that they could have done, could have added, that would have made this game perfect in my book.   The pros: Expanded map. Their biggest one yet. This map includes the Americas and South Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India), which is a huge plus for me. The bigger the map the better. I really enjoyed the fact that there are mini-towns littered around region capitals. It adds a new dynamic of urgency and believability to the campaign. I also love how there are a ton of factions littering the map. The new technology feature is great, as is the addition of surprise emergent factions. The new battle mechanics that involve new firearms and artillery is excellent, as are the new naval battles. Whats not to love about that? Also, I love the revolution feature and how the dynamics of political change can screw diplomatic relations up. Top notch stuff. One great feature is the ease of hiring generals. This time around I did not have to wait for the AI to spawn one for me.  The cons: I would have loved to play every faction, such as the Mughals, the minor powers like Venice and Persia, and even emergent ones like Punjab and Mexico. I felt a bit teased to be honest, but the problem is fixable by a mod (Empire: Total Factions). I also felt that the characters traits had decreased from what was seen in Rome and Medieval 2. Speaking of characters, generals and admirals can be recruited as easily as any infantry unit, but why not rakes and priests? I understand the rationale about not being able to purchase new gentlemen (because of the technology rates and all), but at least let me buy rakes to spread havoc around!   Overall, this is a very good game and I feel comfortable recommending it to anyone.
5931	1	a	one of the best
5933	1	a	I couldnt enjoy it in its maximum because of hardware, but it is a good game. NAval battles, colonization and heavy trade-based economy.  
5935	1	a	in my opinion the most elaborated strategical pc game ever made, very addictive and full of historical moments. 9.5/10
5937	1	a	Still the best in the Total War series.
5939	1	a	nice rts game :D
5941	1	a	My personal favorite of the Total War series. The controls are much better than prevoius Total War games. The campaign is very fun. My only complaint is the naval battles, which I loathe. I think it's just because I don't have a mind for the naval combat strategy.
5943	1	a	
5945	1	a	If you are looking for a fast paced quick fix game, you are looking in the wrong place. If you are looking for an easy to play strategy game, you are looking in the wrong place. If you are looking for a game that has historical accuracy, tense gameplay and epic battles, you are looking in the right place.
5947	1	a	Still love this game. Left Rome 2 and come back to this game :)
5949	1	a	Addicting, but buggy game. 
5951	1	a	amazing in every way
5953	1	a	Great game if you like domination, history, and strategy
5955	1	a	good but you should be able to play grand campaing as america 
5957	1	a	It's kinda neat to see guys get blown-up, maimed, and killed in a quite orderly fashion.
5959	1	a	I got this game because I saw a friend play it for quite awhile. I was not disappointed. Do you like tactical games? Do you like history (Especially periods 1700-1799)? Do you like to build an empire and watch as it expands from France to Russia? If you answered yes to any of those, get this game, and you won't be disappointed either.   (Plus, the TF2 items are nice)
5961	1	a	The best Total War game, period! Yes Napoleon TW has seasonal attrition which is the only feature that is missing from this game, which lets face it should have been included as a patch. The sheer scale of this game, combat across the Americas, Europe and India it cannot be matched. Having played the disappointments that were Shogun 2 and more recently Rome 2, I always seem to gravitate back to Empire, its mix of naval and land battles were near prefect. It still makes we look on in awe when an enemy ship of the line explodes after a furious broadside exchange.
5963	1	a	The last good total war game?  The AI is still ♥♥♥♥ and the only way to make it hard is to allow them to cheat.  I would like more control over politics and marriages for example.
5965	1	a	This was the first game I ever bought from Steam, and it is still my favourite one. This stradegy game was perfect, from the Grand Campaign, to fighting individual battles, the fun never ends.
5967	1	a	Can't go wrong with any TW game, this is my favorite of the bunch due to its time period and theme. A must buy!
5969	1	a	If you are literally Hitler you will enjoy this.
5971	1	a	Extremly fun stratgey simulator with action, stragtgey, and diplomacy all in one.
5973	1	a	Great game! Its a must buy!
5975	1	a	this is a good game i play it on a crapy cheap laptop and on low i get 20fps this isnt great but its good for me. Huge campaign map and cool factions this is a very expansive game i would recommend it
5977	1	a	Fan of risk? diplomacy? Do you liken yourself a armchair napoleon? Do you like to subjugate vast civilizations militarily or dominate them through economic imperialism? This game is for you. You know to scratch your imperial itch...because you know the damn hippies won't let you have your fun in real life.
5979	1	a	Total War has always shown a great mix of historical accuracy, strategic depth, and tactical genius. Empire total war extends this thoguht process into a near era of game style. This game reflects well upon how the period conducted itself and helps you really grasp things associated with the period. I'd heartily suggest it for the Turn based strategy gamer who wants something faster, or the RTS gamer who wants more depth. It can also be fun first Turn based strategy experience for people not used to it since it ahs the fast paced Tactical Real Time battles alongside the grand map.
5981	1	a	A great strategy game!
5983	1	a	Best TW I've played so far, but that might be a fairly biased statement considering the setting.
5985	1	a	If you like the Civ Collection then you should be into this game. Has the same feel, direction, play stlyle, etc. Added twist is you can actually control the troops in the battle. definitely worth a play!
5987	1	a	There is a simple reason why Creative Assemly games are called Total War. It's because in the end it's always total war because they cannot program a ♥♥♥♥ing decent campaign AI. You can be allied with a nation for 50 years only for them to declare war randomly on you for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason whilst you having the world's largest military in the game. The Swiss is to just randomly declare war on you even though they have but only a single city guarded by one unit of melee warriors when you have legions of riflemen backed up with cannons.  Oh on a sidenote, never trust the ♥♥♥♥ing Dutch every ♥♥♥♥ing time they will backstab you.
5989	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! I love how you can be in India, America, and Europe with just about anyone. And it's so unpredictable. ♥♥♥♥ing love it!
5991	1	a	almost no lag with high graphic settings  depends on the amount of units really but your hardly ever going to have maximum amount of units at once ever
5993	1	a	I have to say, pretty well made for a turn based game, In fact, its the best ♥♥♥ kicking, butt ♥♥♥♥ing, War raving, World conquring Turn based/RTS Game out there. Considering it is both an RTS and a Turn Based Strategy game. And that goes for the entire series! I can't wait for Rome 2
5995	1	a	Empire: Total War is decent in vanilla. If you want the real thing: get DarthMod Empire, and you won't stop playing this awesome Total War game.
5997	1	a	Oh ♥♥♥♥ Bily is dead!!! everyone ♥♥♥♥ing retreat!!!
5999	1	a	the best Total War for me. It's a great era as it entails rifles as well as hand-to-hand weaponary so it has elements of all the best Total Wars. The graphics are outstanding and the gameplay top notch. The campaign is long and innovative if a little tricky. But for me the naval battles and multiplayer are the key parts.
6001	1	a	Awesome game! always love the total war games.
6003	1	a	top game a must buy :D
6005	1	a	This game is a game about murdering indians and british soldiers
6007	1	a	Great game 10/10 worth every cent. Cannons using canister shot is like a giant shotgun, very awesome, and just everything about the game is awesome.
6009	1	a	Empire total war is highly confusing to a player of old tw games, but after you've mastered it, it is extremely fun. I'd definitely recommend it.
6011	1	a	One of the best Total War games in my opinion with lots of management to go with the actual fighting.With nearly the full world to fight over an the addition of multiplayer it should be given a try especially as its quite cheap to buy now. I found mine in Gamestation for £12.
6013	1	a	pretty good
6015	1	a	just a really good game
6017	1	a	This game is just too awesome!
6019	1	a	This game is the definition of awesome! If you are looking for an in-depth, fun and great looking 4x turn-based strategy game with real-time battles set in the Renaissance Era then this is the game for you! I love this game! Empire: Total War will always be my favourite in the Total War series. I definitely recommend this game!
6021	1	a	great game...the best of this type
6023	1	a	The game is like a really big battlefield play ground for me. I love it.
6025	1	a	You like 17th century? You like gun powder, horses and tricornes? You like turn based strategy and big bad up to 10k units in a single battle? If you answer was yes for any one, this is THE definitive game for you! A must OWN!
6027	1	a	lazy on creative assemblies part, they rushed it and campaign AI is stupid, BUY only if you are a total war fan and if its under 20 dollars. still lots of hours played but the game ALWAYS crashes after turn 180.. etc they never fixed it, still fun and spent hours playing
6029	1	a	Outstanding game! First time playing total war and it is incredible. Very detailed and strategic. Fighting on the open seas is a rush! This game nails it. I just wish I found it sooner. Try it, you will love it.
6031	1	a	From story, era of game, diplomacy options etc. the best of all 'Total War' games. The game mechanics is less dynamic than the preceeding titles, but the long-term motivation really equalizes that downpoint. More than worth playing!
6033	1	a	Love The Game! Excellent for all you total war fans out there!
6035	1	a	Don't Save your money, THIS GAME ROCKS!
650	0	a	Although I like the map sizes and the battle. The main problem, resoultion, I play 1600x900 and it hurts my eyes to watch it, really does. The graphic for the main map, not so great. The battles are lots of fun to play. Ship battles I have not played yet, so not rating that. Over all rating is a 4/10 from what I have played. Would I reccomend this to a friend, no. I would not buy this I suggest buying Shogun 2 it is alot better and very fun.
6037	1	a	A good game it is
6039	1	a	Solid game. Love the firearm combat, and the ship battles are epic. Very nice looking graphics too. Must have for any total war/strategy fan.
6041	1	a	Not bad. Through it could use some tweaks, its a game you want to play.
6043	1	a	Those crazy Brits. :) 11/10.
6045	1	a	+
6047	1	a	A great exsample by the Creative Assembly with this 18th Century RTS For me I play it for Poland Lithuania
6049	1	a	Awesome game &lt;3 multiplayer a must buy
6051	1	a	This game has taken over my life at times.
6053	1	a	Awesome game 1000% better than Rome 2
6055	1	a	I spent 80 years colonising the Americas to get the rescources to go fighting in Europe. After 100 years i had the whole of America including portions of South America and the West Indies. I didnt send a single ship to India and the far east.  Massive, excellent game.
6057	1	a	shoot all natives in the faceto win the game
6059	1	a	i like to make gigantic armies to shoot people
6061	1	a	This is a great game, the graphics are neat and it is cool to see the mesket men run accross the battle fiels.
6063	1	a	When you get DARTHMOD for this game it becomes Da bomb yo !
6065	1	a	Fantastic game series, I recommend buying them all. Literally every single one down to Shogun.
6067	1	a	Great game but you really need darth mod for the more history part of it.
6069	1	a	Empire: Total War  Pros: Turn based strategy game, great replay value. Price. Great campaigns. Cons: Errors, AI sucks, lack of uniqueness  Great replay value: The campaign is very fun, each country has their own unique set of challenges and issues you have to deal with throughout the game. A fun example, would be the French Grand Campaign, there is potential for fighting the French civil war or stopping the Americans from gaining their freedom while playing as the British Empire. Each and every empire has a set of exciting and challenging experiences that can change from game to game.   Lack of uniqueness: Empire Total War fails to permit individuality across most of the countries, almost all the major powers use the same units, leaving the ability to customize and makes use of variety of units non-existent. Unfortunately this applies to all the minor countries as well, such as, the native American tribes and the two Indian countries. One of the few saving graces, which all the countries share is the same selection of units. There is a large selection to choose from giving you a little customization in your armies.   Errors: To say there are errors in Empire Total War is an understatement, it truly is one of the most disappointing things about the game. Even with it being out for over five years, the errors are still very prevalent. Known campaign crashes, graphical errors and other game breaking bugs have yet to be fixed and probably won't be fixed.   AI is a disappointment: The combat strength in the AI is very poorly coded. You can use the same strategy in almost every battle and still come out on top. The battles start to feel very one sided. On top of that the AI never uses any kind of real strategy or war planning, they just send armies at fortified cities over and over again. Other things that would have been an easy fix would be for the AI to upgrade their units and not use the same units they start the game with, making late game not a game but a curbstomp.   Price: Even with all the errors throughout Empire Total War, it is well worth the non steam sale price of $15. The game provides several hundred hours of great in depth content, that is very enjoyable both in terms of tactical thinking in small battles, all the way up to planning your world domination.  
6071	1	a	One of the best games ever
6073	1	a	tis the awesome of the sauces
6075	1	a	I've played all the Total War games, except the latest one Rome 2. In my opinion Empire is the best one in the series. Really very well done.
6077	1	a	its awsome...lil bugs but overall awsome
652	0	a	i dont know if im just a huge idiot or what but i hate the combat in this game so so much
6079	1	a	very fun lots of historical accuracy and tactics
6081	1	a	good game keeps your mind ticking 10/10
6083	1	a	Brilliant game most played game on my game list multiplayer not as good as it use to be(mind it a few years old now) can get some really awesome mods for this game which can make you play this game for years to come highly recommended
6085	1	a	best game ever......i cant wait for the next release(like 1st,2nd world war)
6087	1	a	I am a huge fan of the Total War series, and this game still brings an amazing challenge. Graphics are awesome, gameplay is more complicated than previous Total War games, but is very rewarding when you succeed. All that stuff. lol.   Anyway, I rate this game a 9.5/10. It was pretty much completely awesome.
6089	1	a	Its pretty good. The game could have been great, but they left some stuff horribly broken.. Sieges are broken for instance, ships can get stuck on trade nodes, etc..   Never really understood the point of the Agents either, they just seem to be put in the game to make the player less efficient.
6091	1	a	This game is the best turn based strategy game ever made
6093	1	a	Naval Battles are really hard but it's a solid game and i give it a 8/10
6095	1	a	Empire: Total War is the first game in the series to allow naval battles to be conducted in real-time. In addition to the standard campaign mode, the game includes a special campaign that follows the development of the United States from the settlement of Jamestown to the American War of Independence. Players may also engage in recreations of several historical battles from the early modern era.
6097	1	a	2nd best TW game.  Nothing like watching an unorganized group of savages charge your line of disciplined minutemen.
654	0	a	Not that great. I thought I would like this a lot more, but it's not nearly as fun as Rome: Total War.   The naval battles are fantastic though, so that's pretty fun.
6099	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played. It gots everything. The game play is awesome. A lot better than previous gameplays but the only problem is its complex but maybe to complex. I liked the Mediaval 2 total war campaign for reasons like it was complex but not to over the top to confuse. Overall this game is very fun and i can play for hours.
6101	1	a	At first I was really hung up on this game, but with the time passed I notice a lot of drawbacks. the biggest of them must be the diplomacy system, which is virtually non-existing (as the title suggests it is a 'total war', but that does not go well together with the period setting in 18th century) and then the battle system in which the units clashing in melee combat always only fight one on one. So even if you send 200 men against 5, in reality only 5 of your 200 will fight. this is driving me crazy especially when you see that it is the sort of legacy which is in these games to stay. I am not even thinking about buying Rome II, now. it seems that the sequel has taken a turn for the worse.
6103	1	a	love everything about this game. a must have for war buffs
6105	1	a	If not for it crashes, this could be a great game.
6107	1	a	Very fun game! It is all there you got the diplomatic side, the battle side and the trading side of it 9.5/10
6109	1	a	one of the most addicting games i have ever played strongly suggest buying this game
6111	1	a	Yes I become addicted to this game for a very long time and even better it has many RP groups. 9/10-Badass seal of approval
6113	1	a	Absolutely AMAZING! Ive spent loads of time on this and i'm still not bored of it! Great if you play 'the last samurai' 's theme music during a sea battle, as the ship goes down. So funny and it seems like a real movie! I don't think i'll get bored of this game quickly:) Would be better if you could play as more countries in the campaign though, but that doesn't take anything away from the awsomeness of this game:D
6115	1	a	Beast campaign ever! It was so mind blowing! I toke over the whole entire world as Austria, i often found myself at school thinking over strategies while in class.
6117	1	a	Good little game if you like to muck about abit and if you like a good turn based strategy game :)
6119	1	a	Brilliant Game
6121	1	a	While perhaps not the greatest installation in the Total War series, Empire Total War still has it's upside. Mods are almost essential to avoid any of the bugs in its almost haphazardly put together engine, but once those are avoided it can be a worth while experience. An interesting game if 18th century warfare interests you at all.
655	0	a	I bought this game and it keeps glitching and making it to where i can not even play the game.
6123	1	a	Excellent strategy game and a must have for military history nuts of the colonial time period.
6125	1	a	Empirically pretty good. While not the black sheep of the series, this edition did make some total changes to the war mechanics.
6127	1	a	It is the Best TW game Ever!
6129	1	a	Gives you the feeling you get when the battle of Helm's Deep is about to begin. I hope more people get the oppurtunity to enjoy this masterpiece.
6131	1	a	great strategy game love fighting on the sea
6133	1	a	Epic game with a good mix of fighting and world development.
6135	1	a	It might be old, but it's still fun. Empire total war is perhaps one of the best of the total war series for one single reason, guns! Finnaly no more special units that are capable of firing weapons now we have every nation having some type of ranged combat involving gun powder. The controls are like the rest of the series (supurb) aswell as the graphics and character animations. The campaigns are fun and ingaging, aswell as really making your mind think like those great generals back in their time period. I've played more than a 125 hours and loved every minute of it. But of course the big thing about this game is the sea battles, the first of their kind. Well I must say i have never seen such good water effect graphics in my life, not to mention the ships being so heavily detailed alowing you to see everyone of your crew working at your command. The only flaw with this game in my belief is the increased time and low improvments of researching. It killed me seeying all my line infantry only firing with the 1st line while the other 2 just waited. It took ages to finnaly reserch to line firing, and by that time I had almost completed the game. Overall i still belive is is a fantastic game portraying the beauty of stragety and the total war series. 9/10
6137	1	a	i dont feel like writing much but yeah its really cool!
6139	1	a	same as medival but in the 1700s and new untis and a new ship battles
6141	1	a	Just simply amazing. A must play for RTS fans. 
6143	1	a	Very immersive and engagaing for hours at a time!
6145	1	a	Classic!
6147	1	a	Invade your enemies! Invade your neighbours! Invade your friends! Invade your family! Take over the world with genocide!
656	0	a	i imagine if you can deal with the awful control of your units on the battlefield, you can really really get into this game. however, i had no fun in the naval battles or land battles. love the campaign though.
6149	1	a	I really enjoyed this game! It was a very good game and worth buying.  My favorite part was the naval battles and the sieges, but the graphics are all over the place!
6151	1	a	I really like it, ESPECIALLY the naval combat. It is amasing. I reccomend it.
6153	1	a	awesome game love it
6155	1	a	This game is excellent. By far one of the best real time strategy games out there. The large campaign map, that covers the majority of the world, gives you hours of gameplay.  It was the first Total War game to incorporate real time naval battles and they did an excellent job. There is good variety of ships and is the only part of the game that makes cannons effective. Unfortunately the AI strategy is exactly to same, every time. Also, AI nations tend to build smaller, weaker ships whether they have the ability to build better ones or not.  Land battles are excellent. The game handles extremely well, especially when you consider that there are sometimes several thousand men on the field. The strategy of the AI varies but is generally somewhat predictable but is very true to actual military strategy of the time. Cannons are extrmely pointless and have very little power. A direct hit usually isn't enough to kill soldiers. Siege battles are somewhat glitchy. Soldiers tend to fire ineffectivley from walls and cannons are still worthless unless used on walls.  AI diplomacy is the worst part of this game. Nations will be opposed to a treaty and will suddenly change thier minds in your next turn. Their decisions have very little logic and do not persue diplomatic actions with the player very often.  Overall, it is an excellent game. It is a definite must have for any RTS collection.
6157	1	a	One of the better Strategy Games I've played. Hands down a huge upgrade from Medievel II. The only issue is that sometimes things get glitchy.
6159	1	a	And what is to say about this game. well it was the first in the total war series to have Naval battles you actualy took part in, it was the first to be mainly composed of gun powder weapons, ect   the game is ground breaking for the TW series tho it does have quirks its still a very good game
6161	1	a	Take up the throne of one of the most powerful nations and try to conquer all the worlds theartes by peace or by force. watch your enemys and take their lands and see their weak forces try to defend their home but your men break them with ease. command the varios troops to use at their best for you will need to if you will conquer the world.
6163	1	a	Empire Total War, is in my opinion, the BEST in the series. It has everything in it, great naval battles, huge land battles, opportunities to spy and coerce. I have heard the graphics are really good, i haven't had a system that can play it with everything turned on full. Also being a Brit manageing to beat back the colonies and maintain the 'New World' as British and even knocking out the French in Canada is really refreshing!  But in al seriousness, this game has been out for a few years and still beats Shogun 2 and totally knocks out the new Rome. Its bug free and the DLC (if you bother) is nicely rounded out. THe warpath campaign is worth it to force out the colonists! I haven't played online as I don't do that so cannot give an honest reveiw of online features if there are any. Get this game. But then again, if you love the Total War series, you already have. For a smaller slice of this game get Napolean Total War!
6165	1	a	Probably one of the best RTS games in the entire genre. I defenitly recommend this game 100% to anyone that has an interest in turn-based RTS games, or an interest in the 18th Century! I've played over a thousand hours on this game and I still haven't lost interest yet!
6167	1	a	Being a total war fan i own every one and if im honest this was not my fav one of them all.   It become more about who had the bigger guns and i feel this takes away the magic that is Total War.  Even with this i still enjoyed my time playing this the once through and the sea battles have to be admired but unlike the other games they have produced, It only got the one play through
6169	1	a	You can invade small nations, no more needs to be said.
6171	1	a	Great Game Would Highly Recommend it Will run on even the worst computers.
6173	1	a	A game for smart people who want to command whole armies rather than take potshots in free for all. Wish I knew some.
658	0	a	Love the game, hate Steam.
6175	1	a	I bought this game because it was on sale and gave some sweet TF2 Items. I didn't expect it to be any fun especially because I usually dont like stratagy games. I was blown away by this game. It is probably the best RTS/TBS I have ever played!
6177	1	a	in order to enjoy this game you must buy it. its quite interesting you control tax, research, trade, funds, religon, troops, battles, buildings, technology, government, and diplomacy. it is a really good game. ive been playing religously for the past 3 weeks. i really sugest that you get it. its worth every cibernetic penny.
6179	1	a	Excellent game, though it isn't the best in the series.
6181	1	a	Solid strategy game. Really revolutionized the Total War series, IMO. If there is one total game you should buy to try, it would be this one.
660	0	a	Unplayable due to blurry Fonts
6183	1	a	Very hard at first but if you stick to it you'll soon see its an amazing game! Highly recommended however you must realise it's extremely hard at first and you must be willing to learn how to play! NOT A SIMPLE GAME
6185	1	a	 9.5/10 Similar to drugs. Great strategy game featuring war in land and sea , diplomacy and economical situations in the campaign. This is something even greater than Dota 2 or League of legends.   You have the ability not going on head to head into a war. By other means you can send assassin to kill generals or sabotage other nations. Or more importantly affect their economical growth by attacking trading ports or goods production areas.  Another part of it is to manage population and taxation , properly governing your nation to build the best empire kicking the rest out of your map.   Sun Tzu said : The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. 
6187	1	a	Play this!
6189	1	a	wish i could play ireland
6191	1	a	best game played in a long time need more like this
6193	1	a	This was the most Meh! game in the Total War series so far. Design decisions, like showing bullet paths, though understandable in their incorporation, took a lot out the battle immersion. I also was not crazy about the map being button split into the new world and the old world. I found this to be enough of a hassle that I basically ignored the new world in my playthroughs. Having said that, I picked it up with all the expansions and DLC from Steam for a song a while back and to be fair I have not played it since the original vanilla version. 7/10 for now. May change when I get a chance to play the full version and Napoleon.
6195	1	a	Awesome game! Would recommend it.
6197	1	a	very extensive game and detailed as well, but it can be quite heavy on medium to low rigs.
6199	1	a	Still not perfectly stable, but this map blows Napoleon away.
6201	1	a	This game is awesome. Get it.
6203	1	a	It is very good you are looking for a good total war here it is this game is worth $20
6205	1	a	Featuring the biggest and in my opinion, the best map, in the Total war game series; Empire Total War is a must play for people who like the age of Gunpowder Warfare and Colonization.  While the game has a great map and a large variety of factions, I would recommend that you play it with mods for the full and best experience; sadly the vanilla version of the game wasn't up to standards, the addition of a few mods though is the only thing one would need to enhance this game to what it should be.  In short, buy this if: -You like muskets. -You like great coats. -You like marching bands. -Tricorns and BICORNS!?! -Pirates -Biggest map that any total war game has had to date. -a whole load of other stuff that you'd expect would come with the time period.
6207	1	a	one of the most combat realistice games ive played yet. and the viewing capability is amazing as well. would recomend to ANYONE who has steam
6209	1	a	one of the greatest strategy games on the pc, with a great mix of turn based and rts gameplay. best played with darthmod though.
6211	1	a	Seriously fun game, you gotta use strategy and your brains :3
6213	1	a	hooked line and sinker........ little let down on city upgrade system as used to romes free flowing building frame but naval warfare compensated for bad build system...
6215	1	a	the best RTS for RTS lovers!
6217	1	a	Great game, especially when combined with some mods, but requires really good computer in order to play in High/Very High details.
6219	1	a	Adds an interesting twist to the Total War series. Just as with real war, guns really change the way you play. It's fun, but i'd suggest trying out Rome: Total War or something else first, then going to this.
6221	1	a	This is an extremely fun game! When it comes to playing on the battlefield, tactics are a good balance and doesn't become too difficult. The campagin has a nice flow to it and not too confusing overall. Little bit of micro-managaing but it's not too much of a problem. Overall I give this game a 8.5/10
6223	1	a	Empire Total war is an amazing game taking you into the era of colonization around the days of the american revolution. In the offline mode you can play as several different countries ranging from Great Britain to the ottoman empire.  The campaing map expands over the entire known world leaving nothing out of your wrathulpath to world domination. I spent numerous hours finding which country I liked best then set out to conqueor the world taking over europe first then reaching into the americas. In order to do this you must manage your economies and keep your people happy or they wont support your conquest overthrowing you and taking back their land.  This was my first total war game and probably one of my favorite. It comes highly reccomended if you like strategy games. It also has a online play where you can create your army and fight other people.
6225	1	a	do you like all the Total War games?? then is Empire TW what you looking for, it is very complicated but when you have play itr for more then 1 hour you're really enjoy it, 
6227	1	a	If you played any of the previous total war strategy games and found them enjoyable, I strongly recommend this game.
6229	1	a	Take over the world.
6231	1	a	The game is well made with very few glitches. The historical content is captivating and th campaigns are very immersive. However, some of he mechanics in region development and building devlopment lack in variety, but the game makes up for this with its vast and large campaign map.
6233	1	a	A very nicely made war game. Good for anyone who like good old fashioned warfare.
6235	1	a	I enjoy all the total wars, playing a game that I am familiar with is always nice.  I did enjoy the combat element with guns, may not of worked aswell as previous total wars that focused more on melee but it was a good effort.  
6237	1	a	Have an army of Swedes performing God's deeds.
6239	1	a	This game is great, involving the history and so. I love it and the whole concept of it
6241	1	a	This title is a must for fans of real time strategy and turn based games, although the AI controlled enemy can be dull and predictable at times the battles are mostly engaging and cinematic. Detailed management of your military and settlements and diplomatic relations with other factions make the experience very immersive.
6243	1	a	If you are into conquering the world, then this is for you... although it may be a little bit old now :p
6245	1	a	I assumed this time period wouldn't be as fun to play as say Medieval or Shogun, but oddly enough watching the plumes of clouds drift from your lines of infantry simultaneously watching the enemy lines fall is uniquely satisfying. If the 80 hours of time I've spent on the game isn't a good enough indication this game will give you hours and hours of enjoyment!
6247	1	a	The best real time battles and a turn based 'Risk' style board game to boot. Both are engrossing and now they've implemented naval warfare too. Superlative stuff. The most impressive visuals with thousands of different unit types on the battlefields, this game pretty much has it all. An undeniable classic
6249	1	a	Great game, challenging as some nations, but fun at the same time. Many people playing on multiplayer
6251	1	a	i like this game verry much i think its one of the best games out there
6253	1	a	Another great addition to the Total War franchise. With three maps (called 'theatres') used at once, and a time period spanning 1700 to 1825, this is a great 18th century stategy game.  9.5/10
6255	1	a	I love all the total war games but I always come back to Empire. Great Game
6257	1	a	I'm a huge fan of 4X games and this one does not dissapoint. It's not my favorite Total War game, but it delivers where it should. If you're a fan of Total War or other 4X games you deserve it to yourself to check it out.
6259	1	a	I believe that the creative assembly really hit the nail on the head with Empire Total War. Although I think that the siegebattles had greatley decreased in customizability from medeivel total war 2 I still think this was one of the best stratagy battle style games. The one thing I have never liked in total war campaigns is how there is always riots in my cities that i'm never sure how to sort out. But I still feel that Empire total war is my 2nd faveroute game in the series Rome total war 1 is my number one (as I havn't tried Rome 2 yet) and Medieval 2 as my 3rd and Shogun 2 as my 4rth. As the creative Assembley produce great sequals I can't wait for the return of Empire total war.
6261	1	a	This is a good game. It's really good. The turn-based strategy makes it feel similar to a game like Civilization V, and the real time battles make it feel like a more in-depth version of Crusader Kings II. It's a mixed bag of games, a combination of several styles. It's fun to play as well, especially with mods. Several people say that it's buggy, that it doesn't work right. I've never had a problem with it, but I've also never played any other Total War games to compare it to. I suppose after seeing some YouTube vids on other Total War games, they might be a tad better, but this is a great game regardless. It's got cool history and awesome battles, a must-have if you're an 18th century warfare fan.
661	0	a	Highly predictable AI in combat. Diplomacy can be immensely frustrating because no nation will agree to do anything. Naval battles are difficult and AI seems to kick the crap out of me every time I don't auto play a battle. Cosmetically uninspiring. Unit variety is lacking in many ways (stats, appearance, abilities) and watching any of the combats up close can be immensely depressing.  Fun, but only occasionally.
6263	1	a	Very good RTS game!
6265	1	a	Amazing! Only wish it had better demomatic options.
6267	1	a	Cannons and the Muskets.... Brah this game is the ♥♥♥♥!
6269	1	a	Grand strategy for those of us without the time or interest in micro managing every aspect of our empire. Gorgeous graphics, and a very shallow learning curve. Naval battles are a bit slow, but they look so good that you wont mind. The land battles, as always, are unlike any other game. if you liked previous Total War games, you will love Empire.
6271	1	a	way better then rome 2 total war
6273	1	a	Certainly very engaging as the naval battles are very exciting and global conflicts in Europe, North Africa, India, Middle-East and America certainly give you the sense when creating your own empire. Ground combat is very tactical, detailed and by far the best Total War game out there with Rome Total War happilly in 2nd place.
6275	1	a	very good even at year 2012 with a pop of 516 million and an income each turn of 4 million pounds
6277	1	a	When, as India, I invaded english soil and declared London part of the Indian Empire I knew I was hooked. The stories that you'll create in this game can be historically accurate, or they can be right out of an alternate history novel.  Love it,   When the game first came out, it had plenty of bugs with the AI and graphics, but those have been hammered out now. Great game!
6279	1	a	this game have a very epic scale of battle of the 18 centure
6281	1	a	Heck of a game fun for all
6283	1	a	Recommended, not only because the game is a very good RTS title, but mostly because I enjoy being the Iroquois settlers and exacting revenge on the American and British soldiers. Karma, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
6285	1	a	Bugged vanilla AI, but easily fixable with proper mods. When ran with Darthmod it's easily 9.5 out 10
6287	1	a	awesome game try it out!
6289	1	a	undoubtedly
6291	1	a	This game is amazing, and even more so with the mod DarthMod. During the next sale for the Total war games I reccomend you get it! Also, even when it's not on sale it's still cheap at 15 bucks. 15 bucks for hundreds of hours worth of content sounds good to me ^-^
6293	1	a	This game is great if you like violence drinking and patriotism
6295	1	a	One of the best installments for THE best turn based strategy franchise ever. Expansive and immersive, it's easy to sink over 200 hours into this game. The exceptional modding community too makes this game a must buy. The vanilla version is great, but with add ons like Darthmod, you are missing out if you don't buy this
6297	1	a	This game is by far one of the best Total wars games they have made. Filled with a gribing campaign and story line. It will trap you for hours a upon ended
6299	1	a	This game is a step up from previous games in the series due to the naval battles, the new entrenchment features units have, and worldwide domination. It's a great game.
6301	1	a	The Total War series is the leading frachise in realistic historical strategy games, making great titles like Rome TW and TW Shogun 2, but the Empire and Napoleon (very similar) have something severely lacking in them.Whether it's the stand-still-and-shoot-the-other-unit- feeling combat or the boring research or taking too long to capture a lot of provinces. Empire feels like it could possibly be one of the worst Total War games, sliding in there with the one I despise, Medieval II.  Empire:Total War - 6.5
6303	1	a	This is a fun game that take the Total War Series into new territory with its excellent ship battles and gunfire units.
6305	1	a	this game is one of the best i have ever played i bought it ages ago and am still playing now when ever i get the chance its brilliant
6307	1	a	Ever wanted to rewrite history? Ever wanted to create a dystopian world ruled by your country of choice? Ever wanted to completely crush Russia and wipe it off the map, destroying all remains of it's culture and people? I sure have... anyway, get this game, it's brilliant and entertaining as all heck.
6309	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played!
6311	1	a	Ive logged more hours in this Total War game than any other. It looks great and plays great and is overall super fun.
6313	1	a	Endless hours of reliving and reshaping history for those who are captivated by this time period.
6315	1	a	If you’ve got the time and patience for it, there’s literally hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found in the single-player portion of the game (specifically, World Domination). This is also a game that rewards various play styles and encourages you to try new things, all the while becoming more and more addictive with each hour that passes.
6317	1	a	I have been an avid fan of the Total War franchise since Shogun: Total War way back in the day. Between the Total War franchise and Civilization, I honestly do not know whcih is better. Then Empire Total War came around and alot of people were dissapointed. However, it would seem I am one of the few who doesn't hate on Empire as much as others. The problem I have with Empire is that it gets boring to me real quick. Nothing about this game compells me to play for than an a couple of hours. That isn't to say the game sucks or anyhting, it is just that's appeal isn't as interesting as Rome or even my favorite Total War game, Medieval 2. However, the battles in this game are amazing and can be very intense. I like the musket and cannon combat, but the melee in the game is useless to me. Bottom line, Empire is average at best. I recommend you eithier get Napoleon: Total War for the complete experience or play one of the other Total War games. If you want this game, get it for cheap.
6319	1	a	this game is amazing. the best TOTAL WAR game i have played get this game if you are looking for a fun and challenging rts game
6321	1	a	Great Strategy game with alot of familar mechanics from the total war series, the battles are tactical and with the new naval combat this gives the game a fresh, dynamic feel to it which gives the player a new combat style to overcome tactically. The game are numerous game modes on offer to player, as well as challenging other players in multiplayer matches.  Overall   9/10
6323	1	a	A very good game but has a few week points in the gameplay forinstance the game play is in the players advantage nomatter what difficulty it is at forinstance India should not be able to take on major world powers in europe in the early stages of the game and win plus the AI run enemy are too easy
6325	1	a	One of the Best RTS games out there and is extremely fun to play through the campaign, Darth Mod is also a must for it!
6327	1	a	Totally awesome Strategy game.
6329	1	a	The game was innovative back in time when was released, but full of bugs, CTD's, and crazy AI. Today most bugs are already fixed, and AI is now more stable. I have 588 hours of playing, it is addictive, i can pass all the day playing without get tired or bored. Definetly a must have if you have passion for the History of XVII Century. The Last of the Mohicans, Barry Lyndon, The Sovereign's Servant are some films you would love to reenact while gamming.
6331	1	a	I played Rome: Total War and loved it and wanted to play Empire: Total War and finally was given it by my wife for our anniversay, but she purchased it outside the Steam system. I pplayed it for 0ver 480 hours and had the same problem time and time again...game would stop working and I would loose my saved game at times. I asked people who had the game and they said it was because I got the game outside Steam and Steam didn't provide help or updates for me. I was about ready to stop playing but looked in the forums and found a temporary solution that proved to work for the most part have played 54 hours now somewhat free of this problem. I have Windows Vista for an operating system. I do like the game, but think that some tweeks could be done. Diplomacy really bites sometimes, at the start it isn't bad, but later in the game sledom do you get accepted when you offer anything reasonable...they want the world and offer you nothing. Plus it seems as the game turns against you if you are the powerfull country...I ended up fighting almost all the countries left in the game. But I still like to play it. One thing that would be nice, if you overrun artillery units you should be able to use them in the game.
6333	1	a	one of best up to 4 in mulity player and you can conqor the world 
6335	1	a	If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.
6337	1	a	Action
6339	1	a	I very much like this game and i would recommend it to anyone who loves these kinds of games. my only issue is that they tried to hard to make this into civilization.
6341	1	a	Probably the one of the greatest PC strategy games of all time! 
6343	1	a	Good game for multiplayer battles, but the campaign can be especially frustrating.
662	0	a	this is a pretty good game, but with all games it has its flaws. the unit controls for land battle are a little drepy. they had a good idea with the turn-based rts but did not pull it off right in my eyes. Another problem is the low resolution on the text in the game and with no way to adjust it i find it a little hard to read sometimes. If you were to ask me to rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10 i would give it a 5.
6345	1	a	This is a game that requires an interest in the mechanics to progress it - with literally no story, you have to create your own or sustain yourself with the tactical aspect. I, personally, perform the latter admirably: this game fascinates me as conducting a large scale conflict with as much grace as possible can. If you have a thirst for colonial expansion and a taste for military formations and movements, this is a game for you.
6347	1	a	For those who like 'Total War'-games, but think they haven't had enough gunpowder and cannons in them will like 'Empire: Total War' very much. Politacl and economical aspects of this game are quite good, even if AI is sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and makes most irrational decisions. But for most of the time AI is behaving and makes good opponent or ally. Battles are engaging and tactical. Player have good array of different kinds of strategies that she can use in different scenarios. No two playtroughs are same. If you like turn based and real time strategy games and enjoy warfare of 1700s this game is good catch. It is fun, intense and can put your skill as general and head of the state to test.  p.s. It is cool to be able to deploy finnish hakkapeliittas to battlefield in this game :)
6349	1	a	Hours of gameplay that seems to never end. I love the feel of this game so much
6351	1	a	Built with Polish and Beauty, to near perfection, this monstrous game will keep you sweating deep into the night for many years. Until the next version that is! Empire adds a new era to the list for historic battle gamers, and this one will be sure to please. From the smoky reports of bayonet laden muskets, to cannon fire and many multitudes of factions at your disposal, you really can't go wrong with this game. Add the many DLC, and you have more historic toys in your arsenal.
6353	1	a	It's a fun game don't put battles on hard you will have a bad day. when playing dont trust the polish they are always out to get you.
6355	1	a	This is an intense game revolving around who can mass-produce more formations of pointy stick guys until you can run over the people that ride elephants and camels and shoot guns
6357	1	a	''Rule Britannia!'' ''Britannia rule the waves'' ''Britons never, never, never will be slaves''  Rewrite history, unite the world with Total War!
6359	1	a	Absolutly a stratagy game takes place in the 17th-18th century, definatly realistic with huge armies at your disposal, however, if you are one to stress over your country being wiped out overnight, or so much debt that your people rebel. its probably not for you.
6361	1	a	This is one of the greatest games ever! 
6363	1	a	Id say this game is great. Its my favourite of all the Total War genre. The fact that the economy is so much easier to handle is a great help, manage 50 territories in a minute for tax. Also that hated delay after building something then having to wait soooo long or a large enough population to progress to the next level no longer exits. The research tree is fun as each play through you can decide what you need to research, so as you play as different factions you can customize what bonuses, buildings and units you unlock first to get the edge to win the game.
6365	1	a	This game is the best thing I found to replace Command and Conquer games now that they are not compatible with the newer OS setups, fun to play, easy to learn, but still a decent challenge.
6367	1	a	I like this game, I sometimes don't understand why there is a lot of hate towards this game, I enjoy the locations, battles, graphics and the game frame of this game. On the otherhand there are a few bugs and errors which kind of ruin the game. An example of this would have to be how easily places you have captured will rebel, it is quite annoying to try and get world domination when you have every single area you own trying to rebel against you :/.
6369	1	a	Grand scale total war.............great game for sure
6371	1	a	very good game u should buy it
6373	1	a	great game worth the money
6375	1	a	What differentiates a good game from a great game, is whether you find yourself reinstalling it years later; and despite its flaws, Empire: Total War manages to capture my imagination again and again. If you are a fan of the period, large scale battles filled with musket wielding infantry, cuirassiers, and bronze cannons, or immense wooden ship unleashing devastating broadsides on each other, you owe yourself to try this game. Add a mod like Darthmod, and you get an experience that no other strategy game managed to deliver up to this date. Unfortunately, despite the importance of diplomacy to 18th century politics, and the many factions that appear in Empire: TW, the game still lacks in that department, so if you're interested more in negotiations than in combat, there are better options in the market.
6377	1	a	This is a pretty decent game, if you like real time strategy. The graphics are amazing, if nothing else.
6379	1	a	Really good game!
6381	1	a	Its a good game!
6383	1	a	great game, have spent many hours on this game and really enjoy all aspects of it!
6385	1	a	Great game to play, fun and entertaining!
6387	1	a	Wow what ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 14 $ one day and the next day its 3 bucks what a ripoff good job steam. 
6389	1	a	Empire Total War + Darthmod = You no longer have a life
6391	1	a	Empire is the first total war with multiplayer campaign, however you will need to download the beta on the site, and so to register on the site, thing that it seems you can do again at this address:  http://www.totalwar.com/en_us/empire-multiplayer/  Between empire and napoleon, i prefer campaign on empire, because the periods of time show severals big factions by alliance (and not only france in one of them as in napoleon), and empire is ok for land, but not for sea, because naval gun range make little ships shooting farser than big ones. Prefer napoleon if you want the newest one, as it has less bugs and more improvements, is ok for both land and sea, and has multiplayer campaign this time available, but with problem of save. Sea battles on these games was epic.
6393	1	a	It's better then Civ V.
6395	1	a	Every game of the Total War series captivates me for a long time. They're games for long nights. Nothing beats the satisfaction of placing your armies exactly right, not to kill all your enemies, but to achieve just the necessary strategic victories (or sometimes even defeats) to cut off enemy reinforcements, prevent operations or gain access to new regions. Empire is, in my opinion, the best product of the series - I like the imperialist era, but it's also on a higher technological level than Rome or Medieval.
6397	1	a	Great Game!
6399	1	a	awsome game fun gamplay very addictive. 
6401	1	a	Ive already spent over fifty houra on this and i plan to triple it before i move on to the next campaign option,
6403	1	a	It is Empire Total War on Sale - Need I say more?
6405	1	a	Empire Total War is certainly one of the best games in the total war series. The graphics are astounding and the animations are much improved from medieval II total war. The grand campaign is vast and will take a few weeks to complete, assuming that one were to play consistently for a few hours a day. This game also introduces sea-based battles in real time for the first time ever. It may not seem like much, but the dynamics and the sounds of said sea battles are amazing.
6407	1	a	Empire total war is my Number 1 game of all time, because it brings you into a time of human history were there was a lot of change and devolopement which shaped our modern world as we know it today. Its an amazing historical game were you can learn a lot from and also change the path of history like for example you can prevent the French Revolution or destroy major nations such as Spain or Russia. It's a game were you can experience an empire on such a gobal scale and feel like you're an emperor. It gives you an insite on 18th century warfare were the fighting was done face to face. I always enjoyed playing this game, i've never gotten bored of it, theres always something new or different to experience. I hope you will enjoy this game as much as i do, its a game worth buying even though its 3 years old.
6409	1	a	If you like Strategy gaming this is one of the Best in the Genre.
6411	1	a	really good gamevof this time :)
6413	1	a	Steam is the gayest ♥♥♥♥ing parasitic merchant scum i've ever had the displeasure of encountering.
6415	1	a	A quality change into the Total War franchise.   The standard strategy changes completely, enter technology trees and discover the power of the fortified garrisons. Also, you at last can play naval battles.  Maybe you think that you love massive gory hand to hand medieval battles and that the use of gunpowder perverted the art of war into something boring and dishonorable. After you play this game a few hours you'll discover a new world of positioning, discipline and tactics... not to mention heavy cannon use!  A worthy addition to the Total War saga, and the only one when you can play almost in the whole globe.
6417	1	a	One of the best RTS-TBS hibrids and the 3rd best of the TW series. A very exciting era, still amazing graphics, authentic sounds, a range wide of units, different cultures, enourmous theather and plenty of hours to waste :). The diplomacy is the best, better than in any other TW game.  I think it would be great to have some other playable factions, but it's still fine. If you missed it so far, now you must give it a try. 
6419	1	a	One of the best games in it's category, let alone it's time period. You may not find it completely original, but that's okay because it is extremely fun! And, as a plus, it's the only of it's kind as it takes place in 1700-1799.
6421	1	a	Excellent game, I love replaying it with a different faction over time. DarthMode also modded the game greatly. I know im vintage
6423	1	a	Empire Total War is an interesting member of the Total War series. It has both positive and negative factors, that make it an interesting one to reccomend. On the one hand, it is unmatched in scale, allowing you to explore not only Europe, but the Middle East, India and the Americas as well. It also has unique units for each faction, which is an excellent feature. The downsides are moslty within the gameplay. It can get repetitive pretty fast, and the AI isn't exactly smart. Online play is still in beta, even at this date, so I can't exactly review it. Overall though, one of my favorite Total War titles. 7/10
6425	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. I played campaigns over and over again because of how great this game is.
6427	1	a	This game is great! Many happy hours conquering the world!
6429	1	a	This Game is awesome. It is worth the money because it is really interesting and at sometimes intense. Maybe Emotional a bit,cause im allways ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when one of my generals or my king dies.
6431	1	a	Another great Total War Game involving the British conquest of the United States of American and how they fought back to withold the domination of the USA under British rule.
6433	1	a	this game is a fun but it does have some down sides like i recomend playing this game on a good computer to get the best out of it.
6435	1	a	This game is very fun. I have put so much time into this game and I love every second of it. If you love strategy games you'll LOVE this game.
6437	1	a	really not the best total war but its ok
6439	1	a	If you love the series or just love strategy games, this one is for you!
6441	1	a	Great game!
6443	1	a	hell yeah
6445	1	a	I recommend this game to anyone who likes buggy software.
6447	1	a	Strategy at its finest
6449	1	a	Old But Gold!
6451	1	a	Setting is great, scope is great (the entire ♥♥♥♥ing world), battle AI leaves something to be desired. Can be sort of fixed with user mods.
6453	1	a	Empire Total War is a spectacular game to play. Besed on the 18th century American Revolutionary War.
6455	1	a	IT GETS ME ROCK HARD IN MY ♥♥♥♥♥ 
6457	1	a	
6459	1	a	Of all Total War titles, this one is my favorite, campaign wise at least. Granted there are plenty of bugs and the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I love having such a vast area of the world to fight over. It's a bit like an open world RTS if that makes any sense. You can start an empire anywhere, from America all the way to India that can expand across continents.  I loved sweeping down from the north with the armies of Russia in America, creating a staging area to invade the colonies of the other empires. Cutting right through the natives, slaughtering their armies with cannon and shot. My empire became just that, my empire, not limited by boundaries typical of games similar to this typically empose.  My expansion unlimited, my armies mighty, an entire world just a few short turns away from domination. It's glorious.
6461	1	a	Historical gameplay at its best. Using the expertly designed economy system, improve your empire and build an army to take over the necessary territories to win the game. A straightforward mission, that involves the historicla desires of each player. Secondary campaigns, such as the Road to Independence also illustrate how history drives this game. The map is highly realistic in geography and style, though the water is a little strange (too reflective). The battles are intense and require real strategy. You have to know what your units can do and where to place them, and bringing a larger force to a battle and then pressing auto-resolve is not always a guarantee of success. I have played every campaign, and they are all interesting. The economics are very true to real life. Over-tax the lower class and the population declines from lack of goods and services, over-tax the wealthy and their abilty to generate wealth drops until you can't bring taxes down without going bankrupt. But keeping them up causes rebellion.  True to history and realistic gameplay, much better for those who want a real-life experience and not the AI drive style of the Civilization franchise.
6463	1	a	I have a hard time adapting from quick RTS's like Company of Heroes and Age of Empires to games like this with extremely long drawn out battles, but if that's your thing then this game would suit you.
6465	1	a	Another great addition to the Total War series. I have probably played this title more than any of the others. A strategic and tactical challenge.
6467	1	a	The Best Strategy Game ever!!! (except Civilization IV)
6469	1	a	Really cool Large-Scale rts. The 'controlled chaos' that this game introduces is CRAZY. Beware, however, this game is not for the new rts player. 7/10
6471	1	a	Played this for a while and it's fun. There are some mods for it like Darthmod to make it more challenging due to half bad, half good AI and some diplomatic tweaks. Most changes are consmetic though.   It's fun to play as a great nation from that era and conquer the world, example the Britts vs. French or Swede vs Russians and you can build up empires and change the course of history. The replayability is huge because no campaign is the other alike.   It's worth the full price tag and even more so on sale.
6473	1	a	A game that can be rather hard to get into. Battles can be easy if you know the correct tactics. I love the technologies that are upgradable and can turn the tide of a battle if you have the better equipment. Make allies and enemies at your peril and try to become Emperor of the world. Recomend this to anyone who has loved theTotal War series and who loves a good strategy game!
6475	1	a	Colonial line of faaaanny. The game you need if you've ever felt like shooting and conquering some rebelious americans.
6477	1	a	A great game. You can play for hours on end and get lost in the gameplay.
6479	1	a	A brillian entry to the Total War series. It can get immensly tough towards the end game, and in-battle, but it is rewarding to wipe out the French game after game.
6481	1	a	Not to into RTS's but this game is O.K.
6483	1	a	Empire:Total War, a strategy game released in 2009 [cite] and set in 18th century Europe, India and America is a great start to the Total War series. Good graphics, detailed gameplay, easy (not always) difficulty, makes it good for newcomers. On the other hand, the AI CAN be rather stupid. On and Easy difficulty they will provide little challenge. Also, provided that your computer is slow, it may be a bit laggy. If this was a star rating, I'd give this game a 4.5 out of 5. Not perfect, but definetly a great game.
6485	1	a	While Total War Empire is far from perfect. In fact, one of the reasons you'll probably never play it is becuase of how detailed and time consuming it is just to learn. But it is totally worth your effort if you have any interested in this period of history.  Both the strategy side and the tatical side are well thought out and really get you in the spirit of Enlightenment Colonialism. Nothing says 'Freedom!' quite like watching your cannon fire route a line of infantry.  Once you get into the details it's really worth it. There's also a massive diversity of units, regions to play, minor regions to contend with, types of units, types of regions, religions and buildings. It's one of the least abstract and most directly representational historical stratagy games I've ever played. I can't recommend it highly enough.  Just know if you decide to play the long campaign with one of the larger powers you're in for a massive time commitment.
6487	1	a	Play this game with DarthMod modification for total fun.  Copy and paste -  http://www.moddb.com/mods/darthmod-empire 
6489	1	a	From Europe, To The American Continent, From Europe to Asia. The Armies will march and the world will tremble by the sound of our cannons !
6491	1	a	This game is a large leap from previous titles, but in a good and east-to-learn way. Overall combat works great, perhaps I say better than Rome and Medieval II (HERESY!) , and the economy is easier to build than in previous titles as well (for the better, as you are given three large theatres of combat that you have to finance eventually). The addition of researching technology for military, industry, and philosophy makes competeing against other nations even more fun and challenging to get that edge over them. An amazing experience to those familiar to Total War games, a must have for those who love RTS's, and a great game to learn the Total War series from. Recommended.
6493	1	a	It's in the title really. Rather than focusing on the battles, this game is about Empire-builing. Get Napoleon if you want battles.
6495	1	a	I, Zombie, recommend this game. Never played it so far.
6497	1	a	I would totally recommend this game, and its successor, Napoleon: Total War. These are two of the greatest strategy games I've played, and I've played a ton.  If you're interested in controlling a vast empire, fine-tuning your economy, researching technologies, maneuvering great armies, or fighting immense, real-time battles with thousands of soldiers marching, firing, charging, and dominating, then this game is for you.
6499	1	a	Excellent game, campaign mode a little dull, only if campaign mode came from Europa Universalis and battle mode from this game...
6501	1	a	This game has its glitches but in my opinion it is one of my favorite alltime games 
6503	1	a	its very nice!!
6505	1	a	Be sure to get Darthmod to enhance tha game. But even without its a great game
6507	1	a	if not the best strategic game, then one of the best!!! ;)
6509	1	a	Still my favorite of all the Total War series. Grand Campaign alone is more fun to play than EUIV.
6511	1	a	why do you not have this game yet????????? It is the best strategy game to date in my opinion. Working with historical empires and during the times of the 1700's, you know your in for a treat. The 1700's was a time of war everywhere, especially against Britain and France for the fight for North America. Known as the French and Indian war (from a British/American perspective). This is probably the most amazing time period in the history of time, so many things happened in this time. The French and Indian, the America Revolution, The French Revolution and more than I know probably. This game has great DLC, mods and gameplay in general. If you don't have any of the Total War series in your steam library, you need to re-evaluate your gaming life.
6513	1	a	One of the best RTS games I've ever played. What makes this game unique is that you can't simply select all units and have them bulldoze their way across the map.
6515	1	a	Like this RTS, only it is slow.
6517	1	a	Awesome game. I got it after all the bugs were fixed. Its the first of the series I'd played, and my god was it good/is still good to play now and again. The naval battles are nothing short of epic, and not being a huge gamer before this, the cannons firing right next to you, and exploding right next to you, was an interesting experience, it really puts you into the battle. I've actually learned abit about this time period from this game, and its given me an interest in this time period. I think I've clocked up the most steam hours with this game, although civ 5 might be a bit higher. But anyway, I would definately recommend this amazing game.
6519	1	a	Awesome fgame. good tactical and strategic game. very long. campaign is a littleshort but overall 9/10
665	0	a	The text is ridiculously small and blurry. It makes the game close to unplayable and just very unenjoyable. Waste of money.
6521	1	a	After a rough start and several patchs,this game is quite good and the standard for tactical combat,The campaign map however is laughably poor compared to Paradox's offerings when it comes to grand strategy.Still I recommend this game for its tactical battles and multiplayer.
6523	1	a	love this game
6525	1	a	I can never get enough of this game, although I wish there were more options in deplomacy, this game is great!!
6527	1	a	I am not a huge fan of strategy games but this is great. It has action to it because in games like civ 5 battles are dull bu here you command your troops and tell them what to do. But the naval combat is hard to get used to but the economy is actual really easy.
6529	1	a	Wheather you perfer overpowering a nation to expand your own empire, to aid a nation under seige from an oppreser, or just sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the right time to send in your own forces to fight the unexpecting. This game delivers intense land battles as your line infantry exchange vollies, your artillery sit behind cover and lay waist to all those who pose a threat, and the cavalry lie in wait in the treeline waiting for the right moment to flank an unexpecting unit. Empire Total War is a great game I highly recommend this game.
6531	1	a	This game is great, the gameplay is spot on, and the game's controls are great!
6533	1	a	If your calvalry gets attacked from behind, they won't try to defend themselves, they'll just patiently wait for death to consume them. Your canons will also send grapeshot through your ranks if they're in the way.
6535	1	a	one of the best strategy games ever! 
6537	1	a	Empire: Total War is a really fun strategy game. The AI generally sucks, but that is to be expected of a Total War game. Overall 8/10.
6539	1	a	another great total war game
6541	1	a	Total War series what can I say? Actually was part of a test group when this game was being developed in SF so it was neat to be exposed to art work and game mechanics before the release. Great turn based game. Wish I had more time to thoroughly enjoy all the factions/story lines.
6543	1	a	Empire: Total War™ is a milestone for the Total War series. With great units, a detailed campaign for the great American Revolution, and diplomatic relations that make sense.  This installment in the Total War series is arguably one of the best, next to Napoleon: Total War. It features many different game modes, which are: Campaign, Road to Independence, and Battles (as well as Multiplayer, but only battles may be accessed through this). Campaign is treated like a Civilization game. You pick a nation, and must conquer a certain amount of territories, plus a few required named territories (EX: Britain must capture New France, Georgia, Leeward Islands, Ireland, Gibraltar, Florida, Hindustan, Scotland, and England alone with 25 regions by the end of the year 1750 in a short campaign). In the campaign, you may build numerous buildings such gardens, barracks, markets, fur traders, brothels, etc. You can also build units, and lead them into battle. The battle system in campaign has 3 options. Siege, Assault, and Auto-Resolve (along with retreating). When sieging a city, it will 'starve' a city to where you can take the city over without fighting after a number of turns, depending on it's defenses. The enemy can fend off a siege, though. The assault option takes a more advanced turn on battles, to where you may command your units to fight the enemy units, and manage the battle manually. The auto-resolve option is just what it says, it automatically decides who the winner of the battle will be depending on numbers, technology, and skills of both of the empires. This option is what I usually choose, unless the odds do not look in my favor or the skills look even. In campaign, diplomatic relations also take place. Depending on which nation you are, you may start out with some allies depending on the history of your nation (EX: Spain is with Britain, Great Britain is with United Provinces). Other nations become wary of being your allies if you go to war with your own allies, or break treaties. The longer you have someone as your friend, the harsher the trust falls with other nations. Economy also exists within Empire, and gaining money can be fairly challenging. You may become trading partners with other nations (the best route, just don't declare war on everyone!), you may tax your people highly (not recommended, as the people will revolt to make new nations), and you can always take over other regions (though you will have to exempt them from tax for a few turns to lower the chances of rebellions and strikes).  In the Road to Independence, you are the Thirteen Colonies. You first start by fighting Native Americans, you settle. The campaign then focuses on settling the lands, and defending them from Native Americans. Later on, you have to capture regions from the French in the French and Indian War. This then leads to pushing the actual British out of the lands, claiming Independence. A fairly fun campaign.  In Battles mode, this focuses on battles and battles only (aka 'Assaulting' a city in campaign). You can either customize your own battles, or choose from the historical ones already laid out for you.  Multiplayer for this game features Battles mode, and no campaign. It is fairly fun, but be sure to warm up in campaign first before trying to conquer your friends!  --- ***BUGS***  This game is known for having some AI problems and not a lot of difficulty. This can be fixed by DarthMod, but I never saw the need to use it. Thanks for reading my review!
6545	1	a	This game is absolutely captivating. Stunning graphics, amazing physics, fun and violent gameplay. Hours of your life will be spent glued to this game!
6547	1	a	you all need this game
6549	1	a	Best game ever. So many regions to conquer, so many factions to pick from (Empire total Factions is a must)... and really detailed! This game will never get old! It's by far one of my favorites!
6551	1	a	My Favorite Steam Game
6553	1	a	As with any RTS, it takes some time to get used to if you are not familiar with the total war games, but after finishing the American campaign, I had a solid grasp of the mechanics. The diversity of the units really adds a lot of depth to the game, and the real-time battle mechanics are very well executed. It can get a bit repetetive at times, but on the whole, I really enjoyed the grand campaign. Go team Poland-Lithuania.
6555	1	a	Good wholesome game great tactics very well made great brain game all the cool stuff the previewest ones had endless fun.
668	0	a	This game is bad. Like, really bad. All of the great features that gave the Total War games personality have been removed and leave a very dry battle sim and a very, very broken AI. Naval battles are a joke, the last time I played it people in my own regiment would shoot each other in the back of the head. The game itself was reviewed by everyone as what it could potentially be after a few patches and you know what? Even after years of Patches the game is still not worth anyones time, especially not mine and probably not yours.
6557	1	a	Without the Darth Mod, an excellent game, at times a bit buggy, but I blame Sega pushing a release for the bugs. With the Darth mod, the game feels finished, and for me is the best in the series. Won't compare it to any of the others because they're all a bit different. Buy it, because ruling the world never gets old.
6559	1	a	this game gave me a better idea of what ti was like for my great grandfather when he fought in the korean war. ♥♥♥♥ was brutal, man
6561	1	a	This is One of the best Empire type games that i ever played. I have told my friends about this game and will people about this game.
6563	1	a	I haven't played that much, but it's pretty fun I guess. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys watching colonial soldiers line up in rows and stand there calmly while the enemy shoots at them.   9.9/10 because Austria's a little b**ch!
6565	1	a	GET IT GUYS!!!
6567	1	a	This is a good game. 
6569	1	a	This is one of my favorite games, I like the idea to take over the world (for the most part) and to change history! If you are a strategy fan defenitly try this game out! And yes the battles are amazing.
6571	1	a	I love this game
6573	1	a	Its the best Total war of the series for me thus far. I quite enjoy the mechanics of the game and the challenges it brings. While the naval combat does still leave something to be desired, its ground campaign is very strong as always. The visuals are stunning and its global campaign maps added a new fun level of challenges.
6575	1	a	So... I've played quite a lot of this game, as the hours show.  Empire is by no means a perfect game. It got a lot of flak on release and, even with updates and fixes, it still deserves some of that. But if you're interested in the period, and a Total War fan, I recommend giving it a try. I did, and sorta fell in love with it.
6577	1	a	A great game with continuous replay-ability value. One of the very first games I bought on Steam and I have never regretted it, it now has a firm place as my most favorite game on any platform and within any genre.
6579	1	a	Empire is a awsome game for people who like strategy and old war combat. It has a very large campaign map and the Road to Independance Campaign is very well made. I also like the extra content packs , they make the game expirience even better.
6581	1	a	If you like Civ V but also like Age of Empires, Total War as a series offers the best of both worlds. The overworld campaign is a turn based strategey, but when two units collide to battle, you control the units as the game becomes a real time strategey. No economy to set up in game, what you bring to the fight is what you get to use. There really isn't anything that compares to the Total War expierience, so check it out!
6583	1	a	Great game to waste time on. Despite a certain friends disdain for musket volley's sooo much fun to conquer the world. Has all the fit and polish and to me is the last best Total War. Rome II left me wanting more, but this one was perfect.
6585	1	a	As some total war fans aren't sold on this game, I have spent countless hours playing. The campaign map is MASSIVE and economy/technology research really plays big on the success of your campaign. Although micro-managing all your regions can be tedious at times it keeps you on your toes (as with all total war games). Battles are fun and graphics are getting a little outdated for todays standards but solid none the less. Highly recommend this game if you like managing an empire and making cunning strategic and diplomatic decisions to turn the campaign in your favor and outwit and out muscle your oppenents. 9/10
6587	1	a	decent game although, it was precursor, to far more better complete TW game NTW.
6589	1	a	one of my very favorite games. love the style of strategy this offers.
6591	1	a	Probably the best of the TW series due to the sheer breadth of the concept, Old World, New World and India. Well worth the time to play. Easiest factions are England and Indians. Hardest I've found is the Spanish and Dutch. Once again, only problem is the continual crashing of games every 60 minutes or so. Very frustrating.
6593	1	a	A rippin' good time, this one.
6595	1	a	Epic War Game Time Consuming But Well Worth It.
6597	1	a	One of the best RTS games
6599	1	a	In my Shogun 2 rccommendation, I called this game a failure. I was wrong, what made it a failure in my eyes that I didn't really see at the time was a sucky computer that held the game back.  Now I play it quite regularly, heavily modded with Darthmod. But I did play it unmodded for a long time, and even by itself, it shines.  I love this period in general, and it's combat, the game makes a very good job of pulling it off too. Musket fire, cannon volley's, the smoke filling the air. It can be amazing to watch as your line infantry gun down an approaching melee troop with fire by rank. The diplomacy system in it is also one of the more involved, and on the higher difficulties, the AI is deffinately more competant and demands less stupid things.  Although, despite my beasty machine that I run now, Empire still tanks sometimes on siege battles, apart from that, it runs really smooth, and stable, even when heavily modded.  After more consideration, i'd highly recommend giving this Total War game a try.
6601	1	a	Great game, great product. This is a fun, epic game!
6603	1	a	Amazing game cannot find anything wrong with this game except that I would like to see a better controll screen like Napoleon has
6605	1	a	'Good sir!! Thy revolution hath started!! Gather yer finest ships and blockade the port!!' - The new additions to the TW series. How can't this 17-18th century rts game satisfy you for a decade (more than an average game)? It's got lovely soundtracks, knowledgeable and admirable quotes, in-game naval fights, a wide variaty of units, trade theaters, decentralized cities, a timetable of historic events, more countries and different types of goverment. With this game, you can forge your own empire, and alter history to your liking!! READY........... FIRE!!!
6607	1	a	Add a little class to your games list. Yes You, you know who you are. With a unique take on the RTS genre, you no longer have an army of twenty units fighting war in a two mile box. Because really, why are the Aztecs fighting England in a tiny patch of desert? The whole world is yours to take if your ballsy enough. Or have enough cannons.
6609	1	a	This game is great~ the vinalla is awesome but with Darthmod it's 100X's better i would defently buy it :D
6611	1	a	Very addicting, love the naval battles and the idea of moving troops across the globe to conquer. a bit slow at first, but after 20 years things are much more fast paced and exciting. Not to mention the advancment in technology.
6613	1	a	Great strategy and simulation game.
6615	1	a	All around a really good game, the battles can be a little hardware intense but they are extremely fun. This is a much different type of RTS than Sins starcraft. the only problem I have is that the AI has no idea how to handle walls. My troops would be on top of the walls with gun and I would tell them to attack a unit on the ground and instead of just shooting them they would charge down the wall and sword fight them.
6617	1	a	The game is great but there are several glitches that cause the game to crash and one which prevented my campaign map from working at all. That last glitch affected the save file as well so my entire campaign was lost. Other than that it is a great game.
6619	1	a	One of my all time favorite games, Empire: Total War places you in the early 1700's and invites you to take up the cuase of one of the worlds major powers during that period. Although the AI was unfinished by the developers - particularly the campaign AI - gameplay is still enjoyable and, when on hard, so what challenging. Naval battles are introduced into the Total War franchise for the first time in this game, and all the titles since then have tried to live up to the standard set by Empire. None have even come close yet. If you have played any of the other Total War games then Empire will offer you new challenges as you attempt to manage the sheer size of the campaign map. For new players, welcome to the very best of the franchise so far. Rome 2 isn't a bad effort from CA (the developers), but let's just hope that it is a warm up for Empire 2! Highly reccomend Empire: Total War - 9/10
6621	1	a	Empire: Total War is the finest of the Total War line of games. The breadth and scope of the game is amazing, offering many options for play. Of all of the Total War games that I own (I own them all), Empire is the one to which I continue to return.
671	0	a	Really ♥♥♥♥, Don't buy, Worst game I have Ever Played!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6623	1	a	I have spent a lot of time on this game 10 out of 10
6625	1	a	this is a fun game and there is some fun skrimerish you can do
672	0	a	bugs and issues. Code for getting thegame started is unworkable for the additional disk I have purchased. Not happy
6627	1	a	Everything is awesome, I'm sure that everyone should buy this game. Graphic and battles are amazing.
6629	1	a	best game i ever play   In this game there are swords and guns and horses and spears and elephants this game like a world war every army and state has a special ability   Army Indians that they have units remain hidden even when walking and I love this thing much
6631	1	a	awesome strategy game and easily picked up through a couple of hours of playing
6633	1	a	If you like Total War: Mideivel, you will love this game.
6635	1	a	the is a instant favorite....if your into history based strategy games check this one out highly recogmend it even being played on low graphic settings still worth playing and eventually invest in a new rig to play it gloriously in high or ultra high so you witness even the smallest detail
6637	1	a	Best Strategy Game Ever Best Game Of The Year 2014 And A Pretty Cool Game 
6639	1	a	No matter how repetitive it may seem, the Creative Assembly never fail to amaze. 8/10
6641	1	a	I have been playing this game for 214 hours, and as I'm new to the Total War franchies I can not compare it to the previous games, but, as a game I find that it is extremely addicting, I find myself playing it often, trying new factions, and different ways of playing. Though, I have not been able to fight in sea battles, as I can't quite grasp the technique to winning, so I auto-resolve them. As for land battles, I find them challenging and fun. The campain map is beautiful and well designed. The historical correctness of this game, however, is way off, I have conquered the entire campain map as Great Britain, which historically never happend, but, if that doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter. Ultimately, if you like strategy, and don't mind changing history, then this game is probably going to work for you. I would highly recommend it for anyone.
6643	1	a	Great 4x game. The first 119 hours were pretty great, but the last hour got kinda stale.  Really though, it's satisfying to be Sweden and take over half of Europe with 4 armies. That's just my personal experience though.
6645	1	a	This game is endless! You gonna need a couple of months to try everything. The ground fights are awesome, but why i love this game is for sea fights! You can find here the best sea fights ever. So i propose to get this game for those who like sea fights and for all fans of total war.
673	0	a	I feel as if my troops wanted to die all of the time and the cannons didn't feel like working during battle I'll stick to my Mid-Evil RTS games.
6647	1	a	Do you want to conquer the world as Prussia and kill the French and watch them run with the greatest army ever (true story)? do you want to kill the Russians for no reason? do you want to NOT be able to make people happy? Want to run the world without declaring war on ANYONE? Want to feel like the greatest leader of all time?   The game, in true total war style, is like Civilization and Age of Empires had a kid. The game is not prefect the loading times and turn times are VERY LONG. But the game is very good and is worth Every penny you spend! 
6649	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. The graphics are top notch (sea battles look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed amazing) and the gameplay is great as well.
675	0	a	Unfinished, unpolished, horrible AI. Avoid unless you heavily mod it. I felt cheated, big time.
6651	1	a	Empire: Total war is epic. Easy interface and addicting gameplay, this game does the Total War series proud. Sometimes the troops will be a little wacky but not very often. By wacky I mean, they'll go in some weird direction when you order them to attack sometimes but that's all I've ever came across. Great Game!
6653	1	a	It is a great game with stunning visuals. Far better than Rome 2.
6655	1	a	I have lowered the graphics in the game to Low and have a computer with more than capable power in every form available and still am unable to play the game without a multicoloured screen. Such a good game to have a daft flaw.
6657	1	a	the game is very fun and sometimes challenging, I recommend it
6659	1	a	One of those Arcanum of Steamworks Magic Obscura situations where the game shipped broken and was never actually fixed. Thankfully in both cases people in the community have made patches for free that turn them into great games. Get darthmod for Empire, it's fiddly but is necessary not only because of the vast additional content but because the game mechanics are simply broken without it.
6661	1	a	Best title from CA till thusfar...  Even RTW2 is not tipping this title from the Throne. Vanilla it is somewhat instable, especially with the Turkish faction. I think CA should have learned from the modding community. But improvements like DarthMod will take this game to the next level and brings it to a standard which CA should have delivered it.  Nevertheless the epic scale, time setting, technological advances which are at the base of the design in the first place. The level of detail in government, rule and triggering revolutions, changes the way on which the game game can be played, over and over again.   I would recommend all RTS gamers to just have a go on this complex but satisfying game. 
6663	1	a	The Road to Independence Campaign is pretty fun.
676	0	a	Very Clunky AI and gameplay. Have previous titles from Total War and can say this is a downgrade from previous titles.
6665	1	a	I keep on coming back to this game! Must be for a reason. Also Empire Darthmod is the way to go.
6667	1	a	Great strategy game!! ;)
6669	1	a	best total war game yet
6671	1	a	Good game. Since I bought the game I was hoping for more 'free' DLC?
6673	1	a	great gane realy fun buy this game its the best great ship battles and ground and good campain
6675	1	a	I played the previous game for days in total i recon. And i love the new version its more complicated, more engrossing. Its the strategy game with political, military danger. 10/10
6677	1	a	My computer sucks so Ive been forced to play a dumbed down version of this game and it is still my favorite TW title. That being said I have not had the opportunity to play any TW game released after it. I have enjoyed it so much that I am currently in the process of purchasing the necessary hardware to build a rig that will allow me to play the game as it was meant to be.
6679	1	a	Best total war game to date
6681	1	a	Is very nice, i give it 8/10 rubber dickbutts
6683	1	a	One of the best Total War games in my mind! 
6685	1	a	I'd say play it if you love the gunpowder combat. It had immense potential and nailed many of the goals, but ultimately was a let down for me. That being said I still dump hours into it for the sheer scale of it. With mods it becomes a VERY good game. Worth it if on sale.
6687	1	a	bitt buggy but just realy good
6689	1	a	I recommend it.
6691	1	a	Highly recommended!!!
6693	1	a	Much fun for many hours ruling the world.
6695	1	a	This game is racist
6697	1	a	Medieval Total War II was the king of the strategy genre! Although not quite as good this game still delivers. Definitely worth a play
6699	1	a	a really cool game with cool details and models, but requires a good PC to run.
6701	1	a	Great game
6703	1	a	great game love can't stop playing it for me 9 out of 10
6705	1	a	This game is awsome try it out.
6707	1	a	I have been playing this game for a long time and whit the excepcions of some historical errors For example [In Spain] Charles the II dead in 1700, the uniforms from the officials NEVER were yellow or the flag of Spain is until 1785, the flag of the Spanish Empire (1492-1785) was the flag in the game of 'New Spain' (Cross of Burgundy).Since 1785 the Spanish flag that is in the game is the official. Excluding little errors like those the game is PERFECT.
6709	1	a	Love this game almost as much as Medevil Total War
6711	1	a	Excellent strategy game. The action is real and the graphics are superb.
6713	1	a	Good graphic, good game, but it still lacks for me from the classics like Medieval or Rome. I still love the franchise and its releases.
6715	1	a	you can capture ships. best game period. realistic slave colonialism, so godly. its real as all heck
6717	1	a	This is a brilliant game I must say. The only other game in the TW series I have played previously to this one was Medieval II of which I found very much enjoyable, however 'Empire: Total War' is moderately different but, in my opinion significantly more enjoyable. The campaign features the entire world (excluding the Northern and Southern Ice caps) as oppose to Medieval II which only featured Europe.  This game in the Total War series also featured not only land based conflict, but also sea based conflict of which the player has the ability to command and control.  Ultimately I found this game extremely enjoyable and would recommend this game to anyone, particularly those whom enjoy games within the strategy genre, but even those who don't may even be persuaded to do so by this brilliant game!
6719	1	a	When you decide the fate of a nation. When you make the world yours. When the armies you command slaughter thousands upon thousands of barbaric hordes. When your howitzers fire corrosive lime shells on your enemies, eating away their skin. When you have rewritten history and experienced the rush of war and diplomacy,   then you have played Empire Total War.   P.S Download Darthmod, it makes a great game even better!
6721	1	a	this game is really fun once you get into it
6723	1	a	Empire Total War has, in my opinion, the best gameplay on the campaing map with a solid in depth economical and diplomatic gameplay while keeping the game still easy to play. I also love the era it is set!
6725	1	a	The flaggiest game around!
6727	1	a	Wonderfully crafted
6729	1	a	the best
6731	1	a	1 OF THE BEST STRATEGY GAMES IVR
6733	1	a	Not good.  Rome is better and if you are playing for the setting you should be playing Paradox games.
6735	1	a	This is an awsome game a few bugs but less bugs than napoleon
6737	1	a	Its a pretty good game if your computer can handle it -_-
6739	1	a	If you love battle, strategy games, this is the game for you. Very fun and brain stretching. However, if you're going to play this game, make sure your computer has the system requirements, because mine doesn't and it lags SO badly. Despite the lag, this is the game with the potential to be the best strategy game.
6741	1	a	great game i would say better than napoleon tw because of its whole world aspect and gives you the chance to conquer one theatre or conquer the whole known world from north and parts of south america to the mystical wonders of the east or the noble europe? What will you do with your power?
6743	1	a	This game is amazing, especially with the Darth mod. The ai is fixed, adds a lot of new units, playable states, more agressive combat and a smarter ai. I was searching for immense epic musket battles for a long time, when i stumbled on empire. Many people say it's far too bugged, and that it marks the fall of total war. It is a little buggy, and yes, the engine has changed, but it is still good (and so brutal).
6745	1	a	this game is fun i have no prob with it
6747	1	a	The best historic war game in History
6749	1	a	The worse TW game ever. Broken beyond what any patch can repair. If you want something of this ERA, choose Napoleon TW instead, it is far far far better. CA made the decision not to port to Empire the improvements done in Napoleon in AI.
6751	1	a	The hours you will spend on this game is amazing. Let me put it this way- Nation: Great Britain Objective: World Domination (50 Regions) Hours Spent: Over 130 hours on ONE campaign Reason for campaign not being completed: BLOODY F***ING FRANCE
6753	1	a	I just thought of a great idea! Instead of ending the research and technology at a certain time period. You could instead continue the research to modern day and the future. Allowing this would make this game a whole lot more popular. It could actuallly be able to compete with Civilization too, because Civ.5 has randomly generated maps and the countries don't act like the actual country would in RL. Empire: Total War has a real map with realistic acting nations. The one thing you need to actually start beating Civilization is a larger range of tech/research.
6755	1	a	be United Provinces, make a navy, DOMINATE
680	0	a	Was a good game, stopped starting up, other people had this same problem. Tried alot of methods from the forums, piece of crap.  It feels like this, and Napoleon are two halves of something great, that could have happened but didn't.
6757	1	a	I really enjoy this game, its perfect for those who love to control massive armies.
681	0	a	crap, this game is crap. I am so bored after 6 hours of playing this stupid game over a 3 week period. I had high hopes for this games because of the amazing setting. It had so much potential yet the developers ruined it and created a anti-fun mess of a game that they threw together to make a few bucks.
6759	1	a	Total War is the Best Game with Cool Graphics!
6761	1	a	They're serving vodka in every corner of the globe now. Glory to Mother Russia, comrades. 10/10 absolutely
6763	1	a	One of the best Total War games. Possibly because its the first to bring in naval warfare to the game and because its no longer a melee battle game. Having rifles brings a different and fresh feel for the game. And it makes you rethink all the strategy you knew before.
6765	1	a	Empire: Total War is a game including depth, action, and a healthy dose of enjoyability. Fans of the Total War series and the RTS genre will find much to enjoy in the turn-based main segment and real time battle segment. No longer do the towns of your nation become filled with a variety of buildings, nor do your armies become irredemably damaged with the loss of a single general. The streamlined processes of improving upon your existing constructions and leader recruitment ensure that you do not become overladen with construction projects or mourn the death of your only warlord. The number of agents needed to create a properly functioning nation have been reduced to an assassin/spy, religious figure, and researcher. However, these agents are recruited as before, but generated by buildings affiliated with them, such as entertainment structures, religious centers, and schools. The long awaited naval battle has been added, and, while not perfect, is as exhilirating and epic as a colonial era combat should be. Speaking of combat, the land battles can be titanic engagements with death, gunpowder, and screams galore. However, smaller conflictsd involving only a handful of units can move slowly and be a bore if not sped up. In addition, the early versions of Empire were riddled with bugs that ruined gameplay, specifically in land battles, but that have mostly been patched out. The diplomacy function, while enjoyable as each nations has expressly different goals, can be annoying as on easier funtions the rival nations can be push-overs while being unrepentant, unforgiving warmongers on harder functions. These issues make Medium difficulty the most appropriately functioning setting. Empire may not be a perfect game, and it does have some noticeable flaws even as most problems have been patched out, it still ranks as one of the greatest in the RTS genre, and as one of TW's finest creations. 9/10
6767	1	a	Empire: Total War is probably my favorite game ever. You can play as many different countries with unique units and strategies. The research is worth doing and can be improved to give your country an edge. The maps are huge and you can play a large portion of the world (the provinces are huge though) which requires protecting trade routes and forging alliances. Overall great game with no bugs that I have ever seen.
6769	1	a	It might not be as clean or polished as Rome: Total War or Medieval 2: Total War, but Empire: Total War is nonetheless a pretty fun game. The campaign map is expansive, the playable factions are unique in their own ways and lend themselves to different strategies, and there's plenty of replay value. I have a couple of gripes with this game, some of which do affect gameplay. Firstly, the enemy AI can be quite dumb at times, even on higher difficulty settings, so the DarthMod add-on is absolutely necessary if you want to play a more challenging campaign. Secondly, the battle map designs are a little too bland for my tastes. I absolutely loved the beautiful and varied map designs in Medieval 2, so Empire felt a little bit like a step back for me in this regard. Lastly, the Road to Independence, a special four-part tutorial campaign, felt pretty stale and overly-scripted until I reached the fourth part, which actually allows you to experience the Grand Campaign in all its glory as the newly-formed United States. Despite these flaws, I generally enjoyed this Total War installment and would recommend it to any strategy gamer. Be sure to patch your game and install DarthMod for the best gameplay experience.
6771	1	a	By far the most underrated Total War game.
6773	1	a	Ive played this game a few years back when the total war complte pack was 75% off and i have played a lot of the game which i find very enjoyable though despite winning in numbers leading a battle yourself can do much better than what the AI/game predicts, Also the other AI nations are unwilling to trade fairly meaning you have to trade 3/4 technologies for just one technology of theirs or have to pay 1000s of ingame gold just to make a trade, ]  Overall a very great game which is great fun to play though does not feel compelling to play after conqouring the whole world in each thetre of war, north america, europe and india aswell as a few sea trading areas.
6775	1	a	should have been studying for my finals instead 10/10
6777	1	a	great game spent hours playing this
6779	1	a	This is a great RTS game!
6781	1	a	Empire Total War (ETW) takes place during the 1700s in the time of muskets, cannons, and ships of the high seas. I have played most of the previous Total War titles and expansions (Medieval 2 Total War, Rome Total War, Medieval Total War) and have liked them all. While each one has its own positives, ETW might be the most exciting.  The biggest difference in ETW is the wide scale use of firearms as the primary weapon. We got a taste of this with the Spanish in the Americas campaign in Medieval 2 Total War - Kingdoms Expansion Pack. But, ETW is all about getting your lines of infantry formed up and firing at the enemy. I found it very satisfying watching the volleys exchanged back and forth especially in large battles. The other game changer is the cannon. The cannon is now reasonably accurate and especially when fired with canister shot a deadly weapon. Battles will be settled by properly locating and applying your cannons.  If musket balls and cannon shot isn't enough, ETW offers many other upgrades and changes. One of the most desired upgrades is the addition of player controlled naval battles. You no longer have to auto resolve your naval battles. There may be better naval battle simulations out there, but I found ETW to be excellent. The ship graphics and animations during combat are top notch. The other games I have played that have naval combat (Patrician 3 and Port Royale 2) are primarily trade simulators.  ETW also has what I would call a scenario campaign (The Road to Independence). It allows you to play through the establishment of the American colonies and their independence from the British. The campaign follows a storyline and is more restrictive than the typical grand campaign, but I still found it enjoyable. Basically you complete specific mission objectives to continue forward. This scenario campaign is also a good tutorial before hammering it out in the grand campaign.  Another big change is the introduction of technology researching. Certain technologies are required to build certain buildings or upgrades. Technologies also include new forms of cannon ammunition, troop formations (square for infantry, wedge and diamond for cavalry), advancements in bayonets. Of course building upgrades will enable more and more powerful types of troops. You can also research social reforms which improve research capabilities and financial advancements. However, you also have to consider the impact of all these reforms. The populous may also seek revolution in the government. You can seek to embrace this change and lead the new government or fight it and either repress the revolt or be crushed by it.  ETW has also become global. You now have access to more than Europe and the Mediterranean. You can fight in the Americas and India. You can also setup trade depots along the coast of Brazil, Ivory Coast, Straits of Madagascar, and the East Indies to boost your trade income. You will find trade and diplomacy essential in the grand campaigns. Diplomacy will be key whether you need to increase your income with trade, swap technologies to get ahead, or develop alliances to support you against aggressive neighbors.  There are many other differences some more subtle than others that make ETW a slightly different experience.  *Non combat characters are back, but they generate themselves (instead of being recruited) based on the number of relevant buildings that you have.  *A new Gentleman character type has been introduced which can improve research capabilities or used to duel with spies or other gentlemen.  *Armies now have a zone of influence where they can intercept a passing army or let them pass instead of automatically halting the enemy.  *Armies with a general can now recruit additional units or reinforce damaged units while out in the field.  *A region now has towns other than the regional capital where buildings or resources can be exploited. However, these are now vulnerable to raids by your enemies. They can be repaired, but at a cost.  *Trade routes can also be raided instead of blockading to bring extra income.  *Generals/Admirals can be promoted in the field (at a cost)  *Armies that have been stationary for a turn can deploy defenses if attacked.  *Tax rates for Individual regions cannot be controlled (except by exempting the region from tax)  *Not all regions can have the same building options. This doesn't seem to be controllable like in Medieval 2 Total War.  I tried multiplayer for the first time in Total War. It is easy to get into a battle and there are still players to connect with. You can customize your army and there is online ranking system. Online battles are intense, but I prefer the single player campaigns.  Works with Windows 7. However, I have experienced game crashes which occurred during battles. I also had a campaign (with Prussians) freeze up which I had to abandon. I was able to complete another short campaign with Spain. 
6783	1	a	I love the game and spent 117 hours playing it but for some reason it wont open. I rlly want to continue my world domination but i cant do that when me game wont open! So please help me with this problem. Many thanks and plz help.
6785	1	a	Positives: Huge map, exciting era of human history, and lots of factions to battle and choose from (especially with mods). For a fun campaign, I highly recommend America with the Elite Units packs. Great Britain is also very fun in the Grand Campaign. For the most challenging campaign, I recommend the Ottoman Empire (since there are multiple factors working against you).  Improves: ETW had a coop multiplayer in beta mode, but it fell short when they did not stick with allowing players to battle against the computer (every battle was pvp); this was the biggest downside overall. Also, sometimes the CPU will make extremely stupid tactical and strategic decisions during the game (i.e. a very weak country will declare war on your powerful one, or have their general literally walk up to your front line during a battle to get shot to pieces).  Beyond the small improves, if you're into the colonial era, I highly recommend this game.
6787	1	a	great game must have for any total war fan
6789	1	a	awesome, the whole game works together to challenge you as a leader of the great powers of Europe. It allows you to go political, militry or economically focused and is well rounded on each path. Everything about this game is well made and although it is a bit slow if you haven't got a fast computer, it is still awesome to play. It makes you wonder what the new total war games are going to look like after this.  8.75/10
6791	1	a	40,000 English VS 100 French....french won 10/10
6793	1	a	The only problem with the game is that it does not have every single continent. Otherwise a very good strategy game.
6795	1	a	This is an outstanding game. Lacks some factions, continents and useful technologies, but, in all, it's a great game worth of spending many hours playing. Goes better with the Darthmod pack, but without it, it can still be played with some pleasure. **Some**.
6797	1	a	Similar to other games from the Total War series Empire is a good strategy game for those who like early european history. There are some excellent aspects such as what your country's exports. I still like the Rome TW games better, but thats just me
6799	1	a	Ok if you are just getting into the total war games, this is the game to start with.
6801	1	a	best of the best!
6803	1	a	great game
6805	1	a	It is an amazing strategy game, and one of my favourite RTS games!  8/10 worth buying
6807	1	a	Even though it's buggy and unoptimized it's still pretty fun. Thanks to Creative Assembly's awesome QA process the game was basically unplayable for the first 6 months of it's release but it's now...playable at least.
6809	1	a	Very enjoyable game but it would be funner if you could please reopen the multiplayer
6811	1	a	I have a lot of time in this game.... the only reason I stopped is because Total War rome 2 came out. But I'm sure i'll be back. Really great game and time bandit.
6813	1	a	Excellent introduction to gunfire in the Total War series! Yes, the AI can be wierd some times, but not as wierd as the newer Rome 2....
6815	1	a	To the person who said 'This game is Civilization for grown-ups', you almost got it right.  In reality, this game is Civilization for people who enjoy deeper combat. While playing this game you'll find the resource gathering and strategic land grabbing to be the flying buttress to the combat cathedral. I call it that because as strategy games go, Empire Total War has no rival.   The combat is engaging and immersive. You have two forms as well, naval and land. As you develop more technologies and research more manuvers, the game only gets better.   The only cons are the lack of control over resources and the annoying movement cinematics you can't seem to disable.  The aesthetics are quite beautiful. The classical music soundtrack with gregorian monks set a nice stage for a bloody interlude.   Overall: buy it!
6817	1	a	Love this game EVERYONE GET IT AND INSTALL IT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!
6819	1	a	The most underappreciated chapter in the Total War franchise. The inclusion of regular gunpowder troops changes the field of battle radically from previous games, but at the same time opens up a whole new avenue of tactics and strategy. Definitely worth playing, and did I mention you can conquer India?
6821	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Its very realistic and takes lots of strategy to play. However in single-player I wish they had land trade routes, not just sea trade routes.
6823	1	a	Whilst this game is becoming outdated, it still has the base building, killem' attraction. It provides endless opportunities for players to enhance their strategy skills by using multiple countries armies and units.
6825	1	a	from raiding trade routes to launching attacks with thousands of men. whats not to love?
6827	1	a	I love the game although I played Napoleon more than Empire
6829	1	a	Empire Total War is a really fun game and for the price, absolutely worth it. There is tons of replay value and multiplayer matches are still going on. If you're familiar with the Total War franchise I think you'll definitely like it. If you are someone who enjoys strategy games especially ones with a 3D RTS aspect, you'll fall in love with this game.
6831	1	a	like all total war games its the best
6833	1	a	If you like to conquer the world in a dramatic 17th century time period. This is a game for you!
6835	1	a	If you want to be hero i recommend you to play this game, You can change the course of American when playing independent.
6837	1	a	one of the best games ive ever played as it made me think tactics and things are always changing  ive have a good miltary mind and one thing i liked was that the pirates had their own bases and their navys were just as big a threat as the other countrys
6839	1	a	Pick a nation and fight for your lifes
6841	1	a	MANY hours of entertainment for the strategy and history fans although not as in depth as paradox titles still delivered on the replayability.
6843	1	a	I think this game is awesome. there is nothing else to be said.
6845	1	a	Very realistic and exciting strategy game.
6847	1	a	Awesome game that i have sunk 100 plus hrs into. I highly recommend it
6849	1	a	best total war game ever
683	0	a	I didn't like the direction the franchise went in. Feel like Rome Total War and Medieval were better games, and worked better with how the game was designed and evolved. I think a lot of these RTS games that gunpowder eventually harms the series more than it helps. Age of Empires suffered the same fate.   Not a bad game by any means, but its a system hog and really not worth it. Better off playing Medieval Total War, or Rome, or Shogun.
6851	1	a	Amazing game, like the others in the Total War series.
6853	1	a	A game where you get to do what politicians do for a living, engage in trade, steal others' research, then start wars over various differences between your countries (read as empires)
6855	1	a	its pretty fun
6857	1	a	good historical game i learned a lot from this and actually it helped me pass a History exam so unless you notice the historical things and real information really well then that just adds to the plus of this game. The base game is good you can try the mods if you want but its up too you. I can't really tell you more cause it's really a different experience for everyone its like RTS and Tropico i guess mixed its mostly about war than managing your economy but both play a big aspect.
6859	1	a	This game is fun 
6861	1	a	While this is a alpha-version of Napoleon Total War, I would certainly reccommend getting this if it is on sale. The replay ability! Woah.
6863	1	a	Great game buy it. That is pretty much all that needs to be said about this game.
6865	1	a	Empire total war make a good decision of planing game i loved that history of war preiod.
6867	1	a	one of the best tactical games i have ever played
6869	1	a	LOVE IT ! I love to be a centrle eueropen power
6871	1	a	This is probably my favorite of the Total War series. This one or Shogun! Everything about this version feels very polished!
6873	1	a	I love the total war series. This has been the best for me. But it will not open a second time. I have windows 8. Can someone help me out?
6875	1	a	Maybe one day they'll fix the Ottoman Turn Lag glitch, and this game will be playable. But years after release and still no fix, I'll assume they aren't even trying.
6877	1	a	Not a game for the soft headed but definitly a master piece in the Genre of RTS games
6879	1	a	This is a great turnbased strategy, it was put together perfectly. I've been lost in this game. If world domination is what you crave, you'll love Empire: Total War,   9.5/10
684	0	a	Great game (Always loved the Total War series) , spoiled by the fact it crashes non stop. I think I've played 82 minutes in total, all today, and it's crashed within 5 minutes, every time. I'm an IT specialist and a veteran gamer of 30 years (Wow, I'm old), so I know all the tricks and hacks to get games to run smooth.  This game is broken. 
6881	1	a	Best game ever including the DLC
6883	1	a	One of the best total war games, in my opinion. The battles are quite interesting, especially when you get howitzers. The campaign map can get a little tedious, but overall it is a fun game
685	0	a	This was the first Total War game that I ever played and at the time I got it I loved it. Don't be fooled by my hours. 300 of those was by accident when I left it running. The fighting mechanics are horrible and The Creative Assembly just tried to put too much into one game. It's fun to play, but in reality, the gameplay is poop. P.S. the music is horrible which all know music makes the game.
6885	1	a	love this game ♥♥♥♥ing hate steam
6887	1	a	I restored Sweden's Empire and beat the hell out of Russia. Carolus Rex would be proud :D
6889	1	a	you need to know history for bthis game 
6891	1	a	Loved the game. Best being the British and crushing the enemy with the redcoats.
6893	1	a	This is the best in the series. Created an Indian Empire in Britain and America and also took over India and South America as Poland. 10/10  Pros: - Campaign is brialliant, expansive and can be done numerous times without getting dull - Troops are fairly varied, especially with the DLC which is farily cheap - Graphics are great - I personally enjoy having the industry spread over the region and not controlled in the main town - Huge step up in building and recruitment ease from previous editions - All other pros you associate with a Total War  Cons - Potentially the industry being spread makes it hard to manage - some nations have more troop types than others but minor issue
6895	1	a	I conquered all of Europe and India as Poland. 10/10
6897	1	a	Nice game.
686	0	a	Doesn't seem to work for me. I use Linux.
6899	1	a	Complex, rich, addictive strategic game. Great mix of turn and real time strategy, now even multiplatform. Take it, you won't be disappointed.
6901	1	a	First things first this game is fantastic, the grand campaign is amazing and the diplomacy is experianced and beast.  11/10 would get as a random accidental gift from a lithuanian!!!
6903	1	a	Very nice, strategic game. Full of rich graphics and can be played to hearts desire. Nice historical facts and events are pretty accurate. Great game, well worth the money
6905	1	a	
6907	1	a	A brilliant game, a brilliant concept, a lot of fun, until of course the renowned crashes come along. I have over 10 campaigns on this game but then it comes to the one where I have taken all of Europe and half of America in only 60 years as Britain then it corrupts the file! Brilliant game ruined by some bad programmers.
6909	1	a	Co-op campaign say goodbye to three months.
6911	1	a	Empire Total War is the most epic game ever, especially with darthmod, plan to try imperial splendour mod soon. Napoleon Total war a close second. I play these games and only these. My thanks to the creators and techs who made it all possible, the game is worth every penny!! Empire is Epic!!!!!
6913	1	a	Just another aweomse total war...really wish they'd do a ww1/ww2
6915	1	a	im bab aat the game but i love it i had so much fun in mitiplayer.
6917	1	a	An awesome mix of Turn-Based Strategy and RTS mixed into one. Very awesome game!
6919	1	a	Look at how many hours I've played. That pretty much says it all. Gameplay is great, ranging from very easy to insanely difficult depending on your difficulty setting. Graphics still are great even in 2015. I would highly recommend this game if you like Risk or want to conquer the world in a game. It's a shame they don't have plans to make an Empire 2 because this is by far the most fun game in my opinion. The other Total War games are region-based and in my opinion that doesn't hold water to conquering the world. At $20, this game is worth every penny and then some.
6921	1	a	Very awesome, very buggy Total War experience. If you are a fan of the time period, you'll love the game, but if you aren't as picky, Shogun 2 is a much better overall game.
6923	1	a	Very good game if you are into Strategy. A few minor bugs, but nothing to get huffy about. Very good graphics as well.
6925	1	a	this game is great on my computer are bad but runs beutifly think of this as napoleon but 3X better (my graphics are bad beacuse i have a windows 7 with a duel core procceser) you can conquer the world as russia ottemens americans(beat road of independence campaign) martha confedrecy and you can change goverments to
6927	1	a	Played as France, took over England, Ireland, and Scotland, and America rises and asks me to recognize them as an independant nation. I love this game!   BUY IT FOR DARTH MOD!!!!
6929	1	a	i shot and bayonette'd indians and british.   9/11
6931	1	a	An AMAZING Total War game. Battles are very fun to play through, and there are many excellent campaign features. All around, extremely fun. In 27 hours, I've completed the Road to Independence campaign, and just started a Grand Campaign.
687	0	a	You spend more time looking at loading screens and waiting for AI to make its turn, than acxtually play the game... which mostly consist of making endless province improvements.
688	0	a	i cant get it to start 
6933	1	a	It's fun. cool graphics and all but when the elephant unit walks from far distance, it's bad.
689	0	a	The game has some serious bug-issues. Pathfinding is broken, diplomacy makes no sense, units stutter their actions for no reason, turns take ages to skip thanks to the game-breaking 'Ottomans bug' that was NEVER fixed. You basically rely on mods, forums and research to play this game in a semi-stable condition (with emphasis on 'semi'). This game is seriously broken.  The graphics are good, but animations and level design are sub-par at least. Cavarly fights are disgustingly bad animated, as an example.  AI is poor to say the least. But being honest, AI is completly undeveloped.   It makes me sad for two things: first, I don't like throwing away my money. Second, the developers probably saw potential in this idea, but then they took a gigantic dump into it, put a few naval battles and released it. To this day, the game looks like a BETA.  If you value your money, your time and your sanity, don't buy it. If you want to try it on a discount, GET MODS (darthmod kinda fixes the game, kinda). If you still wanna buy it for some reason at full price, well... enjoy throwing your money. Seriously this game is a huge dissapointment. Do not buy.   4/10 in vanilla. 6/10 with mods.
6935	1	a	The Cockney badger approves
6937	1	a	Great game, but there is one major problem - insanely long load times. At first, I thought it might be my computer (it wasn't), so I lowered the settings but weirdly that made them even longer.  Beyond that, I think it is the last truely great Total War game.
6939	1	a	Love the game. Wish it had mod support BUT this game is from 2009 so it makes sense why it doesnt. After 400 hours of playing this game I still love it
6941	1	a	Excellent representation of 18th century warfare and tactics. The graphics are way above average. The diplomacy and religious aspects are intriguing and can be both a blessing and a bane. The navial battles are as historically and mechanically accurate and well integrated with the land units. The spies and religious chacaters are unique and should be used extensively.  As a world history major, the research involved was immense and very well done.  Over all a good game... Play the tutorials first... maybe a few times. Beginners would be well to start with the English first and then experiment with others.  You will lose hours in play...  5 stars.
6943	1	a	I played this game a lot on my dads account, it was great so I got it for my account. It is worth the money if you have an average computer, it is really worth the money if you have a great computer.
6945	1	a	Play As Britain Become A Superpower Country and more Glorius Than British Empire   And Ruled almost all land in India   
6947	1	a	Truly enjoyed this game! Probably the greatest Total War game of the series.. Trust me that you will love the game if you're deciding to buy it. At least in this game you kind of have option how to rule your country and plan what you might do. Honestly, Total War do make great games but this one takes the cake!  A+++++++
6949	1	a	at first i was kind of stuck, i didnt know what to do even tho i did the tutoriul. i had ione of my freinds help me out and i began to play alot more, i love the game now and i am a master. although i do play on darthmod for campains (because its stupid with out it) if you liked napoleon, shogun 2 fots you would love this one amazing game! :)
6951	1	a	Three words: Empire total war 20/10
6953	1	a	Step 1: Get This Game Step 2: Get all the DLCs Step 3: Install DarthMod Step 4: Enjoy!  10/10 Would counquer India again with Poland  
6955	1	a	Very good, but the constant use of musketmen just gets boring, a battle just consists of watching one side shoot the other till they all die.... yea.... naval battles are cool but the ships are hard to control in large fleets.
6957	1	a	very fun game, very well done, NOTE on easy just train cannons,howiters and rilfes and gg you win  best game in the seris from the 3 i have, i love it because the artillery has infinite ammo, giving some importance in killing enemy atillery
6959	1	a	You have to download DarthMod and Causa belli in order to make this game's FUN AND ENJOYABLE
691	0	a	Worst total war game EVER!
6961	1	a	I will admit, when I first bought this game I was very iffy about it, but it introduced me to my highest played series on steam. Empire: was probably the best installment this far for me, holding above 500hours of play time. To put that in perspective, when I bought it, the game was about 30$. That's about 17 hours per dollar paid, and I still launch it up from time to time.  From suicidal victories to overwhelming defeats, the game has never failed to give me a good time. I will however recommend you never use the auto-resolve button, as scenarios that you can entirely murder your opponent, often turn into a percent of your troops lost needlessly.  The game gives you control of what you want, in the campaign, more in depth players can control building, taxes, revolts etc. Less in-depth players can just move around the map and fight wars, making it a near perfect fit for everyone.  10/10 Money well spent
6963	1	a	All's Fair in Love and War, and this is a grand War indeed with ongoing Tactics and Enemies apon Enemy apon Enemy. it will take time a lot og time every now and then, but I give it four arrows to the heart with one broken walking stick.   Moxn
6965	1	a	gret gamed play it 10/10
6967	1	a	-=TOTAL WAR=- - Wanna have a game that you can play like one year? TOTAL WAR - Wanna see fighting and blood and have all countrys in the world? TOTAL WAR - Wanna play with your home country? TOTAL WAR
6969	1	a	Became Britan then stopped the American Revolution and urged the world into the anime of Code Geass ALL HEIL BRITANNIA! -10/4
6971	1	a	A bit of a memory &amp; CPU hog, but one of the greats of the TW series.
6973	1	a	It's an incredible game, with fantastic gameplay.
6975	1	a	An Amazing game One Of the best Total war games so far. a great job by the devs at the creative assembly. 10/10
6977	1	a	Incredible in-depth game. Everything you could want in a colonial-era game and as it's total war, you know it's good! Napoleon: Total war provides the small improvements to things such as diplomacy and battle effects to make it a near perfect game in my opinion.   Just look at my gaming hours, that'll tell you more than any long winded review will!
693	0	a	Want to play a total war game? Get Rome II.
6979	1	a	Amazing game, very close to the first Rome as my favourite TW game.
6981	1	a	This was probably the last time I still had expectations in the lead up to a TW game. Having played Rome, Shogun, Both Medieval games I was used to the TW style. I loved the time period and Sea battles, building fleets was so much fun and the Battles looked amazing. Overall a 7/10 game that provided a fair few good hours of gameplay for me. The last time I can remember that a TW game wasn't just a reskinned copy of a previous game (Napoleon) or a DLC dominated cash cow.  
6983	1	a	Has more countries and units as napoleon total war, but napoleon total war has way better combat. DONT BUY NAPOLEON THOUGH because empire has a mod called darth mod witch adds a ton more units, enhances the graphics, more playable countries, and fixed almost all of the bugs i saw. just added a bit more lag.
6985	1	a	First off GREAT GAME. Secondly.... let me tell ya a lil sumthin... Usually when you play the Maratha Confederacy will take out the Mughal Empire in India fairly quickly.. However in my latest campaign, i was Prussia and watched in horror as the game did so many unexpected things.. Austria moved far more west than it normally does and took out France really early. Bavaria moved in and took out Hannover and the United Provinces.. I go to look at what is going on in India and Maratha has expanded about 3-4 more cities into the Mughal Empire. about 10 turns later i look and the Mughal pushed them back to the original two they start with. and about 20 turns after that, the Mughal Empire has completely killed the Maratha Confederacy, and took over all of the middle east and is now taking on the Ottoman Empire and kicking ♥♥♥. Oh and by now i took over Sweden, Denmark, Polish-Lithuania, Courland, and Russia. Bavaria is still a decent sized Empire and Austria lost its hold on Paris and France is back in the game... the United Provinces got back in but was shortly taken back out by Bavaria.... Definitely surprising. Playability is GREAT!
6987	1	a	Brilliant game, the depth exceeds the previous Total War titles by leaps abound. The somewhat cartoony approach to history that the older games featured has been done away with for a much more serious feel, and it's pulled off very well; even if it isn't perfectly historically accurate, compared to previous games it is apples and oranges. This is not only by far the best Total War game to date, it may very well be the best strategy game in recent years. Yes, the game was released with bugs, but I don't feel that the game itself can be rated based on bug issues. Some people are giving it low scores because they are frustrated with bugs, but I prefer to rate based on content. It might be worth waiting a month or two past release, but the fact is that it runs more than playably for most people, and the bugs will get ironed out. Also, for other people, please stop rating games based on their performance.
6989	1	a	Possibly my favorite video game of all time. Insanely addicting if you like historical types of games.
6991	1	a	This game in mediocre
6993	1	a	put empire at war, sid mires civilzation and you get this. I may be a noob and lose every combat but this is encrebly FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN. You get to charge and get massivly killed. this was not a wast of my money.
6995	1	a	In this game, as the Ottomans, I did the one thing both Napoleon and Hitler cound not do.   I CONQUERED RUSSIA.  
6997	1	a	Me play. Me like.
6999	1	a	1800th century combat with all its pros and cons. Campain AI is ok but there are some stupidity there to get annoyed with (failing to form up piles of soldiers in one army). Battle AI is lacking during sieges and during battles. Increased difficulties means more morale for the AI. A few mods increases the playablilty somewhat but the sometimes odd AI behaviour still is there (unmoddable). The steam rolling effect comes into play during mid/late game which means you dont have to command the battles yourself. You will win anyway. Multiplayer hasnt been tested yet.
7001	1	a	Best Strategy Game Evar. If you want increased unit sizes you can get darthmod which can give you battles of up to 10000 with the right circumstances and when people said this was buggy as hell CA fixed it at a later patch. This is one of the few games that offer 18th century warfare. Seriosly it must have tooken alot of courage to march in that front line.There is even campaign!!! on my game list it is rated as a 10/10 although they could've released multiplayer campaign now that it is so old
7003	1	a	cool game but customer service never got back to me about my problem.
7005	1	a	Sort of like Napoleon. Except with WAY Too many factions, HUGE AMONG OF HUGE MAP. Amurica :3. Did I mention Murica? :3? Oh and of Murica too? :3.  Way among of amazing. Im writing this during the steam sale which is making it 5 dollars. GET IT DURING THE SALE!!!!!!!!!! Good deal for 5 bucks!
7007	1	a	Great game. Buy it you worthless ♥♥♥♥.
7009	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!! I love this game sooooo much i've spent (at the moment) 50+ hours on the game and whenever i get on my computer this is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of something to play.
7011	1	a	Have played this game for hours an hours an love it. I continue to come back to this game. I have bought some of the additional DLC units which does increase fun but not a must.
695	0	a	.
7013	1	a	did british vs americans. I made my british forces make a defenceive line and hold their positions as the americans charged towars me. I destroyed them without moving my men forwards. GG
7015	1	a	One of the best in the series, in my opinion.
696	0	a	Just played 3 minutes of this game and had to quit. if youre using a computer or laptop with graphics cards and os that cam out after this game was made for some reason you can not chose high settings. youre stuck with medium or low settings which dont make sense. im sure its a fun game but not when all your units are pixelized shaddows lol
697	0	a	i loved this game when i was a kid but the game is broke get eu4 its way more realistic the only thing going for empire is the battles and napolion is better dont buy this game get eu4
7017	1	a	Every man has a stick and they poke each other with this stick. you control these stick pokey men with the goal of poking as many of the other men as possable. sometimes they dont even need to poke them with the stick! they just lift it up and yell 'BANG!' and its like they were poked with the stick!  Some men ride on cars, but they have legs for some reason. while they do that they have a shiny stick that they also try to poke others with.  then there are these things that are labeled 'abillery' or something. I dont like them. you cant poke other people with them. they just make an even louder 'BANG' noise and shoot a black fisbee that doesnt seem to go anywhere. and even if it does land in the enemies place they all just seem to enjoy a slumber party afterward.   all in all, I like it. its a great stick poking simulator. I had no idea it was a real thing!  8/10 would poke again!
7019	1	a	Hey, how about a 2012 update, huh? I'm shocked at coming on Steam to see such low scores for a game I've owned for a long time now, that I adore. There is NO bugs, some of these reviews are absolutely outdated and unreliable. In my opinion, this is the most playable of all the Total War games. The tech branches are much more expansive and really do progress as time goes on and the campaign was fantastic. I felt like I was rewriting my text books. It's also one of the more colorful TW games, because it covers such an active century of domination and war. Napoleon felt sort of like a plus 20 year map pack to this gem. This game is just as good as any other TW game, it really is a shame that people wrote hundreds and hundreds of reviews within the first couple of months of the games release, yet when the game is 'Fixed' (Because I never played it when it was supposedly bugged) everyone just lose interest in lifting a finger for a new review. I'll simply put it this way, this game is worth every dollar, pound, or euro it costs.
7021	1	a	Your World Domination simulator
7023	1	a	I enjoyed playing as Prussia in the world domination play thru. lot of different kinds of soldiers tho choose from, when i bought it in 2009 it had so many bugs, a few years and patches {as well as a new computer}later perfect in my eyes Enjoy!!!!
7025	1	a	my game stops working once you reach episode 3 but i love it LOVE the game
7027	1	a	
7029	1	a	Good game, a bit difficult
7031	1	a	i have played this game for over 1400 hours !!! i think thats says it all :)
7033	1	a	great game so vast you can take your time and enjoy the whole experence highly reccomended best game of the total war franchise so far
7035	1	a	&gt;New campaign as Russia &gt;Its a bad country, everyone is poor, at war with surrounding countries &gt;Sweden has a bigger army than Russia &gt;Decide to change Russia &gt;Invade Crimea, Georgia and Chechnya &gt;Putin did this &gt;I'm Putin &gt;Flash foreward &gt;Invade Sweden &gt;Win Swedish capital &gt;Make peace with Swedes &gt;Invade Poland-Lithuania &gt;Win game  Putin/10 would Russia again
7037	1	a	One of my favourite Total War games. My only complaint is that there are too few playable nations. It would have been nice to be able to play as, say, the Mughal Empire or one of the many minor nations in Europe.
7039	1	a	If you like building empires and fighting battles in real time then this is the game for it. The battles can easily be decided by something as simple as a single unit routing in battle, and battles can change on a dime making battles very tatically demanding on land or sea. Personally I enjoy land battles much more than sea battles despite the big explosions, this is mainly due to the fact it is easier to avouid friendly fire and is less confusing.
7041	1	a	Fun stratagy game where you can rewrite history.  Experienced few bugs dispite being on a mac.
7043	1	a	Great game.  This was the first Grand Strategy game that I ever played and it was the game that introduced me to the genre of Grand Strategy games. Loved it when I started playing it and still love it. I will continue to return to this game to restore the Swedish Empire every time.
7045	1	a	to unlock the ultra settings in graphics go in to your 'user' profile in OS (C:)drive 'user' file click it then click the file with your name on it. then 'app data'file then 'roaming' file. then look for a file named 'the creative assembly' click it. then Click file 'empire' the click ' scripts' file then you will see a 'preferences.empire_script' open with note pad and scroll until you see **gfx_video_memory** it will have a '0' next to it erase that amd put '536870192' then save the note pad and it should start poifectly :)
7047	1	a	Best with Darth Mod. Now thinking about buying Napoleon too, should i or no?
7049	1	a	So far its fun and a bold design forward go total war keep marching on...
7051	1	a	whatch out to not get addic to it :|
7053	1	a	Nice fine polished gameplay and great graphics.  Gameplay: 9/10  Graphics 8/10  Audio 8/10  Value For Money: 8/10   All up, this game is worth getting if you love the Total War series. 9/10
7055	1	a	Played as The Netherlands, took over France, and made Quebec my puppet. I like my french ice cold. 10/10
7057	1	a	Great American Independence Campaign. Lots of bugs which have been ironed out but not eliminated. Nations tend to be mere color swaps of each other &amp; this get's tired quickly. Recommend Napoleon TW a whole lot more. Seriously lacking when it comes to the other big 18th Century event, the French Revolution.
7059	1	a	Yeah, pretty good game. [HIGHLY UNFINISHED AND RUSHED BY E.A] But still...... a good game..
700	0	a	i don't even know how i lasted so long on here it kind of sucks big balls
701	0	a	Great game, unnaceptable amount of crashes. game crashes just about every turn. Completely unnaceptable. I have a relatively new computer, a great internet connection and windows 7. No reason for this. I would recomend this game if only not for the game killing crashes. Save your money and dont buy this POS.
7061	1	a	Empire is still the best Total War ever published
7063	1	a	tis good
7065	1	a	I liked the game but wish the producers would have added empire total war multiplayer campaign. I personally think it would have made the game 10 times better but the campaign single player was the bomb it was awesome how you could take over the world i give this game an 8 out of 10
7067	1	a	This game caters to many different things: trade, military tactics, and diplomatic means. to conquer not only the European world, but the America's and India. Great game, as are all Total War games, with great historical acuracy, that is if that is how you want to play it.
7069	1	a	awesome buy it no matter the price unless you ahve an issue with pure awesomeness the murderign of armies in mass  war tactics strategy patience  politics revolutions  and so forth thsi game is the best
7071	1	a	Yes.  This game simulates being a field general and sea admiral of the 1700's and 1800's in a fun way.  This is my first total war game, my previous strategy experience is with Heroes of might and magic, Starcraft II, and Civ II and V.  This game plays much like Civ in terms of nation developement with the addition that the combat is fought as RTS (very slow paced and larger compared to Starcraft)  The graphics are fine. Nothing spectacular, but enough that in 2014 they don't feel retro.  PLAY THE 'Road to Independence' story if you are unfamiliar with Total War! It does a very good job of introducing the systems in the game.
7073	1	a	Great game for those who love that miniature field army expierence brought to you by the Total War team. Also what I would consider a good starting point for someone looking to enter the Total War franchise or RTT/Turnbased Strategy gaming. The most played game in my library, last CD based PC game I ever bought and the game that brought me to steam.  10/10  (PS I highly suggest looking into mods for a challange such as Darthmod)
7075	1	a	aRE U NOT ENTERTAINED
7077	1	a	100+ hours, anyone who loves simple controls, and intense line battles, this is the game for you!
7079	1	a	Great game 10/10  
7081	1	a	With all of the patches this game has recived since it's original launch, this is actually a pretty good game. Playable, if not amazing graphics wise, the UI isn't impossible to understand and the tutorial is detailed enough to get you started and know how to play the game. Considering Rome II's current state, I recommend Empire over Rome II at the moment. Give it a little while and it should be on par with Empire, probably after Attila comes out
7083	1	a	Its pretty good. You can shoot frenchies with old muskets
7085	1	a	asome game an stargety game 
7087	1	a	what a great game 10/10
7089	1	a	a fine example of what a stratagy game should persist of
7091	1	a	One of my fav total war games.... with Darthmod of course
7093	1	a	An amazing iteration of total war, for fans of previous titles this will make sense, the battles are much slower affairs were fire and move is the only way to make things work otherwise a fantastic and extremely deep simulation of world domination  awesome
7095	1	a	A Brilliant strategy game. 5/5
7097	1	a	Although it is now an older total war game, with the help of mods and its massive campaign map, it is still one of the best total war games out there. Diversity from the east and the steppes to Europe to the Americas. Whether you are a TW veteran or new to the series, I would highly recommend Empire Total War.
7099	1	a	First Total War game, bought it in 2010 and still occasionally play it. It is a lot of fun when you first get it, but you will learn about the bugs a little bit on through the game, especially in sieges. Despite the bugs, once you learn how to avoid them, the game is very fun and you will enjoy it a lot. Here's what I think about it:  Pros: -Being a Total War game you actually fight the battles unlike most strategy games, which I find a lot of fun! -Very Large Map=Lots to Conquer -Not very complicated to learn -3 different regions to conquer: America, India, and Europe -Campaign for the United States is pretty fun -Lots of mods to play with (I like Darth Mod and would recommend it)! -Different troops for different nations -Good Selection of nations  Cons: -Sieges are a little bit buggy, especially with defending and moving groups of units you put together -Campaign a little buggy, after the 200th turn chances of corrupt data increases a lot (lost a United States save with my nation spread all the way to Russia, 150+ hours on that save). -Emptyness in the Western United States (there may not of been cities there at the time, but the cities that are there should include all the land there, it looks very bare without it, especially on the map)  Should I buy it? Yes, just learn to deal with the few bugs, and during a very long campaign with around 200+ turns start having more than one save in case one of them becomes corrupt.
7101	1	a	the bigger the army and navy,the land i get
7103	1	a	I'm actually surprised to see that I've sunk 51 hours into this game. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it - I did, and I'm giving the game a thumbs up because of that - but it didn't quite capture me as much as the previous Total War games did. I think some of this is personal preference, in that I'm just not as interested in this era of history. But I also think the game became unnecessarily complicated in its mechanics, and for some reason I never quite 'got' the combat like I did in the more traditional swords and shields combat of the previous games. I haven't played Napoleon, but I'm reliably informed that it's basically a better version of Empire, so if you're looking for a Total War game with muskets and bright uniforms, you should probably buy that instead.
7105	1	a	Most AWESOME game of it's genre.. Honestly, haven't played a better game. It focuses on both realism and logic, which makes it twice realistic. Not to mention the perfect battle animation and design. Historical background is also correct and accurate. Most exquisite! Big THUMBS UP!
7107	1	a	Just play this game!! 
7109	1	a	I love this game, with the correct mod installed it is awesome. But it is still great by itself.The grand campaign can last you for up to a month just to finish.
7111	1	a	An extraordinary game, one of the best strategies I've ever played. Love the TBS mixed in with RTS (land, naval, and seige battles). Keep up the TW series, Creative Assembly.
7113	1	a	possibly the greatest game ever created...ever
7115	1	a	my favorite total war by far, all the different campaigns present different challenges and the agents have just the right influence on the game. very addictive for the military strategist.
7117	1	a	One of, if not, the best strategy games I have played. I like to think of it as a limited CIV 5, but you control the armies in battle.
7119	1	a	such a great game even though it was made in 2008, the only thing that i dident like much was the cannons i think they lacked firepower but besides that im realy enjoying this game and hope they continue to create these types of games
7121	1	a	Being a Big Fan of the 'Total War' Series.. I must give this game it's share in ackowledgement. Like all the other Total War games before and After this one.. Empire: Total War captures the Fun and Interesting idea of combat through a 'God-Like' view. Open Control to each and every unit you deploy. No matter how old this game may be, it'll always have a place in my and each fan's hearts. Definitely a game i'll be playing in the future!
7123	1	a	Captured the whole world with America deleted my whole army and navy raised taxes level to max gain 10468 gold each turn 3 turns lost 75% of my land 10/10
7125	1	a	Great for anyone looking for that true conquer the world game. Now it just needs steam workshop.
7127	1	a	Defeat the market economy.  Make this game free.  Raise the communism  ♥♥♥♥ the capitalism.  Communists unite.  ☭
7129	1	a	Best ever advanced strategy. You will have best ever spend ho..weeks
7131	1	a	its good for a strategy game 
7133	1	a	Empire Total War is a really neat Total War game, it has great tactics, good multiplayer, and good graphics. Sure, napoleon may have better graphics or what ever, but Empire is simple and fun, and I am sticking to it.
7135	1	a	
7137	1	a	the game is good but it's graphicks are pretty bad + the AI sucks.
7139	1	a	The only downside to this game? It takes patience. Lots and lots of patience. If you're like me and only play the grand strategy part of it, you'll be subject to long load times and lots of waiting (enough to make minimizing it and watching some YouTube a viable option). Otherwise, everything about this is great, making it my favorite game of all time. My favorite part is by far the sense of progression. As your Empire grows and advances, and you get better and more unique units (and buildings and other options) as the game progresses. The graphics are also still great for an older game. Every gameplay element is solid, from colonizing to battles. You will not be disappointed.
7141	1	a	One of my favorites, while the gameplay was a little buggy I really enjoyed it and absolutely loved Napoleon: Total War(the expansion to this).
7143	1	a	An amazing game even to this day in 2014!!
7145	1	a	this game is very adticting i think you should try it! it is awsome!
7147	1	a	If you like historical games and strategy games you will like this game. Empire is rather notorious in the total war community for bieng a buggy failure but its so much after bieng patched.   The Single-player will provide hours of just..one..more..turn, and will challenge you in ways (Russia is usually a pain in the ♥♥♥) and can make you very satisfied after you've completed it(or completely wasted your time). The campaign map is fairly efficient, with tabs like diplomacy and research. The map also might have some performance issues depending on your computer but it is overall a decnt part of the game. The battles are smooth and interesting, even though it has its issues. Your army is clearly defined against the enemies with the troop colors or the banner representing the nation you're playing on top of one of your units.   Overall its a great game to waste time on.
7149	1	a	Awesome RTS that takes place in the 17th century. This game has absolutly stunning graphics. Command an army of 3000+ soldiers in land battles, siege battles, and unbelievably realistic looking naval battles. You can aslo choose from many different factions like America, France, Russian, Prussia, British, native tribes, and many more! If you want to play an RTS of completely epic proportions this would be the game for you.
7151	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played. every single time you start a new game, its different.
7153	1	a	Throughout the years there are very few games that stick out and remain replayable. This game is a splendid exception, even years after not playing Empire: Total War I still get the same joy out of every minute of play. I would recommend this to all gamers who enjoy the genre this game showcases, it doesa great job and continues to be a hit.
7155	1	a	Great game my fav stratagy series
7157	1	a	This is a really good game, but if you are still deciding weather to buy it or not i would wait untill it goes on sale closer to christmas time.   9/10 great game
7159	1	a	This game is great!just wish I had more play time,lol
7161	1	a	Really Fun!
7163	1	a	My men did charged the enemy and a blob formation yet I still win.
7165	1	a	  The following content in this game, it has:
7167	1	a	If you love the Total War series like me, then let me say something about this game. This game is the worst Total War I have ever played. Does not contain a lot of cities to conquer, the game feels devoid of life. Shogun 2 is much much more better than this.
7169	1	a	Attacked France as America they ran 1776/10 would Murica stomp again
7171	1	a	Play this game, it is great.
7173	1	a	One of the easier of the Total War games, with my tatics staying more or less the same for all difficulties, if you want a challenge I'd recommend being the Netherlands. Having said that there's something gratifying about decimating and army with artillery and making them retreat without sustaining a single casualty.
7175	1	a	I loved this game when it was first released... 6 years on I still love although the grapics are getting hard to stomach esspecially compared to ROME2....  10/10 from me... this is in my opinion the best TWgame in the series, it has the largest campain map, first in the series to introduse 3D sea battles and the TW team did the 3D sea battles extremely well, the commodoties trade income system was a very well done added feature, adding minor settlements to the region to support the main settlement was another more realistic approach to developing an empire than previous games.... there are to many good points to mention.  bad points.... still to this day even after all these years from release, the AI... I cant understand some of the desicions the AI makes.... eg: when playing as Prussia in Hard Mode (Normal is far to easy), you start with a high diplomatic standing with Great Britain... your strongest friendship among the major factions.... first turn establish a trade agreement with them, they accept with no hesitation with a very posative responce in the diplomacy screen.... you as prussia on turn 2-3 have war declared on you by Austria (Britains Ally) Britain refuse to join their war against you forfeting their alliance with Austria... they remain a friend of Prussia. turn 6-7 after a few battles and skirmishes with Austria and maybe taking the odd territory you see Britain embark a massive Army on a Fleet heading into the Baltic sea...? turn 8 offer an alliance with GB... they accept with open arms and no counter offer, GB and PRUSSIA are now allied. turn 9 GB lands its Army in East Prussia declaring war and taking the city of Konigsburg from its ally Prussia... WTF!!!!!  that is my only hate about this game, the AI in campain mode is a real let down..... the difficulty settings are far to variant, the gap between Normal difficulty and hard is massive, the game is way to easy on Normal mode but on Hard the AI far to unpredictable, esspecialy when it comes to treraties and diplomacy... its more like playing another player completly disregarding any need for treaties.... its great that over the years TW had made improvements to the AI in the battle map and a few other little tweaks but they really needed to focus on the AI in the Campain in my opinion.  apart from that a wonderfully enjoyable game  I hope and I cant wait to see EMPIRE2: TOTAL WAR if/when they make it.
7177	1	a	Very good TW game probably one of the best.
7179	1	a	Great game if you wish to rule an empire and take over the world but you have to be very patient
7181	1	a	Accurate world domination simulator.
7183	1	a	This TW game is good but not my favorite. Worth the $ on a sale and you get some real fun out of it if you enjoy history.
7185	1	a	Started as Austria-Hungary. Made alliance with Polish Commonwealth and a truce with Ottomans. Started expansion into Western Europe. Conquered Italy and Northern Africa. Broke truce with Ottomans. Conquered the Balcans and Greece. Made new truce. Spain conquers Portugal. ohneinyoudidn't.jpeg  Declare war to France and make alliance with Great Britain. Conquer southern France and vilipendiously destroy Spain. France wants a truce. Demand territory in America. Get free New France and Quebec for peace. Expand south, destroying the Thirteen Colonies with GB's help. Meanwhile destroy the Ottomans and start annihilation of the Indians (maharya).  Meanwhile I already conquered the entirety of southern Europe, plus the American East Coast, some Caribbean isles and northern India.  &gt;forget to realise Poland was conquered some turns ago &gt;Sweden dominates Eastern Europe &gt;they attack me &gt;I forget about the main territory near the capital &gt;suffer extreme casualties  11\10 would burn IKEA furniture again
7187	1	a	Exalent game with one massive problem, the shockingly bad AI destroyes this game mods will help you get through this so what I suggest is you buy this game and then get AI improvements. Other than that it is a amazing game.
7189	1	a	What can I say it's a total war game need I say more!!!!!!!! :)
7191	1	a	Would have enjoyed this game more if the poor people would stop whinging every 5 seconds about their tax
7193	1	a	This is probably one of my favroite games of all times, you can tell by how many hours I've played. It's very realistic, the weaponry is not overkill were every shot hits and its not were an artillery shell lands and everyone is dead in the area. It all depends on the type and size of the shell, normally, a direct hit from a 6 pounder will kill about 5 of their guys while a direct hit with a howitzer will kill ten. The graphics are amazing, just because it is 6 years old doesn't mean the graphics are bad. every face is different. The world in this game is massive spanning the Bahama's, North America, Central America, the Northern part of South America, Europe, North Africa, The Middle East, and India. Each nation has a huge assortment of troops and a tech tree that goes on by the ages. A suggustion is to play as Britian, they are my personal favroite. 11/10, its amazing.
7195	1	a	What an awesome game. Creative Assembly created a perfect view into the history the 18th century
7197	1	a	Stoping the french revolution by making france english? yes please. Nazi Prussia taking over europe? yes please. An native american taking a ♥♥♥♥. no just no       10/10 Amazing
7199	1	a	Always loved Total War series. And i was not disappointed when checking this one out. My 2nd best right after Medieval II. Campaign 10/10 Battles 7/10 A.I. 6/10 Graphics 7/10
7201	1	a	Great game,will keep you busy for many hours..............
7203	1	a	Epic game ever!! 
7205	1	a	Enjoyable combat with a huge vareity of units to suit every play style and every situation. The game also has gives you the ability to become overlord of the world and what's not to like abiut that.
7207	1	a	very good game and a good buy
7209	1	a	Aaaaa...Another Review on an Epic Total War game ..where to begin ? Awesome RTS / Turned based game covering the battles and skirmishes taking placing during the 18th centery ...and id Recommend to everyone
7211	1	a	Absolutely yes and the modding capabilities make it a great buy.
7213	1	a	I luv war strategy games and this my fav  9999/10 CHARGE ALL YOUR MEN SIMULATOR 2015
7215	1	a	I love this game go over 300 hours played. What i love is the graphics and the game play. I bought the historical units love them. What i hate is the AI it is oftem dumb and dosnt know what to do. I watch a unit of calvary run down 10 units of line infantry but never attack. Also during a sieg the AI never attack but with three units and they had three huge armies attacking. They could of won but i did with 8 units. Dont get me wrong this game is amazing. Warning you need a good computer and good graphics card. If you get that this game is unstoppable.
7217	1	a	+ three continents, + a lot of nations with many unique units each, + interesting way to develop regions, + technologies, + due to the diversification of unit rooster the battles are played in many different ways, + some units have abilities like planting mines, etc., + multiplayer quick battle place you in the army from the region you are currently living in (fe: if you are Spanish then you get Spain), + amazing naval battles, + hero like units (only one regiment per the entire country). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - most of the unique units are provided by DLCs, - useless artilleries, - the game is unplayable without mods (DarthMod!), - despite three continents there are not so many regions to conquer.  It used to be my favourite Total War game until I have discovered Shogun 2. Anyway, the game with DarthMod is one of the best strategy game.
7219	1	a	Simply one of the best games ever. After a rough start, after all the updates and the mods from the community, this game is a jewel.
7221	1	a	Must have patience when you play this game, and it's addicting.
7223	1	a	Very good Strategy game 10/10
7225	1	a	Takes a long time between turns. Other than that, a good game.
7227	1	a	10/10 Best Total war game ever !
7229	1	a	I have mixed feelings about this game and its sequel, Napoleon.  On the one hand, they explore a time period (1700-1815) that's sadly neglected in games. It's a rich and fascinating epoch that includes the rise and fall of huge empires, the first global conflicts like the Seven Years War, the intellectual and cultural revolution of the Enlightenment, the shift from an age of highly-regulated 'limited warfare' to massive armies based on conscription, the birth of the United States, the French Revolution, and so on. ETW spans the entire 18th century, and had the potential to be a grand-scale masterpiece.  In some ways, it delivers on that promise, especially with the help of mods (Darthmod is an absolute must). It has a huge campaign map that spans three continents, naval battles, land battles with thousands of infantrymen slugging it out to the accompaniment of artillery fire and cavalry charges, streamlined diplomacy, and a complex tech tree. Wars in ETW have a distinctly 18th-century flavor to them: colonial conflicts turn into battles for global mastery, while coalitions of great powers form intricate webs of alliances. The modded AI puts up a good fight, and will take over your colonies and wreck your trade if you're not careful.  But the world in Empire and Napoleon just doesn't feel as vibrant and alive as it did in Rome 1 and Medieval 2, which preceded ETW. In Medieval 2, your faction leader and his/her heirs were playable characters, as were merchants, diplomats, assassins, priests, and so on. There were crusades, marriages, heretics, and the Pope to worry about, and managing your settlements had some real depth to it. Each faction felt unique thanks to the voice-acting and a rich variety of specialty units. There were world-changing events like the Mongol invasion and bubonic plague.  Most of that is gone in Empire. Your faction leaders are almost invisible, relegated to a 'Government' screen, and only give some abstract bonuses to things like unit upkeep. Diplomats, merchants, and settlement-building have been pretty much 'streamlined' out of the game entirely. There are no game-changing events like the Roman Civil War or the Mongol Invasion to liven things up in the midgame.   Factions feel identical. It doesn't matter if you're playing as Prussia, France, the Ottoman Empire, or Great Britain; all factions have the same units (line infantry and a few flavors of cavalry and artillery), without any real strengths or weaknesses. The only difference is your starting position.  Maybe the biggest letdown is the impact technologies have on your faction. I think it would have been brilliant move to have industrial and Enlightenment advances give you economic boosts at the expense of public order (workers' uprisings / strikes, upper-class coups and revolutions). After all, this is what happened in history. But instead, the 'clamor for reform' penalties are so slight as to hardly make a difference. Researching Fire by Rank makes a bigger impact on the game than Utilitarianism or The Rights of Man, or industrial technology that would have destroyed older crafts or uprooted peasants.  ETW also does nothing to model the historical problems faced by huge empires of the time. Constant wars and over-expansion are encouraged; there's no penalties on public order as long as you're winning. In reality, though, even a successful 18th-century war could leave a nation spent and destabilized: the American Revolution was caused by the costs of Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, and in turn the French Revolution was caused in part by the costs of aid to the United States. It would've been great to see a risk/reward factor in place - expand at the risk of uprisings at home and abroad. This could have led to a more elastic mid/late game, and would have added an extra dimension to strategy. In Medieval and Rome, you really feel like you're traversing an entire era of human history; in Empire, a hundred years pass, but the world hardly seems to change at all.  Finally, ETW and Napoleon both lack some of the extra polish and flavor that earlier games had. Unmodded, the soundtrack is dull and repetitive. The lack of period music is just baffling to me, and the voice acting is stale and leaves much to be desired. Factions, units, and settlements feel copy-pasted; it's all the same, just with slightly different coats of paint. And even though the battles feel authentic, both games have a toy soldier vibe to them; they lack the grit and brutality of the other entries in the series.  After several hundred hours, both Empire and Napoleon feel like a letdown. They're not bad at all, and they're worth playing just for a chance to explore a neglected historical period. But every time I play them, I can't shake the regret that they could have been so much more.
7231	1	a	The game itself is good but the graphics are shocking,a real let down...
7233	1	a	Many hours of fun with this game and a varied choice of nations to be bringing up new challenges to tackle :)
7235	1	a	Alot of fun! i spent a couple of hours of playing i recomment this game big time alot of fun and thinking of strategies. if its on sale i recommend to invest on this game cause its really fun!
7237	1	a	it is just simply amazing
7239	1	a	Empire Total War starts in the year 1700. Well of course the British Isles were never full united at the time. All the developers had to do was make England, Scotland and Ireland all independent in 1700, than in the turn year of 1707 you get an Event with unifies the Scottish &amp; English thrones giving you the name Great Britain and the Union Flag of 1707-1801. Ireland should never be part of GB since it never joined until 1801, so why didn't they just make Ireland Independent from Britain and make them a Protectorate which cannot unite with Britain unless conquered through war. If there is ever a chance of an Empire 2: Total War it could be an idea that Total War could use, we have the technology!   Besides the campaign start date in-accuracy with the british situation I recommend this game to anyone who loves tactical warfare of the 18th century.
7241	1	a	One of my favorites and truly a gem in the Total War series of games. Refreshing break from the endless melee conflict of earlier eras. The Dutch can rule the world. Wooden shoes for ALL OF YOU!!!
7243	1	a	This game is great but lacks the charm of Rome or Medieval. The infamous warscape engine works well with 18th century warfare so i can deal with the no unit collision aspect. The game has a turn based campaign but the fun begins with the battles. I love this games battles i love sorounding the enemy and destroying them. The campaign map has added towns where you can specialise them. But i don't like how they made the buildings a bit simplistic. I like romes buildings becuase i could specialise a city to become a militarised or a town for growth or even a trading hub. The game's battles are fun you can take down larger armies by using woods and skimishers. I love taking pot-shots and the enemy. I enjoyed this game a lot becuase it is set in the 1700s my favorite time in history. But the kinda bombed on the Naval battles. I would give this game a 8/10. I would recomend this to anyone who has played total war and any historians.
7245	1	a	Loved the detail and depth of the game could do with a few more villages to expand as regions grow, but other than that hours of enjoyment.
7247	1	a	This is my Favorite Total War game to date, I still like it over Rome 2. and if you install DarthMod it is truly Amazing
7249	1	a	by far one of the best games i have ever played its good enough to make it onto my honorable mentions on my top 10 best games of all time the total war series was an amazing idea for games i have not played all the games though but i will play every single one the game is so amazing it feels like a true war it fullfills what ive wanted in a game just warfare in an older time it amazing its got decent graphics that are very easy to put up with and a descent story the games very addicting my final verdict will be 8/10
705	0	a	Terrible game showing the clear slide of CA isn't making terrible games.
7251	1	a	Great game
7253	1	a	Had ottoman organ gun set up in front of fort gate in case they busted through. They did. General charged in and organ guns killed the entire unit. He was the strongest general and the only think keeping the army together. The entire army retreated. Lost battle in 2 minutes 10/10
7255	1	a	Not even the best line infantry can stop the charge of sikh warriors and war elephants. Steamrolled my way through India, the mid east, Russia and Purssia. Maratha supremacy mutha fukas.
7257	1	a	7/10
7259	1	a	The game that i can't stop playing. This game is the real boss, just like the other Total war series games, just with more places to bring hell to. Keep up the work, lads, and please, patch in some more diplomacy options.
7261	1	a	Great game if you like to conquer the new world and have the natives take back their lands or be some white power race like the Brits or the U.S.A. lol
7263	1	a	Game is very good, and so realistic. I brough somehwere around 2-3 thousand swedish infantry into the Colonies in the americans and slaughtered the indians, just like it happened all those years ago
7265	1	a	another great total war game !
7267	1	a	One of the funnest games I have played. Would recomend tho those who love in battle strategy.
707	0	a	The game concept is great, but the execution is abysmally poor. I am running a 670, 4.8ghz 2500k, 16gb ram &amp; ssd. 6 years after the release of this game I cannot even maintain close to a stable 60 fps at 1600x900 resolution and medium-high settings (no AA). It is also a buggy mess with constant crashes and the onset of random stuttering which requires frequent game resets. Despite these problems I have continued trying to play it as it is just so much fun in between the moments of insane frustration.
7269	1	a	369 Hrs of game play. If that is not a recommendation than what is?????
7271	1	a	I can't stress this enough but I literally spent one whole week during summer 24/7 when this game first came out building my empire and loving every single minister, general and admiral who did me proud.  I had one Admiral who was pretty much the head of my campaign in the Americas being at the head of every naval battle imaginable. He gained several traits and accolades including a very charming parrot I named Jerry. So anyway the Americas Campaign couldnt have gone better I owned the sea and the land now all that was left was India so I sent my fleet and my well seasoned admiral across the great ocean blue. Few turns later maneuvering my troops through europe and persia the tell tale ding ding of my ships arriving in indian waters. Yay. Then followed an all too familiar ding ding. The Admiral had died of natural causes on the voyage. Spent twenty minutes in shock wondering who would take care of Jerry.
7273	1	a	Great Game! Big maps, 18th Century Warfare, Not much bugs. 9/10
7275	1	a	Best turn based strategy game ever.
7277	1	a	Really spectacular game! For all you 17th century war lovers this is what I would recommened!! 
7279	1	a	Excellent Strategy game, with good graphics, complex campaigns, and intense gameplay.
7281	1	a	With Almost 1200 HOURS, I Think Its Safe For Me To Say I Would Recommend This Game To ANYONE; This Game Lets You Control Everything Under Campaign, And Is One Of The Best Graphics, You See Everything Down To The Thread Of The Soilders Shirt, And Campaign, You Control EVERYTHING&lt; as i said before &gt; I Give This Game 10/10, WAY BETTER THEN SHOGUN 2!!!!!!!!
7283	1	a	THIS GAME DOWNLOADED IN SPANISH? WTF I CANNOT READ ANYTHING RRR YOU STEAM!!....
7285	1	a	9/10 Could have more to it, but really good for the price. I have over 200 hrs offline just for reference. Plus it's moddable.
709	0	a	slightly less enjoyable than gonorrhea
7287	1	a	Mixed feelings. I really like the game, the setting and everything. But there's the but. Turns are really long even for a Total War game, and I mean waiting for them to change. Some bugs. Provinces a little too big for my taste, then again it does feature Europe, India and America
7289	1	a	People give this game a lot of stick but I don't think it's that bad a game. Yes it's not perfect, but it's still a really enjoyable game to play.
7291	1	a	A Very enjoyable world based TBS. Basic to average politics and map based military movements though the highlight is clearly the close up real time tactical battles and good looking battlefields.
7293	1	a	This is (in my opinion) the best total war series game by far. It adds a good balance of strategy and pure combat, astounding graphics and definatly worth the money.
7295	1	a	For those who loved Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars,this is a must have!
7297	1	a	I played the game not on my steam version. I have over 1000 hours on non steam version.  This game is pretty good, but it has bugs creative never fixed. The naval combat is amazing and computers nowadays can finally run it properly.   This is probably the best Total War game made, except maybe Shogun 2.
7299	1	a	it is a great strategy game and war sim and is 10/10-shrek 2015
7301	1	a	Bought this game 4 years ago and continues to be one of my favourites. Be any one of a very numerous amount of countries as you gallivant about the Americas, Europe, and Indian Subcontinent, many of these factions with their own special units and quirks.  The game has recieved a major facelift from previous Total War installments, and is alltogether a rather decently polished game.  Pros + Very large map + Versitility of units + Naval Battles (With a bit of a learning curve, absolutely gorgeous to watch) + Hand-to-hand combat between individual units + Great graphical improvement over previous games + Overall polished feeling/ Good UI  Cons - The battle AI could use some work, as is common in many Total War games - The 'Warpath' Campaign, though flavourful and different, falls a little flat - A number of bugs that have since not been fixed, but nothing game-breaking (for me at least) - Diplomacy broken, the AI is often relunctant to accept peace even with a doomstack seiging the capital - Reaching the 'tipping point' where youre making too much money and steamroll everything, your results may vary  A game for any and every total war fan.
7303	1	a	This is my favourite Total War Game. Maybe it's the time periiod as I'm really interested in the history but the game is really fun too. Both Vanila and Modded it''s fun to play. While the units are all quite similar, each Nation has it's strengths and weaknesses. i love the Naval combat and usually rely heavily on Navies for blockading and trade superiority in my play style. Play it. The only downside is that your allys will turn on you for no reason and the diplomacy sucks. Mods try to fix this though.
7305	1	a	Wow, this is some good stuff.
711	0	a	Diffinitly my least favorite total war out of them all. It is lacking some things that the other tittles bring forword. that being sead it is worth the money when it is on sale but i would deffinitly play the other tittles first
7307	1	a	i dont like the turn based but other than that the skirmish battles where it isnt turn based is fun
7309	1	a	The Russians took over Crimea. 10/10 for realism.
7311	1	a	Ever feel like defeating Cornwallis yourself? Well, here you go.
7313	1	a	Played as Maratha, after reconquering all of India I sailed 7 huge armies to Britain in 7 tiny trade ships. And then I proceeded to pillage it repeatedly until Britain was in Venice.  10/10 would take revenge on dem arrogant genocide monkeys for historical reasons again.
7315	1	a	MOST ADDICTING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.
7317	1	a	It's a awesome game apart from a few bugs and glitches here and there, but the glitches and bugs DO NOT affect the gameplay in anyway! Or is it just my opinion?
7319	1	a	Played it for a bit. Gets repetitive around hour 1000. Still I would recommend it.
7321	1	a	Buy dis shizz now !!!!
7323	1	a	Very good software. I use each time I need doccument for work.
7325	1	a	Classic.
7327	1	a	Good battles, good music, good campaign, good units. Have played Rome Total War 1 and these 2 games are about the same in quality
7329	1	a	My history techare always said the genocide of an entire race of natives was abad thing, she was wrong 10/10 would genocide again
7331	1	a	Great Game 
7333	1	a	Hey play this game. Conquer the world. And defeat the Mighty British.
7335	1	a	Simply put I love this game! This was my introduction to Total war games in general and I was blown away. The game was rather glitchy on release back in 2011, yet it has been constantly patched and updated and it is a brilliant turn based historical strategy game set in the 1700s. If you like strategy with large scale battles added in then this game is for you. The single player map is hugeee, including Europe, North America and India. There are many different factions and units to choose from, you are spoilt for choice really. I know some still prefer the older Rome or Shogun 2 etc etc but this is and always will be the one for me. I like to play on the multiplayer servers from time to time which are getting smaller and smaller but you still find a few keen players who can give you a good challenge and waste a few hours away. 10/10 just for the memories.
7337	1	a	Probably one of the better of the Total War games. AI definitely seems to be smarter and more technical than before. It actually tries to flank or out maneuver your troops like a true opponent. Sometimes it seems that it's reading your moves and making the best possible counter to seize your plans and thrash them to uselessness.
7339	1	a	great game!!!!!!!!!!
7341	1	a	second best total war game
713	0	a	ON LINUX: Do not buy!  Used to play on Windows and really liked this game. Recommending for WS, even though not the best Total War I've played ;-).  But having Ubuntu 14.04 (mainstream distribution), having few nicely working games from Steam, this is huge disappointment. Optimalization obviously not right (if at all), lags everywhere (and I am sure not because of PC) even menu lags. During winter battles FPS droppes to 0.2 :D even with the lowest details (unplayable whole winter battles, da), but other battles 'work'. And mostly: sudden crashes, usually during naval battles (which I liked the most from Empire), but when spending 1,5 hours by shooting sails and capturing, last ship left to capture and game crashes, would you keep playing Campaign? Happened four times in different battles before moved me to write this review! I am sad I have to write this, but guess Linux fans of Total War series have to wait for another working TW Steam game.  Sum: Unplayable campaign because of winter battles (^unless wanna suffer through) and sudden crashes. :-(   P.S.: Would Love to read in comments about everything miraculously working in game on Linux.
7343	1	a	i think this game is really good and i enjoy it a lot. this is by far one of the BEST total war games i have ever played
7345	1	a	Over 1000 hours 
7347	1	a	I've upvoting this because I can tell it's a good game, but I have one HUGE gripe with it. It's *incredibly* unintuitive. Nothing about the interface, battles, etc is friendly. The game is deep and quite complex, but it's no excuse for how unintuitive things are. It's like throwing a child into the deep end of a swimming pool with a cinder block tied to his ankles and telling him to swim.  I don't mind a steep learning curve at all, but even after having learned it still feels like a clunky mess. I see why the game is beloved among strategy fans, but few games I have played are overall as frustrating as this.   It gets a recommendation purely on the basis that it would still be appealing to strat fans.
7349	1	a	Absolutely stunning visuals, epic battles and fluid satisfying combat. If you have a good enough system you'll love it.
7351	1	a	If you want a game that is hugely strategy based and very addicting...look no farther! You can either play story mode as the growing United States or pick almost ANY other major nation in 1700 and run that nation however you want with the globe at your mercy! Battle control scenes are epic and amazingly fun...plus once you get really good you can bring your tactics to online play against real people! And if you want to beef it up I suggest you download Darthmod as it will make the game ten times even better for campaigns! It was my first ever Total War game and will always be my favorite. BEST overall TOTAL WAR GAME...period!!!
7353	1	a	- Starts warpath campaign as Plains Nation - Creates an army and destroys Upper Louisiana - Notices the US is also at war with spain - Offers a deal to the USA for a military alliance - Deal is denied - Tries again this time offering 5000 gold - Deal is denied - 20 Turns later with 42000 gold I try again - USA Accepts Alliance - Smirks and begins to move all armies to New Orleans - USA Has cancelled Alliance with you - *Throws monitor out window and burns disk*  10/10 Would lose 42000 Gold again.
7355	1	a	Oh man... The world domination is so fun. I'm still playing it! So far i've almost lost france twice (playing as Great Britain) to revolts until I realized how easy it was to simply excempt it from taxes... Anyway its really and does take some time strategizing your next move. You cant simply declare war on everyone at once. Although this game is old there are several fun mods. I highly recommend anyone who plays total war games or any RTS games in general to buy this game and check it out!
7357	1	a	over all this game has great gameplay, you must manage economy, plan land and sea battles, and have fun. something missing is an AI for sea battles, sea battles are terrible in this game, you can tell your ships to pursue and enemy ship and all they will do is start turning trying to find a path while the enemy ship constantly bombards you, land battles though, are amazing, real military strategy can be employed for results. the games politics menus could be better but they are satisfactory. this game has definitely been worth buying.
7359	1	a	I like you should play
7361	1	a	Making masts of ships topple since 2009.
7363	1	a	Best Strategy game i have ever Played Beats Command And Coquer And age of empires Combined
7365	1	a	one of the best strategy game ever !!!!
7367	1	a	A true Total War game best of its kind, totaly love this game 10/10
7369	1	a	They found the perfect balance of military strategy and political management for this genre. Incredibly buggy and slow at times but this game is just amazing. I personally think the sea battles blow. They are a slower version of the sea battles in Sid Meier's Pirates! Plus the campaign locks gameplay features until you beat it. However, those are the only bad things I can say about this game. It's a must have for the RTS junkie. Oh and the DLC is cool but not essential.
7371	1	a	Approved!
7373	1	a	Got into multiplayer for the first time Went into a server People were friendly at the beginning Something happened War Raged among them Fight began I quited to avoid trouble 10/10 Would play multiplayer again (if there were servers available) 
7375	1	a	All the Total War series suffer from some AI pathfiding issues. However, that can be overlooked due to how addictive and fun they are to play.
7377	1	a	Realy Cool Game (BUY IT NOW ! )
7379	1	a	Great game for all stratagists 
7381	1	a	just murderd 1000 indian miltia's with 240 line infantry 10/10 would butcher again
7383	1	a	Just outstanding...
7385	1	a	This game is great for all thoose who like turn based strategie games and being able to manege a goverment along with whos in the offices, who you want to trade with, be at war with, have alliences with, and be in charge of (if you can convince the nation to let you be in charge of them that is). In this game you create and field armies and navys along with spys, missionaries (religious), and gentelmen (reserchers/ duelists). In this game you can also research new technology to take your nation to the top of the world. I mean isn't it always great when you just mass armies near a neutural countries borders, declare war on them, and in one turn have destroyed the faction.
7387	1	a	One of thebest total war games so far. The rebellions are far to common (considering the 18th century had very few rebellions, if it was the middle ages with Baron revolts I would understand). The Cavalry and Artilerry are nerfed in this game, but it still is a highly enjoyable experience. I have played this game for over 200 hours (off steam). It doesn't deserve the bad press it gets. This game is a worthwhile buy.
7389	1	a	A man 99 years old, lays dying on his deathbed.... My life.....tis the end.....*gasp* (reaches for laptop) Maybe....maybe i can just have one more turn...   8 years later he finally dies....  Yes...this game is that powerful.....  dot dot dot dot
7391	1	a	I bought this game quite awhile back, it isnt as well polished as Mediveal 2 total war or Shogun 2 total war but its polished enough to be enjoyable to anyone who wishes to create large colonial empires based around using lots of fancily dressed men shooting at each other  this is the first total war game to feature rts ship battles, they arent as good as in SHogun but they are very fun, as long as it doesnt freeze up and crash youll be fine  to really get the most fun out of this game try out the Darth Mod with it, it really opens the game up
7393	1	a	Conquered Spain as the U.S had to deal with spanish uprisings best game for ♥♥♥♥ing up history poi
7395	1	a	Evil white man simulator 2009
7397	1	a	A very good stratigic game for thinkers and fighters!
7399	1	a	After playing a decent amount of Shogun2 I've only recently been encouraged to go to E: TW and played some early games on vanilla, but was initially pointed to the DarthMod so that's where I went and have to say it's all that and a bag of chips so far. I expect many more hours to come...
7401	1	a	AWESOME!!THIS HAS SOME GLITCHES SO WHAT THIS IS AWESOM!!!!!!
7403	1	a	Great game it has crash every moment! 10/10
7405	1	a	Amazing game!! There is very little lag. There are a lot of countries in campaign. I highly recemmend this game.
7407	1	a	I love strategy games and this one is perfect. My computercan only run medium graphics, but the game still looks nice. Battles are so mucgh fun and easy to get used to.
717	0	a	The game is completely unplayable due to blurry, unreadable texts. If you don't have this issue, you're lucky, if you have this, just screw you, there is no solution for you and developers don't want to do anything with this for years. Don't be a looser and don't pay for this piece of crap, until they move they're lazy asses and fix it.
7409	1	a	Amazing. Arguably the best game Total War have ever made! I've spent countles hours playing this game and still not bored.  Absolute 10/10
7411	1	a	Loving this gamen, played medival total war b4 but this is better :)
7413	1	a	Very good battle gameplay. Several bugs but no game breaking ones. Love the campaign 9/10
7415	1	a	Old game , but still new for me .
7417	1	a	It’s a fine effort and I appreciate the scope, but personally I think Napoleon: Total War is the superior game. Unless you really want to battle it out in India or the Americas I’d suggest you pick up Napoleon instead.
7419	1	a	Easy and Normal-meh the Ai just keep running around the battlefield and sending sucide squad,but steam roll them is fun..  go Hard and Very Hard-good god how did the Ai had money income so fast..ouch..and their shooting muskets accurate than my troops..  Well two can play the  game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLZzeP7m8jM   For coward like me I guess...well now Im okay..at least United States are not bad,since America had lot of technologies already(and so other nations..damn)  Well of course if u want to conquer the world,just go the bank..11/10  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I found its funny how the an army of Company Infantry(EIC from India)travel the sea to get to America..lol Maratha destroy Britain..yea of course Britain Campaign Ai are damn sick,they just sit in London all the time(they dont even care about the frenchies....except in America..yea.. The only way to made easy attack on fort was use Hard Mortar(Grenadiers)Russian or Ottoman,just use line infantry as bait,and let the grenadiers shoot their boomstick and let the grenade land on enemy feet 11/10 Use carronade frigate to pound heavy first rate,such wow...wow Pirate Galleon front cannon shoot my 4th rate(1 cannon hit)-kaboom...roasted sailor..such wow Enemy artillery crew(just rallied from broken) using my dead crew cannons to shoot my troops from rear 0_O  This game fun when AI doing something good to kill your army.    
7421	1	a	i have played this game a little and i like it
718	0	a	Empire: Total War. Sigh.  I really tried to give this a chance, ignoring the launch issues at the time, and not even getting it until 5 years after it's original release. That time should have been more than adequate for any outstanding bugs or problems to be fixed, but Empire: Total War was a victim of its own ambition, and it still has glaring flaws, the AI and the broken siege battles.   To be fair, the game has its pros: the 18th century's scope, 3 theatres of war, the fun of directing line battles and the major bugs that prevented it from being playable are gone, but it still feels lacking and solely unpolished. Which hurts.  If you love the period and can stomach its faults it is servicable, but it certainly is not a great Total War.
7423	1	a	Despite many hating this game, and thinking its one of the worst in the series, I love this game. Its not flawless or perfect, but with mods like darthmod, you get to experience what it would have been like to fight in a massive line battle against the british in the revolutionary war. And if your not a fan of this time period how about the civil war or world war 1, because this game has big expansive mods for these too. In conclusion if you, like me, love this time period then this is a must buy, and to those who aren't fans of this time period at least give it a go.
7425	1	a	Best total war honestly its got everything you need to be content with it.
7427	1	a	My overall favorite total war... Better then napoleon
7429	1	a	Worth its price especially if you put darthmod!
7431	1	a	Really wish it had co-op campaign :(
7433	1	a	This game is amazing! I got this game during the free weekend and it was super fun. I didnt get to see the naval combat but the land battles where epic
7435	1	a	the world is not what you think in this game make war on anyone you can and you'll be fine
7437	1	a	an awesome game that represents american history very well 
7439	1	a	Covering a vital part of European History, expanding into the American Revolution, Empire Total War provides an excellent mix of economic management and military strategy/tactics. The addition of the Warpath Campaign provides a much more indepth look at the progression of European invasion into the New World.
7441	1	a	its fun playing in 3 days then you take a break
7443	1	a	A genuine masterpiece, its historical accuracy appealed to me. I enjoyed its time setting which is around when many of the great european powers founded their empires. Overall an exemplary which truely deserves to be part of the Total war series.
7445	1	a	Ships still get stuck, and AI is still stupid (though Warpath Campaign challenges me due to initial setting).  However, this is fun, well-polished game which runs on Linux perfectly.  Graphics is gorgeous, replayability is very high, what's not to like.
7447	1	a	The Game Is Awesome:Totalwar
7449	1	a	Love this game throughly. Easily my favorite Total War game. Later games do have better diplomacy, however. It gets very annoying to see the same countries go to war every game, almost like it is scripted somewhere. However, it is hugely improved over Medieval II Total War. I wish also that the map was more broken down, for instance making Spain multiple regions. 9.75/10
7451	1	a	Excellent game with great replay value due to varying victory conditions and geography.  You must make sure to pay attention to terrain and don't let your infantry wander in front of your cannon because they simply will not stop.
7453	1	a	dont be fooled by the hours played on this account. i had over 2k hours on my old pc before i had actual internet.  this game i cant put into words how ♥♥♥♥ing much i love it. buy it, play it, love it unconditionally forever.
7455	1	a	This is a very solid game for the price and is basically a large scale Napoleon : Total War which is also one of my favorites. It is pretty good if you enjoy other Total War games or just turn-based games in general.
7457	1	a	Great game, worth the money! 8/10
7459	1	a	Played as Austria. Get f***ed by venice that has a single region. Played as Prussia, conquered Poland, Austria and Bavaria. Good to be Prussian. Get f***ed by the British. Played as British, f***ed everyone else. Good to be tea drinking gentlemen.
7461	1	a	Accidentally unified all the Germanic peoples and started a world war. Would recommend.
7463	1	a	a hightly stratigic higly tactical games not for the newbies
7465	1	a	Almost naturally, developers Creative Assembly followed hard on the heels of Medieval 2 (and its 'Kingdoms' expansion pack) with another instalment of the Total War series. Empire is both a real time and turn based strategy game.   Naval combat, for the first time, is part of carving out an empire throughout Europe. Players must learn how best to maneouvre sailings ships, depending on wind direction, and direct devastating broadsides on enemy ships with deadly precision. Land battles are still a major feature - although much has changed since the Middle Ages: players must learn about volley-fire and capturing key buildings in an age of gunpowder. Generals are now able to recruit in the field, while it's possible for soldiers to desert, even suffer from climate attrition.  Empire has made some changes to characters: Diplomats have gone, although diplomacy with other nations is still much part of the gameplay and forms now part of the campaign map interface. Rakes are a combination of both spy and assassin roles. And during this period of enlightenment, 'Gentlemen' can infiltrate settlements, aid in scientific research, commit acts of subterfuge, and challenge rivals to duels!   A steady income is one vital factor to Total War; overseas Trade plays a big part in Empire. Recruit merchant ships and send them to distant trade posts before your rivals lay claim to the spoils. The campaign map itself is more richly detailed than before, being split into three theatres: New World, Europe, and India. As head of your chosen nation, you must decide over which of these you'd like to expand your empire and gain the fruits of conquered lands.   One additional side to Empire is the seperate campaign 'Road to Independence'. This tells the fascinating story of how England's New World colonies grew, rose to prominence during the Seven Years War, then finally all thirteen colonies declared independence thus war upon their former motherland. Such a feature emphasized key dramtic events during the 18th century period. There was a certain thrill establishing the United States as a new power in the world!   On a more negative note, however, Empire did stumble on a few issues. The Historical Battles section is always something that could have been exploited to the full within the Total War series. While it's nice having several scenarios, I felt (as with previous titles) the developers could have worked on at least a dozen key battles. The 18th century was crammed with numerous engagements, for example Blenheim was a decisive battle between Louis IV's France and Great Britain and her allies, or the Battle of Poltava during the Northern War between Russia and Sweden. Sadly, these and other such possibilities missed out star status in this section. But, since Empire requires a Steam connection, it's not too late for this to be remedied via automatic or even seperate purchase updates. It would be good of Creative Assembly to revisit and improve upon Empire in this way.  I didn't think much to the Warpath Campaign expansion. In my opinion, it has to be the weakest out of all the Total War series. For one thing, something similar yet far more exciting and in-depth had already been done in Medieval: Kingdoms (Americas). But also - and no offence meant to the American native contingent - the factions lacked that extra something to grab my attention. Again, we return to the possibilities prevalent of the 18th century: another sweeping campaign similar to the scope and calibre of 'Road to Independence' would have been a far better option. The natives could have played a more pivotal role during a 'Seven Years War' expansion, for example, with more factions and specialized units to play around with. Yet here, 'Warpath' just seemed a little bit boring, a wasted opportunity.  One ground-breaking feature introduced by Empire is the model animation. During melee, I was transfixed by soldiers displaying a variety of moves: thrusts, parries, dodges, rolls, slashes, rifle butts....a deadly ballet all combined into truly authentic battle scenes. It's something I can watch time and again. Hand-to-hand fighting moves were touched upon in Medieval 2 yet never fully developed into what Empire has to offer; elaborate combat animation has now become an integral mainstay for the Total War series battles.   During battles, it's possible for a troop unit to get stuck. It could be down to uneven ground, or a troublesome soldier got caught on a nearby tree, etc - yet it's so annoying when such a tiny discrepancy interferes with your orders to fire-at-will on enemy within range. Whilst your line troops are stood idly by, said enemy has no trouble peppering them with musket fire as if they were no more than wooden dummies. Another frustration happened to me during an 'end turn'. This reveals AI moves....and upon reaching the Marathas Confederation it just froze! I tried reloading again and again, even disabled 'show AI moves' option, yet the same thing occurred.   And so Empire still needs some work: bugs ironing out, campaign updates, improvements upon what could have been - hopefully what might yet be - a near perfect addition to the Total War series. I'm writing this five years after the game itself was released, now Rome II is in the spotlight - perhaps, if that game is constantly being updated and DLC purchase content can be added, perhaps Empire will receive similar overhaul treatment. Nevertheless, as it stands, Empire Total War has some fantastic moments and the occasional flair of gameplay genius: ensuring hours of battles, campaign planning, and artful diplomacy!
7467	1	a	its a well-made game with good developers.The graphics are real life.Thank you Empire Total War 
7469	1	a	Buggy as hell. Yet fun to run a nation in the age of enlightment and empires.
7471	1	a	in multiplayer it says we have different versions but wwe have no extensdionsd or mods please help us
7473	1	a	The fact that I can play this on my potato laptop is a thumbs up in my book
7475	1	a	Most incredible game I've ever played. Bought it years ago and still play it to this day.
7477	1	a	Played it a bit. Isnt that bad.
7479	1	a	tottaly awesome game if you like strategy!=)
7481	1	a	Sometimes i load up my very first game as Prussia and look at my amazing Prussian world and go ... you know what ima raise taxes in mexico so they can rebel. then make peace give them money and then 20 years later dispacth my legions and destroy mexico. then cry because i own the worlds again and feel lonely
7483	1	a	Amazing game! I would give it a 5/5 it is a amazing game thanks sega!  
7485	1	a	7/10, would conquer the world as India again.   Fun game, and it's interesting balancing your relations with other countries based upon your government type. Combat can be buggy, though ~ especially around walls. In fact, expect the game to wig out in some way when anything wall-like is involved. It was a good idea to use period paintings (for loading screens) and background music in the game. There are some good mods available for it. The campaign map has changed significantly from M2TW. The cheat menu is no longer present, so you can't use cheats to work around bugs :(. Big graphics improvement over the predecessor, as always. Changing government types is a little counter-intuitive, and it seems strange that you have to do Monarchy -&gt; Republic -&gt; Constitutional Monarchy, rather than going, say, Monarchy -&gt; Constitutional Monarchy, but, ah, well.
7487	1	a	I play as Prussia and no matter how much of europe i annex i still have a lower score than the maratha confederacy. So i invade India where I outnumber them 5 to 1 since i didnt have much time i had the ai fight it. I lost. Then the Marathas invade Spain. 10 turns later Berlin is a smoldering ruin. 12/10 would get invaded again
7489	1	a	One of the best total wars
7491	1	a	Classic total war but with a twist I wish they would make another one but perhaps based in the Victorian era ? there are a few problems with this game mainly that units such as the line infrantry all look the same for any nation apart from the specials and colours this seems to be the same for all nations I would recommend this game but like all total war games you need to be interested in the era it's based
7493	1	a	It´s Good game if you have nothing to do. Long gameplay and good multiplayer.
7495	1	a	Best total war game ever. Very much detailed gamelay. Diplomatic Relations, wars and govenrence systems are very well prepared. 10/10
7497	1	a	This is a fantastic game where you can change all of history. For instance in my game George Washington died before America actually became America
7499	1	a	This game made me clense America of all the indian savages. 11/10 for Accuracy.
7501	1	a	Great game, easily lose hours into playing a campaign.
721	0	a	 https://www.change.org/p/creative-assembly-sega-make-total-warhammer-complete-on-release/u/14325974?tk=QlEvG_8G-TIabK9ZOh6zZYeg3vbGNMbJvEqUyHWqULA&amp;utm_source=petition_update&amp;utm_medium=email   I cannot recomend this game or anyother by CA or Sega or these guys ever again. Instead of keeping an ear open to the only people who matter, the greed of these individuals has peaked. Don't buy from them ever.
7503	1	a	It's a very good game, at least it kept me in school for a little while longer.
7505	1	a	This game is well done and very rewarding to win. It can seem rather complex at first. However, it is manageable and once you get a hang of it, Empire: Total War is an vigorating expirience that can provide a nice challenge or can allow you to completely anialate armies, whatever you want. It's your army after all.
7507	1	a	I have only played one game.... that is all.  10/10
7509	1	a	Best Total War game, in my opinion. Huge improvement in graphics from Med 2; addictive, satisfying gameplay; and no chars on multiplayer. All you could ask for.
7511	1	a	Best strategy !
7513	1	a	First time I played this game I loved it...and still do after years of playing.
7515	1	a	Love it
7517	1	a	This is what I call a 'Wine Game' a game in which you sit down and have a nice glass of wine while playing, While doing that I got half drunk (light drinker) then I unlocked my inner Prussian war lord and kicked the ♥♥♥♥ out of austria with little of my soldiers' deaths.
7519	1	a	Play total war to become a warmaster!
723	0	a	Got Black screen on startup. I dont know how to fix it and CA ignoring this problem
724	0	a	It's a really good game, i mean, it's fun, decent graphics, loads of units, but any problems?  YES, the MP is ♥♥♥♥ and it may work a few times, this game is only fun at MP, as of now, i don't reccomend you this game.
7521	1	a	Totaly hooked on this game, hours of fun.
7523	1	a	&gt;Buys Empire total war &gt;Plays as Great Britain &gt;In game and made a cannon army &gt;Decides to go to war with Russia &gt;Sends Cannon army at Moscow &gt;Realizes that Russia had over 15 Allies &gt;Allies Come at my capital &gt;My capital is tooken over &gt;Manages to get Moscow Capital &gt;Without paying any attention to my other enemies they take over the colonies and canada &gt;I decide to kill all russians &gt;America is tooken over by Indians &gt;Manages to get rid of all russians &gt;Russians come back in a rebellion *Gets mad* &gt;Russians take over Moscow again &gt;I try to take back moscow, Failed *rages* &gt;Russians take over every state *quits game*  69/10 Would try to Britain again.
7525	1	a	My most played game by far has the most replayability but its only for the patient and a more then decent computer
7527	1	a	Awesome game. Still play it today.
7529	1	a	Empire Total War I love the game to bits the line battles are amazing and bring much stragety into the battles. Downside is the campaign map I dont know why but it just bugs me for some reason. Overall I love total war games and nothing going to change it.
7531	1	a	I loved doing Linebattles online, and singleplayer.  Until my computer took an arrow... to the computer.
725	0	a	This game has too many bugs, Creative Assembly at least improve Unit Collision in Battle.
7533	1	a	i think that you should make a dlc wich adds new forts in the single player mode for =siege battels
7535	1	a	This is where they began the trend of disappointing oversimplification of regions... But before it gripped them too tightly. As a result you have massive, sprawling Imperial conflicts over three continents with beautiful infantry forces, slightly anemic artillery and... I think there were some horses around too... The AI is as ever, ropy and the path finding needs a slap but there's a tech tree this time and they 'fixed' the bug that made England invincible the first few months. Ahhh, who cares - just get it, load it up and march on Paris, you know you want to! 
7537	1	a	Love the game
7539	1	a	Slaughtered native americans with cannons   10/10 would commit genocide again
7541	1	a	10/10 best simulator game of da year m89
7543	1	a	Play as Sweden All my neighbors declare war Lose in 30 turns 10/10 would get stomped again
7545	1	a	Eh. Wouldn't be my go-to Total War game. My first was Shogun 2 last year. Going to this it is like going to the stone age of games. Doesn't seem to be much freedom in what your units can do. Very simplified and not all that interesting. At least for land battles.  Given how that is the majority of the game, I feel like I can throw in my input.  If you're looking at buying this, I can tell you Shogun 2 is MUCH more interesting and rewarding.
7547	1	a	Total War. Turn based civilation game with RTS combat. Total war mixs strengths from the Civilations games with more fast paced games like dawn of war.Fight in land or sea with a variety of units and countries to choose from This is a fun and challenging game
7549	1	a	Just 4 hours of this game made me love this. i played as prussia because they started with the least regions so i wanted to build it up and it would be more easy to defend. OH I WAS WRONG. i have to deal with austria , britain , united states , saxony so i allied with poland. i gave austria to poland because austria is a pain to control and it would stop austria from entering my lands without dealing with my ally poland. now i have to deal with united states and bravia to the left of berlin. 0_0
7551	1	a	So many hours gone
7553	1	a	Amazing game. Pushes you to think of inventive battlefield strategies and bring out your inner general
7555	1	a	Great game.
7557	1	a	great game once you get used to it!
726	0	a	If you are a Rome Total War fan like me, then you will not like this game. The game play is ok until you have to battle which is alot. *sigh* That was my favorite part of RTW because you had an army at your fingertips fighting for you. Basically they did what you commanded them to do and it was awesome. The same can NOT be said for Empire Total War. Let me explain. More times then I would like to count, my troops... no sorry, what I mean to say is that a troop from a platoon or company of men I was commanding would get stuck and/or not move with the group he was with. This in turn would hold the platoon or company up from following my orders to attack or just defend themselves. They would always wait for one guy before following orders. Basically they would get slaughtered because this game was poorly programmed. Dont waste your time playing this game like I did. There are much better games out than this crap. 3/10  This guy knows what I'm talking about  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naQaRIaXyAU 
7559	1	a	one of my favorite total wars. mix in some banished and this game would eat my life.
7561	1	a	* Plays as the mighty Great Britain*  * United States forms in 1710*  * France gets completely taken over by the United Provinces by 1755* * Russia sells me what is now Ukraine*  * I take over all of North America *  * United States takes over Nassau in the Caribbean*  10/10 most historically accurate game
7563	1	a	Game is fun, the controls are jsut a bit different than previous total war games because most units are ranged units, but i loved the game so much i watched the patriot 3 times O_o
7565	1	a	I think that the game is pretty damn good, and that's all there is to it 
7567	1	a	&gt;play as sweden &gt;'dont invade russia in winter' &gt;does that &gt;mfw i win &gt;russia is now swedish &gt;go on to fight a 30 year war against austria, and poland &gt;prussia goes full hitler and almost conquers all of central europe &gt;i go full allies, prussia is gone &gt;i control almost all of central and eastern europe &gt;fight hard war against france and spain &gt;i win again &gt; france is now swedish &gt;spain stays spainish sadly &gt;invade my longest ally, great britain &gt;take over the british isles &gt;wtf.jpg &gt;fight ridiculous war against spain &gt;ally with the usa for 5000 &gt;they break alliance next turn &gt;usa is now swedish &gt;mfw i conquered all of the united states because of 5000 dollars &gt;revolution in my nation &gt;rebellions across the great empire &gt;empire falls &gt;god laughs at me &gt;wife leaves me &gt;evicted from my aparment  12/10 would conquer the world again and then lose it all to democracy
7569	1	a	This game by far was one of the best total war games after the first Rome total war. Highly recomended
7571	1	a	The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started. Empire: Total War is a must buy for any strategy lover and in general for anyone who owns a PC. Creative Assembly has taken the best aspects of the Total War saga adding new ones that integrate perfectly in the gameplay and the result is a game with wonderfully deep strategy and tactics elements.
7573	1	a	Endless hours of fun. can't wait for Warhammer Total War
7575	1	a	This was my introduction into the series and for me was pretty awesome. I played my first campaign on easy and literally wiped out the world. This is a decent mixture of Guns and Melee. If you prefer Guns and line firing go onto Napoleon if you like melee get Medievel, Attila or my favorites Shogun Rise of the Samurai or Rome 2. If you're into Grand Campaigns than this is it for you...out of all the games it has my favorite campaign because it has almost the entire world for you to conquer.
7577	1	a	For most of the Total War Fanbase I've noticed for most people it's either their favorite or most hated,at least until ROME 2 came out.For me?Neither, my personel favorite is MED2 and my least favorite is SHOGUN2.While It's A great game in its own right poor A.I and a departure from 'old school' Total War games turned away many.When I first bought 2-3 years ago I had to force myself to play it and I never finshied a campagin about 1 year ago I found this game's modding community.While there are many great mods my favorite is Darthmod.It's for people like me who think while empire is great it could be a lot better.long story short if you're looking for a great unmodded 18 century game nappleon is the better choice but if you can learn to love it EMPIRE will become one of your most played steam games.
728	0	a	I've found it difficult to play, and I think a big reason is that I've already played Shogun II. Obviously, there is going to be a step back in terms of gameplay systems and graphics because of age, but there is something about this Total War game that seems clunkier than the rest.
7579	1	a	It is AMAZING
7581	1	a	Five Stars!
7583	1	a	GREAT GAME AND AWESOME BATTLES
729	0	a	This Game is Suck! super lagging!! i love total war but i hate empire cos this is stubid super bugs lagging.
730	0	a	Well i downloaded a mod that crashed and i had to reinstall it and they won't respond when i wan't a refund because it is in spanish and i can't changh it so i do not
731	0	a	Would absolutely love to recommend but game-breaking bugs and terrible AI make this one not worth your time and/or money. I've had to quit numerous battles I've won because an enemy's routing unit gets stuck on an object and magically becomes invincible. Upon quitting, somehow I'm always met with the 'Defeat!' screen. Campaign map troop movements by the CPU can become confused, leaving turns for CPU factions taking 10+ minutes to complete (no joke), ultimately destroying the experience. Granted, the latter only seems to happen when you continue after completing a campaign's objectives, but what's the point of allowing the player go for complete global domination if it's unplayable? Sadly, these issues (and more) plague the game for many and were never addressed by the developer. I love Total War, and I want to love this iteration so badly. I just can't recommend a game you can't fully complete and that has broken AI in crucial areas. Darthmod is amazing but doesn't address everything. Guess I'm sticking with Medieval II for the time being.
732	0	a	First the game seems very buggy two instances are in defending forts where if an attacking unit is positioned near a corner they seem to really suffer low casualties, also at times the fort is damaged, but I can't repair, and often the enemy is suppose to be attacking, but just sits there or just bombards with artillery, which doesn't kill many units, and takes forever. Also you can't extend military access and the battle screen doesn't let you know where you are. Intercepting counts as defense, which is fine if they would just clarify that you can defend a bridge by staying in the fort behind it. Also not allowing multiple units in buildings just seems wierd.
7585	1	a	It's a good game, but gets boring after a while, it's like Civilization but, more detailed in the combat.
7587	1	a	Great game you should buy it.
7589	1	a	This game is a gem, 10/10 from me. It was challenging as well as revolutionary for the Total War series. Nothing better than watching a ship explode during a naval battle or the occasional bayonet charge.
7591	1	a	Awesome game! If you like games like Age of Empires or Stronghold, you will love this game. It is similar to other strategy games, but the battles and many other aspects are different.
733	0	a	I do not recommed this as it is about buyable content ! 
7593	1	a	Thumbs up, fantasy sucks!
7595	1	a	I like the historical content of this game 
7597	1	a	Great game, I would recommend it to anyone who likes history!
7599	1	a	Play as Sweden during the build up to the great nordic war as Carolus Rex  Fight of and conquer Russia, Denmark and Poland-Lithuania  Rule all of Scandinavia in the great Swedish empire after Truce, and the conquest of all Russia   Conquer Prussia and finish off the Poland-Lithuanian dogs once and for all  End up with an Empire stretching from the North east of the map, to Iceland, and all of Germany, Scandinavia, and parts of Northern Italy  Crush Venice, ally with the Spanish  Somehow neglect that public order back in Stockholm (which was perfect one turn ago) has now deteriorated  March Carolus Rex and the Grand Swedish army back to the homeland to quell any silly notions of revolution  Don't make it back in time, oh well, the rebels only have a small army, I will crush them next turn  Cross the border and cry as two thirds of your army join the rebels, who then take the captial a turn later, ending the Swedish Empire  10/10 would neglect the homeland once more
7601	1	a	a good total war game , great for any veterains of the series or if you just want to command large armys . A few noticable problems being that your forces when commanded often dont do anything and even when moving it feels sluggish and almost like your moving in slowmotion but this is fixed by the fastforward button althou this causes some minor lag . these are to me the most noticable problems but overall will not effect your game experience. GO BUY THIS GAME M8
7603	1	a	Prussia Strong
734	0	a	Creative Assembly abandoned this game, no updates, no improvments nothing. Not even a workshop this game is dead as a door nail all the flaws are still going to be there no matter what unless you mod it. This game can be entertaining for while but bugs and terrible AI make this game annoying to play long term. I've played virtually every Total War since the very first one so I had high hopes for this one, but this game is just not very fun the difficutly settings are pointless raising difficulty doesn't make anything difficult it just makes everyone angry with you and more likely to declare war. Difficulty should reflect skill level which it doesn't in this game. The playablity is very limited once you've beat it a few times your bored with it only reason I've played this game recently is because I haven't played it in years and thought I'd play again simply because I own the game. DO NOT BUY! If you do wait for a sale because this game is not worth what they normally charge.
7605	1	a	I reccomend this game and there is so much rubbish crashing and lag but the overall gameplay is ok. After rage quiting and breaking your screen there is a strategic game behind the pants finish and please don't play on easy, give yourself the most elite army ever and call yourself a hero after beating one unit of puckle gun.
7607	1	a	If you like Total War and guns. Well here you go.
7609	1	a	11/10
7611	1	a	A solid game that deserves a spot in the collection of every fan of the Total War series. Fans of grand strategy games should pick this up as well. Neither group will be disappointed.
735	0	a	Can't even set my troops to run. They just do whatever they like. Just buy fall of the samurai and be happy.
7613	1	a	its a game you can play a thousand times and never have the same outcome
7615	1	a	great but frustrating game
737	0	a	worst Total War
7617	1	a	If you're looking for a game to celebrate your homelands supremacy (in my case glorious Britania) then look no further, for you have found the game you seek, my only gripe with this game is the the people who play on multiplayer, if you are playing the defense you are accused of camping and people leave the game, and if you aren't careful to tell people a maximum number of light infantry they bring a full army of riflemen to a battle which ruins the experience, it makes the game a 'attempt to get close but then they just shoot you at their superior range then runaway' match which is awful. Play with friends and trustworthy people and remember to be offensive about other people's choice of country so it makes the match personal. All in all an insanely good game when played with the right people.
7619	1	a	Don't play this without Darthmod.  Excellent game with most of the world at your disposal.
7621	1	a	Where to start? I am a huge fan of the Total War series, and this is the most played game in my library, so needless to say: I LOVE IT! The historical setting, grand campaigns streching across 3 continents, and unique strategies and tactics for each faction give this game so much personality. The moments leading up to a large engagement are tense as you jocky for ideal firing lines and artilery positions. As battles progress and stakes get higher, finding clever tricks to make the enemy turn tail and run is incredibly satisfying and the feeling of total victory when a hated foe is finally swept from the map is sublime.  Take control of major powers of the 18th century, lead armies in epic yet realistic, real-time battles. Interact with other nations on a massive set-piece, turn based grand campaign map by waging war, trading, competing in a technological arms race.  Pros: -Great mix of real-time and turn-based strategy -Fight epic battles and take command as a general. -Rewrite history however you like (India invades Mexico? YOU BET!) Cons: -WILL EAT AWAY AT YOUR LIFE!
7623	1	a	Earth shattering.
7625	1	a	Empire has the best map and worst UI
7627	1	a	it would be nice to be able to play the grand campain would be good
7629	1	a	One of the best games in the Total War franchise. To me Rome&gt; Empire&gt; Medieval II.
7631	1	a	This game is super awesome! I have always been fascinated with the warfare of the era and the UNIFORMS ARE SO SEXY!!!!! Everything about this game is amazing! People say this game have many bugs and probems but i havent seen themor i have and just didnt care, if it doesnt ruin the gameplay, im ok with it. 1000000/10 Its Amazing!
7633	1	a	A very fun and addictive game
7635	1	a	Blockaded one port in the Netherlands. I put them in national dept.    9/11 Would (Insert funny phrase here) again.
7637	1	a	This game is great for 1700s-1800s fans and stratagists but also for other total war fans
7639	1	a	I do highly recommend this game, although I really wish they'd bring back the Multiplayer Grand Campaign. Can you please consider if possible? Please &amp; Thank you....
7641	1	a	Very good game and a wonderful campaign for the USA. It gets a big boring lategame when you are eternally powerful, but it is worth the price. (As of now 4.99, but I say up to 15 dollars.)  Multiplayer servers still active.
7643	1	a	omg buy this game instead of something like world of warcraft. If you like history of course. the game goes awesome when you add fifes and drums in the background. good times..... that was 5 seconds ago but..... good times
7645	1	a	great game my 542+ hours on the game prove this, nothing like watching redcoats fire by rank :D
7647	1	a	This game could be so much more better this it need a remake.
7649	1	a	This was the title that got me into Total War back in 2013. When everyone else was drooling over samurai in Shogun II, I was a few years too late playing Empire with this new invention I found called a reliable internet connection (not to be outdone by Steam a year later).  And I've devoated a few hundred hours to CA ever since.  There really is nothing quite like Empire. Maybe it's the lines of neatly-dressed men firing at each other, conquering the world at your beck and call. Maybe it's the history behind it, in a century that saw a resurgence in nationalism and the early quakes of ideology. Maybe it's the sheer romance of the time period. Redardless of my personal ramblings, millions of users and these thousands of reviews don't lie: Empire is a (relatively) modern classic that immerses gameplay and history in a thunderous ballroom dance that is typical of the time period and my dry wit.  Get this game or I'll give you a '10/10, would ____ again' gag.
7651	1	a	tis awesome
7653	1	a	The best stratigic simulation I've played ever!!!
7655	1	a	great game although the ai sucks and increasing the difficulty of the game just gives the ai buffs but thats why we have mods like darthmod and imperial destroyer. Plus I really like the era of the 18th century. I just love conquering cities and forcing the populace to convert to my state religion :D now i know what the spanish feel when they were forcing our ancestors to convert to Catholicism.The only thing that i do not like about the game is the fact that i get no response from host most of the time i try to play multiplayer but overall i recommend this game if you like muskets tricorne hats ships from the golden age of sail forcing your conquered subjects to convert to your religion and watching scientist and rakes kill each other in a duel to the death!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7657	1	a	Tbh I can only say this game is good for those who are new to Total War or Strategy games, and this is comeing from someone who grew up with this game and has over 1000 hours. I wish there was a sideways thumb tbh.   7/10, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 are much better games
7659	1	a	Great game. Ive been looking a risk loke game thats more complex and this is it. Conquering the earth as russia is great fun
7661	1	a	Empire Total war is one of Total War's best games where you play a faction of the 1700's, though the game dosn't encompass the whole globe and the late game gets kinda stale, each faction you play is a whole differant experience. Aswell the mini campaigns are very very fun and entertaining. Truely one of total war finer moments and should be a game consider for a reboot. I personally give empire total war a 4.7/5
7663	1	a	Nice Gameplay. Interesting historical elements. Camera Control sucks compared to Medieval total war, but enjoyable gameplay.
7665	1	a	Dating rapidly and looking forward to Empire 2 (assuming they don't pull a Rome 2 and ruin the game). Still, loved playing the game and recommend. 7/10
7667	1	a	This is an excellent game. In my view it is unsurpassed by any Total War game since, and even holds its own when compared to earlier titles such as Rome (1) Total War.  The campaign map is very pretty, and the size of the map and division into three theatres works very well. The province management/city construction system is a cool innovation from previous games. The research system is also a welcome feature which helps immerse you in the historical period. Naval battles are also   I rate it 8.5/10.
7669	1	a	this game is awesome :D
7671	1	a	yassssssssssssssss one the best strategy games i ever played
7673	1	a	Actually cant even see my mouse inside the game I guess I could recommend this game to others
7675	1	a	  absloutely love this game
7677	1	a	For me still one of the best TW games ... after the 'desease' at release with a bunch of patches solved most problems of the game during the following months. This was a hard time for many hardcore TW fans and many were really annoyed with it or still are. This is understand able, because many of the bugs were silly at least, as well some of the patches made things worse but did not improve problems. So players become feeling to be the beta testing object for CA for a still bought, but very bugged game and this is not acceptable. Empire is now running very good, but in combination with Darth Mod which improves the game to a status, which normally should be delivered by Creative Assembly itself in my opinion. I don't know in detail how Darth and his modding team did improve, but the result is only great. For example, the AI was really improved - not that AI becomes a smart enemy in campaign, but the acting was put by Darth into good rails of logical issue. Some things were improved by simple overwriting, for example the masses of merchant ships build by AI insteed war ships with the simple solution to let recruit smaller war ships (up to 4th class) in merchant ports too. I played Napoleon very often too and some of the the improvements here are missing in Empire. Napoleon itself is very interesting too, but for me too local and too small as campaign map.  To be honest, the following Shogun TW and RTW-2 brought further, very good improvements in game, but these games did not convince me to play further. RTW-2 has for me a very bad graphic and game hub design which did me more annoy as giving fun.  In conclusion, Empire is still my favorite TW game and still makes fun after nearly 3,500 hours game time!
7679	1	a	i dont know what it is about this total war game. but it's the best they made if you'll ask me.
7681	1	a	Empire, is a less laggy more diverse version of Napoleon. It runs well, alot of good maps to play on, and Plenty of factions, a handful more than napoleon has to offer. even features Elephant musketeers and elephant warriors, and the french, and even Indian tribes which are also fun to play as. I love this game. Buy it!
7683	1	a	This is a good Game. I am surprised they haven't created a Empire total War 2. You can build a Empire, of course, and change history. Such as The US Invading Britain during the War of 1812, And well, just create the world you Want. They should of made a Empire Total War 2.
7685	1	a	This was my first Total War game, and it really made me fall in love with the series as a whole. What is most impressive is the campaign, with nine playable empires and the whole world map on offer, which makes planning ahead all the more important. The long campaign spans from 1700 to 1799, giving the player the chance to establish a strong economic base (one of the most enjoyable aspects is dominating the map by the end of a campaign). The battle gameplay is also good, with a wide range of histrorically accurate units to choose from, with lends a very strategic element to each battle, as the player has to no how to counter the troops of the opposing side; a skilled player can gain victory over a numerically superior army. The online gameplay is solid, with only occasional lag issues. There are only a few minor downsides. There are occassional glitches and freezes (approximately one every fifty battles), Cavalry is very underpowered, which limits their effectiveness. They are useful against unprotected artillery and countering other mounted units, but one small infantry group can rout a far larger cavalry force. Finally, the general, while very important, has a limited range of gameplay options; the same level of morale is offered regardless of where the general is in relation to the rest of the fighting force, as long as if the general is alive or on the battlefield. Overall however, Empire Total War is an amazing tactical and historical experience, which I would gladly recommend to anyone. I would give it a score of 8/10
7687	1	a	Empire Total is a good game that makes you decided on critical issues relating to you empire, what would have made the game better is only they had a more countries or empire you can rule over, other than that out of 10 I would rate the game at 9.5,
7689	1	a	Awesome total war game, up there on my list of favorites. Very unique. Spent the whole game building just a grossly massive superpower out of GB.  battle strategy is quite a bit different than most other TW games due to the new weaponry.   One thing I learned early on though is not to ♥♥♥♥ with the iroquis indians because they will end you.   
7691	1	a	This game for me was, paradoxically, one of the best and worst Total War games. Perhaps this is because I have played so much of this title, I've had a chance to see all the best and worst parts of it. I love the time period and trans-continental features of this game, as well as the introduction of the naval battles to Total War. However, numerous small bugs and missed opportunities for improvement throughout the game, which could easily have been fixed if the game hadn't been rushed to realease so quickly, linger on and multiply to detract greatly from what could have been the best Total War game of all time.  Sadly, I find the vanilla game to be essentially unplayable due to the numerous issues and inaccuracies. However, with the addition of Darthmod (which you can find on the Total War Centre forums), you'll be able to experience a decent improvement in gameplay, but perhaps only a fraction of what the game could have become if the development had not been so rushed.  This title had so much potential, but the lack of development meant an unfinished game was released. Mods have partially offset this issue, but I can't help but imagine how amazing this game could have been if more effort was invested during development. I still recommend this game, dispite it's faults, as with Darthmod it is really a game worth having.
7693	1	a	This game is best
7695	1	a	Its a must get for fans of the total war serise and i will write about the pros and cons  Pros -you can conquer most of the globe -Its fun taking ove regians -become emperor of Europe -you can make th roman empire agian  Cons -it can get laggy at some points -the turns can go for ever -you only get 99 turns until the campagine is over  over all i would give it 8/10 thanks for reading
739	0	a	A questionable and improvable wargame. Have good graphics, wonderfull management mechanics, decent historical research and a huge and inmersive main campaign with various maps at once. But all those efforts are ruined by probably the most cheater AI of Total War Series: basically, when a single player get better, reacts crushing its own rules in economic and diplomatic issues to turn the tide, far away from any logic reason politic or strategical, as only way to maintain the challenge against him; penalizing excessively the combat automatization forces the players to fight every battle, making waste time to those not like the mere tactic or scenaries without true cenital camera. Sure that is fine on mutilplayer mode, because the impact of IA is reduced.
7697	1	a	Okay skids its story time.  -Year is like... 1730 32... I don't remeber point is as prussia I just stamped out the remaining Netherland and austrian rebels. - I am happy. - I make Prussia into the most devloped nation with metalled roads and advanced farm's entertainment militarty ect. - I set my eyes on saxtony (My ally that i spared from my crusade on germany and the sorrounding territories)  - The turn I decide to declare war Sweeden declares war on me. - I laugh. - Sweeden sends around 300-500 Soldiers to invade brendenburg  - I send 1.7K Soldiers and I ♥♥♥ rape them (While Seig Heil Viktoria is playing in the backround) - I take their occupied city in denmark.  - Russia takes their city in finland 1 turn before my forces arrive their - I ally russia - I set my eyes back on saxtony. I take their capital in 1 turn wiping out their entire army. - Poland gets pissy  - I offer them a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tech to get peace back (Mainly because I didn't have alot of men on my eastern front) They agree - Poland requests a military alliance the next turn. - I notice the marthra confederacy is in the european theatre (Mainly the middle east) - I send spies to spy on the ottoman empire. - They have a embrassingly low military presence period. - I plan to steam roll the ottomans but that is a story for when it actually happens...
7699	1	a	Despite all its kinks and some very frustrating diplomacy nonsense, (like puny nations declaring war on my massive empire and refusing trade with me, even though I could crush them) if you have the patience then this game is alright. I'd even say pretty good. Once it has been modded to enable all factions, it becomes similar to EU4 in some respects. I really liked playing the Mughal Empire, or as Persia and rebuilding the Achaemenid Empire, or the Ottomans, the Spanish, the British and even the Native Americans!  I never actually bothered with France, or even Russia for that matter, but I like armies with lots of firepower, elephants, or powerful ships, and this game delivered immensely. Enough history to keep you interested, and the battlefield was not quite an improvement from Medieval II Total War, but it was decent enough. I have nearly 400 hours on this game, and I must say, Absolute Monarchy is the best way to go in the long run. My administration was always top of the line, and it helped a lot to fire/hire whoever I wanted.  Yes this game does have some issues, and I have heard they were solved somewhat in Napoleon, although the different theaters of war took out the Americas (Wtf?) and India (Come on!), still this game has a legacy worth continuing and looking back on.  7.9/10
7701	1	a	I totally recommend this game. This is my favourite strategy game. I mean, I used to think that a strategy game should be like age of empires or, I don't know, like civilization. But combination of both real time strategy and turn based strategy makes perfect sense imo. I mean, I can't think any other way to create a strategy game anymore. Anyways, here is my pros and cons:  Pros: -Unique units for every nation and some certain regions, -Unique naval units, well, not much but there are some. -Unique tech trees for every nation, -Unique buildings for every nation, -Technologies and Buildings work together, i mean, you have to research a certain tech to unlock a certain building, and you have to build a certain building in order to unlock a new tech to be researched -Trading system is nice, there are trading posts around the world that you can occupy and trade there, -Diplomatic relations, -Protectorates, -Minor nations, -Number of possible new nations, -Voices of units are very good. Best part of the game is this. Sometimes, I wake myself up by repeating the voices of units :D -Tactics in battles are really effective. If you count on your soldier number and go straight into enemy, you may get crushed. However, you can crush the enemy when you are outnumbered too. -You can interact with surrounding in a battle, -Naval Battles, -Amount of detail of land and naval units, -Historical accuracy. -18th century, I mean, isn't it perfect? Colonization and stuff. I used to play Age of Empires 3 before ETW. But AoE3 has nothing even near to ETW, in my opinion of course... -You can play online normal battles, naval battles, siege battles, siege defence battles etc.  Cons: -Lack of playable factions. You can't play as minor nations, i wish i could. I know you can, by changing stuff in the game folder, but i don't want that. -AI gets really stupid and stubborn and jerk and selfish in diplomacy sometimes, but it is good in the battles -Main storyline is short -Your pc will get roasted if it is not really good. Or, at lower settings you will wish to get blind and never see something like that again. -Religions, as an atheist, I don't like to convert people into christianism or islam or any of the other religions, but when you are playing the game you have to. Or the people will go rage mode and starts riots and burns down places or worse, they rebel and try to take away your regions etc. -A lot of cool unique units are in the DLCs. But I don't judge, it's 2016 and every game developer does this. Bright side is the DLCs are not that expensive, i think that's something... -Grand Campaign mode is not infinite. I would be great if it was, but then it would make no sense. I mean, how could using muskets and bayonets and horses make any sense at the year 2372?  Anyways these were my pros and cons. Like said in the beginning, I totally recommend this game. If you haven't played any of the Total War games, you cannot assume that you love strategy games, because you have never played a real one. The only strategy game i have ever played that is closest to this consept was Rise of Nations. But it wasn't quite enough. I think Total War games are the best strategy games so far. Empire TW was my first total war game and I think this is the the best Total War game, imo. I couldn't play newer Total War games though. Neither my economic currency nor my pc would let me do it. However, as far as I saw from Medieval TW, Rome TW, Medieval 2 TW and obviously Empire TW, Creative Assembly knows how to create a perfect strategy game and needs to be appreciated.   Anyways, let me tell you how i felt when I first enter the game: I always wanted to try a TW game, because a lot of people recommended it to me. One day I saw this game on Steam and I thought, 'Hmm.. A Total War game. Let's see...' and I purchased this game. Then I entered the game. It seemed cool. Then I started the main story, Road to the American Independance. For the first 1-1.5 hours, I was like 'Dafuq has happened', 'Dafuq was that', 'Dafuq is this', 'Dafuq do I do?'. Yeah I really was like that. But then I started to understand what is game all about.For the following 2-3 hours I was like 'Omg omg omg', '♥♥♥♥ this game is awesome!', ' I will play this game until the death takes us apart!'. After I finished the main story, I started a Grand Campaign as Ottoman Empire [Because I am a 'Turkish Patriot' (no i'm not, just kidding, but i love my nation and our history)] And it was so much different than American campaign. Then i see the variety in this game and I was like: ' OMG, i had no idea about this game, this game is much more awesome than i thought'. Then I kept playing this game, and the game kept getting even better. I still play this game without getting bored.    So yeah, these were my opinions. I hope I did help you. Thank you for reading. Have a nice game!
7703	1	a	Empire Total War is actually the first PC game i have ever gotten and i still enjoy playing it. Empire Total War is basically Creative Studios attempt to try many innovative ideas, and include the other stuff in their older games. It is really fun to play especially with friends. Here are some pros and cons:  PROS: Tons of factions to play as  Lots of units to choose from Replayability Many different historical leaders/ generals are in the game Units are based on their historical counterparts  Campaigns are really fun and unique Many DLC's to expand each faction's unit roster  CONS: There are no multiplayer campaigns (empire was made before multiplayer campaigns) Glitches are non abundant but there are still some sprinkled in the game I have found the npc's are pretty easy to fight not many people play anymore so you will have a harder time tring to play multiplayer  All in all empire total war is an oldie but a goodie 
7705	1	a	i play total war in every games invold and i must say BEST GAMES EVER AND FUTURE GAMES EATHER 
7707	1	a	good game. wont start, goobye steam!
7709	1	a	I have owned and played all the Total War games from the first release of TW Shogun way back in 2000, to the latest TW Atila. All versions have had their pros and cons through the generations, from: terrible sprite-based graphics in an informative and easy to play early generation; through to the overly simplified mechanics of a beautifully rendered latest generation, all have had their good and the bad.    Putting aside historical inaccuracies and other criticisms of related to some liberties that may have been take to create these games, one has to remember that these are game, not simulations, and that they have to strike a balance between accuracy and playability to deliver enjoyment. That's the balance TW Empire delivers well...  I got TW Empire retail disk as soon as it came out. However, I didn’t get to really enjoy playing because the initial version ran poorly, even on my relatively powerful computer. It was playable but the choppy performance really had an impact on a poor first impression.    I played it and enjoyed how they treated the period. The masse battle lines of musketry, the roar of cannon, and the charge of sabre and lance, all really brought something to TW that had been long overdue. The quality of the battles wasn’t really better than its predecessor, just different, so different tactics had to be employed.    The more significant change was in the campaign management, which provided good improvements that added some depth, while still making the game easily managed.    I won't go to great detail about the above, but to reiterate that this is a well balanced game that weights detail and accuracy, against playability and entertainment, quite well. It combines the empire building and strategic management aspect with the real-time three dimensional tactical action well.
740	0	a	It was really good game, but to be Honest, Darthmod shall be added to this game. I don't/cant install, Because to be honest, i'm not really good at install/I was too lazy to install. Line Infantry need to wear same uniform as maryland.
7711	1	a	Very fun to play, you get sucked into the 'lore' politics and grudges. You get a descent idea of how brutal and chaotic these battles were and how quickly they could change if one flank would break or even if an artillery unit would run out of amunition.  I love the sounds during battles, especially the from the fire-arms. CA get real props for that! absolutely barable graphics and since I am a huge musket, civil war, colony war fanboy I would recummend this game without a doubt.  p.s I know it says that I have only played 11 hours but I played a whole lot on a 'borrowed' copy. And appreciate the game to much to not pay the developers for it.
7713	1	a	.
7715	1	a	Addictive, a good way to spend the night, great for people who want to relax and great for people who like humungeos fire fights with friends, although this costs a little too much, i would say wait until steam summer sales or christmas.
7717	1	a	This is a no brainer for me, as I already own Rome, Medieval, and Napoleon titles in the Total War series. This game has the largest amount of DLC available besides Shogun 2 thus far, and includes a nation that none of the other games offer, the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! So, if you have ever wanted to send the red coats running at historic battles like Bunker Hill, or be the red coats at Yorktown (LOL) then this is the game for you!
7719	1	a	This is the first game I played in the series and runs best on my low graphics computer. Second best to Napoleon Total War
7721	1	a	Take command over 18th Century troops and get independence for America, overthrow Europe as Prussia or whatever you like. There are not many restrictictions in what you can achieve, only your actions will determine the outcome of the Game. Some of the Game Mechanics are rather weird, for example if you station two infantry units directly behind each other it may occur, that the second in line shoots their own troops in the back. Same with artillery stationed behind Infantry. But all in all a very enjoyable game!
7723	1	a	one of the greatest stratiegy games i ever played 2 out of the top 5
7725	1	a	hours of game play and plenty of replay value
7727	1	a	Favourite game of all TIME!
7729	1	a	Recommended. My favourite, and in my opinion, the best Total war made. Especially good with Darthmod installed.
7731	1	a	This is the best Total war game ever! I have enjoyed this game for years and still play it. I wish Total war would go into more eras Including the world wars........
7733	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ i didnt play this 
7735	1	a	Fantastic graphics, a lot more tactical than simply charging at your enemy. Quick thinking situations and spectacular campaign.
7737	1	a	Very awesome but i wish they still had the option og deplomacy where your allowed to get your allies join a war on ur side that was already raging beisdes that i love the game
7739	1	a	What we gonna do to day : pinky,  Where trying to take over the world : brain
7741	1	a	Love Total war but this is the start of their downfall. Simple game that anyone could have made with the budget CA has. Thankfully they're mods that really make this game great. So get mods if you buy this game.
7743	1	a	awsome game love the grafics i like how you can only be the major powers and not the minor powers like saxony or denmark all in all a good game to pass the time
7745	1	a	Damn I love this game.
7747	1	a	With Darthmod, this game is a gem that will keep you busy for many hours to come. It's one of them that's still being played to this day, if you dont own this buy it.
7749	1	a	belive me after over 960 hours of play i assure you this game is ballin!
7751	1	a	Having played Napoleon Total War first, I could accept that the game wouldn't be as good as Napoleon. However, some of the features in Empire are much more interesting, such as the factions, campaign map, and battle maps but I believe that the mechanics of Naploeon Total War, as well as the AI and interesting time period clearly set a divide between the two games. Personally, I would say Empire Total War is a good game with lots of interesting and great features, however, if you want to go for a game with a better battle AI and also a more interesting time period (in my oppinion), I'd recommend this game to play but I'd recommend Napoleon Total War over Empire Total War.
7753	1	a	If I had a better PC, I wouldn't be playing this... Still, great game...
7755	1	a	What can i say one of my favorite games  if u buy it get the minor factions revenge mod
7757	1	a	An excellent real time strategy game with a massive modification community.
7759	1	a	Very nice game if you like the colonisation era. Very realistic and epic, the battles are immersive. The campaings can take countless hours to finish, and you feel proud after. The only downside is that I didn't play this game sooner!
7761	1	a	Very addicting game!!! It gives me the satisfaction of ruling the whole world...just had some difficulties with the russians and the marathan confediracy but besides that one of the best game ever!!!
7763	1	a	great game but to bad that a lot of promised features were left out at the final game
7765	1	a	great game , have spent hours playing
7767	1	a	Very nice game.
7769	1	a	Great game, great time period and great battles
7771	1	a	I enjoyed the game despite the Ai being rubbish.
7773	1	a	Great game still playin after all these years.
7775	1	a	Impressive game! One of my favourites ;)
741	0	a	Missed chance by CA of making a grand strategy game. Perhaps the era will be revisted one day, but until then not even mods can save this buggy unstable game.
7777	1	a	this was the 2nd Total War game I got and my 2nd favorite
7779	1	a	Absolutely love this game. One of my favourites and one that I keep coming back and playing time and time again.
7781	1	a	Second line of defence shot first line   11/10
7783	1	a	i love this game 
7785	1	a	A very good game, has its flaws here and there. Overall good to play.
7787	1	a	Have been a fan of the Total War franchise and this game is another of the great games in the series. Reliving historic scenarios and even changing history playing the factions.  This is a must have for players who love turn-based games!
7789	1	a	i m sorry,but this game even with the darthmod lacks a lot of things,there are almost no setlements on the map,a barren wasteland really,in darthmod the auto resolve is just insane,i lost 900 men once attacking 200 depleted soldiers,naval auto resolve is also broken,naval battles in darthmod are worse than the vanilla,surprisingly,they are slow and the hull strenght is the only stat that matters,nevermind guns,ammo types or anything else.However the vanilla left us with the maps that are so boooriiiing...  let s talk about the road to independence....uhhhh...whre do i even start?u have 2 historical carachters,george,paul revere(who s a gentleman) annnd that s it...the brits have william howe which u ll probably kill within the first turn....but then everything goes to ♥♥♥♥...regiments of grenadiers,light infantry,hessians,indians all of it will come down on u,which is so ♥♥♥♥ing unfair i can t even explain it,like maybe in vanilla it s ok,but in darthmod u reeeally have to play every ♥♥♥♥ing battle so that u don t lose all ur troops.i searched in the tech tree for a ♥♥♥♥ing missile cav cause they were kinda popular really,and there weren t any except the sheldon and light dragoons which are quite high in the tier,so u ll be done with the campaign by that time....  england should have some objectives of it s own which will get them some transports,ships and troops rather than recuiting all those troops from the territories they control,maybe some loyalist company but they re not in the game,and surprisingly they are not in darthmod either,i m not even american and i m still complaining about this...  i like this game but there are a lot of things that suck about it,vanilla and darthmod
7791	1	a	The only gripe I have with this game is the utter nonsense written about the right to keep and bear arms (in the description for the minutemen units). As an American, when I saw that I almost lost myself in a patriotic rage, and felt a responsibility to inform the gamers who may view that nonsense of the following: Clearly whoever wrote that into the unit description doesn’t understand the historical context behind the 2nd amendment, nor what a militia is, so I will provide the viewers here with some quotes from our founders. Note, the second amendment states the following: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.   'I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them.' -George Mason-  'A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves …' -Richard Henry Lee-  'And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; …' Samuel Adams  Other than that, I had some fun playing the game but I quickly got board of the repetitive battles like all other total war games, plus the map mode was buggy as all hell and had horrible framerate problems. All in all would I recommend this? I guess so....
7793	1	a	This is on of my favorite games to play on the PC   I give this a 10 out of 10
7795	1	a	&gt;am netherlands &gt;conquer india &gt;destroy farms and infrastructure  10/10 would genocide India again
7797	1	a	Why do you need to lean about Social Studies in North America when you have this game?
7799	1	a	A great game.
7801	1	a	i had only gotten this game on about 5 days ago and im already impressed.  it has some great historical background and nearly all the countries seem to be balanced.  i only have one problem with it and its that it doesn't have alot more countries. don't get me wrong, i like the countries the way they are but i would like to see some new countries be added to the fray in the next total war game.  maybe italy, germany, or even china idk.  overall, new favourite stratagy game 9/10
7803	1	a	its good, best total war i've ever played, but idk after i won the first grand campaign i dont feel like playing it again but still, it was an awesome grand campaign
7805	1	a	great game
7807	1	a	1000000/10 One of my faviorite games of all time. Huge battles. Huge fun. GO PRUSSIA!
7809	1	a	Total War has been around for a long time. Empire Total War seperates itself from the rest. I still think this might be the best total war game out there. Only other version of total war that comes close to beating this game is Shogun 2. Empire is 6 years old and still amazing!
7811	1	a	I like this game, a lot
7813	1	a	its ok, something wrong with diplomacy and my allies always want to tke my stuff, as in i want trade/they want a bit of land $3000 and unlimited access. So it is a tad broken in the grand campaign. battles are good but; all the units feel the same(footmen are all the same just have different skins).
7815	1	a	I really like it and surprisingly i am very good at it
7817	1	a	This game is so much fun! It has the best campaign of any Total War game. The reason being is that you can play on all parts of the world. From NA and SA to asia, you can watch as war rages across the globe. The only continent not included is Antarctica. So, if you like to play the campaign (and multiplayer is good too), buy this game. I would love to see an Empire 2 with new graphics features, and some more unique units. That would be perfect.
7819	1	a	Goat, American Rev
7821	1	a	7/10  The only thing that holds it back is AI diplomacy that makes no sense. Otherwise a very engaging fun RTS
7823	1	a	*Started Playing as United States *Gained Independance From Britain after a long, bloody war *Spain and France join me in a Coalition against the British Empire *With the aid of France and Spain, we exiled the British from the Americas *Built a massive army and navy then sent them across the 'pond' to invade Britain *10,000+ Americans die on British soil during the landing when we attempted to land in Wales *France sends three full stacks of armys into Britain and snatches London out from under me while im fighting all the British forces and London is left ungaurded.  *France goes through a revolution and becomes a republic, which causes a 'Different Government' negative relation with them and they break the treaty with me *After about 5 years of war, the British Empire is no more and their lands have been divided between France, Spain, and the US *France rules most of northern Europe while Spain holds Africa, the Middle East, and Italty *The Nobles rebel in my capital and establish a monarchy, leading to a new American Empire led by King Alan I *King Alan becomes tyrannical and amasses a force no other country can duplicate and begins taking over the trade, mostly the spice, Tea, and ivroy trade *Russia tries gaining a foothold in the Americas when they buy several Islands from France *King Alan counters this buy purchasing Mexico, Cuba, Guatamala, Columbia, and Hispanolia from Spain before the Russians can take them. Russians HATE the US for this move. *Russia creates large forces in the Americas to protect their holdings and causes tention between themselves and the US *20 years later, the American Empire controls all of Germany, Poland, United Provences, Greece, several states in India. *Mexico rebels and creats the country of Mexico. *Scotland rebels and creates the country of Scotland *Greece rebels and created the country of Greece. *King Alan has become completely unfavorable amung everyone including his own people *King Alan is overthrown when the Nobles rebel once more and execute him along with his cabinet of foolish governors.  *King Phillip I becomes Emperor of the American Empire *King Phillip I bans Ivory trade and sends his navy to block all trade ports that contain Ivory *Ivory value skyrockets as the world powers declare war on the US to get control of ivory trade posts *Mexico takes Texas, New Mexico, and lays seige to Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina *War with almost very nation becomes to expensive to fuel and the American Empire begins to crumble *The countries in India invade US land in India and take them for their own *The south of america has become a barren wasteland unfit for habitation as the lands have been burned and buildings destroyed so many times the land is worthless without heavy funding to rebuild *Russia declares war and Sweden joins them. Now the US can trade with no one and is quickly losing its money. *Russia invades the east coast of America and takes Virginia, Maine, New England, and Delaware *All of Americas holdings in Europe fall the emergent factions or previous owners *Russia, Sweden and Spain spend 16 years destroying my navy until the Ivory trades are opened up again *Russia controls all of North America except Phillidelphia, my capital *America becomes Russian territory and the US attempts to buy some of it's land back and call for peace *Russia and the American Empire declare peace and America begins building a force to turn on the Russians and gain it's terriroty back *Russia sees this and declares war again and takes the US last territory *The American Empire becomes nothing but a footnote in history as the only power to ever take control of most of Europe and India. The American Empire becomes nothing more than a page.  10/10 Would build an American Tyrannical Empire and lose it all again to the Russians
7825	1	a	So much to say about this game. Now, I am inexperienced when it comes to the Total War series, this being my first one. Let me tell you, if you enjoy firing mortars into native American tribes, then this game might be for you. That is if your mortars ever hit them. This game is fun, especially when all of your men decide to go from 'confident' and 'eager' to 'Shattered' or 'broken' in a split second. final rating, 1776/1776
7827	1	a	It is a awesome but time killing game 8.5/10
7829	1	a	this has been a very good game, it supported my 4gb ram laptop and i was able to play it at full speed, the History inside the Campaign has been very good, i like the detail on some of the troops when close zoomed. in other news time to kick butt with the British.
7831	1	a	Love this game so much, But it is so complicated
7833	1	a	Sea battles ruined this game. other than that, great game
7835	1	a	Great game! one of the best strategy games since cossacks :D                
7837	1	a	10/10 would destroy Russia again
7839	1	a	Great game. All the bugs are fixed, great variety of mods and so many options in the grand campaign.
7841	1	a	never played a total war game before...wow, its FUN! i see why there are so many psuedo board game strategy games.....this is the king of that style, BGRTS, they can coin them.....if you wanna fight for freedom in the most authentic way, BUY THIS!!!
7843	1	a	the only thing i hate more than the medieval age is the gunpowder age. this game was hard and when your troops and cannons shoot dirrectly into a hill and you have to reposition them its very annoying and sea battles are not that great ether. BUT for the same reasons i dont like this game i do like it. From going to the older total wars too this it mad me feel like a real general comming into a new age and having to learn the art of battle all over again. i prefer the clash of steel but this game is good. i would say its a 3.5 out of 5. the warpath campaign is the best tho. native americans were the easiest and funniest to play the game. SUGGESTION start making different color line of sites for if your line of fire is blocked by something at all. so i dont have to zoom in on evrything all the time when setting up.
7845	1	a	By the left, march!
7847	1	a	great game, always has a new take, as it randomizes events even one turn replayed. Strategy is constantl evolving as you play, so you can win or lose ground very easily.
7849	1	a	Really good game if you like the domination kind of games, but this takes that to a whole new level with diplomacy, territorial expansion and interactive battles that are realistic, the only downside is the games ai start to go crazy with diplomacy once you reach past the 1800's mark, but still good game
7851	1	a	I love it more than i love my profile picture
7853	1	a	True grand strategy, spans a massive map from the Americas to Europe to India. With darts mod battles are exciting and with tactical depth.
7855	1	a	Excellent blend of RTS and TBS, would recommend to any fan of the total war series of games.
7857	1	a	&gt;defends fort against Ottoman empire (renforced by Persia) with 3 regiments. &gt;Gives names Iron cross the fearless, Iron heart the brave, and Iron shot the accurate for their feats in battle. &gt;general dies mid skirmish &gt;iron cross the fearless is first to break 11/10 would fight for Istanbul again.  P.s. get darthmod to make this playable.
7859	1	a	At launch this game was a mess. Today, after numerous patches, it's an enjoyable romp through the early modern era but lacks some of the punch of others in the series.   Some pointers: -Battle AI is much weaker than Rome I or Shogun 2 but the breadth of the campaign map is some compensation.  -This game introduced naval battles to TW but they are more fun in Shogun 2 -Settlement construction is streamlined for better or worse -Economic buildings require more micro
7861	1	a	Fun and addictive, Like most of the early Total war franchise.
7863	1	a	Very good game and very good linux support
7865	1	a	Other than the A.i. problems. This is my favorite in the total war series. they made so many changes to the world view and city management later on that just makes the game so much slower than this one.
7867	1	a	Let there be War!
7869	1	a	Love this game, it's old, but gold.
7871	1	a	This game is the best genocide simulator I have played since Prison Architect
7873	1	a	With many many many mods its playable
7875	1	a	This game has problems. Text is blurry and too small if you have a monitor that's 1600x900 or 1366x768, that is easily fixed with a mod though. The campaign map is laggy and stuttery on even NASA's computers. Again, easily fixed with a mod. There are a few little problems like this that will keep you from enjoying the game, but with 20 minutes worth of configuring can be solved. Once you fix the game properly it's completely amazing. The scale of this game is just outstanding. Playing as the Dutch means you start with provinces in Europe, India, and America. The battles are cool as hell too. Once you get the fire by rank ability you can really unleash your muskets and the ferocity of line battles comes to life. This game is a flawed gem but it's still better than Napoleon. Shogun 2 is better imo but if you are interested in Europen history or American history I'd pick this. Also Shogun focuses more on melee combat where this is more aimed at line battles with thousands of riflemen.
7877	1	a	I played almost all the game in the Total war Series and for me this is the best one. 18th century is one of my favorite timeline in history it is perfect for a total war game. plus the campaign map is Massive Spanning to 3 different Theater Americas, Europe and some parts of asia I hope the next game will feature the whole world Im really looking forward for Empire: Total war 2
7879	1	a	i just killed everyone, it worked, Pax Americana.
7881	1	a	I recommend this game.
7883	1	a	Few bugs here and there but still a great conquest and strategy game
7885	1	a	LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
7887	1	a	Only been playing for a few days but overall this game has out performed my expectations. Nuff said
7889	1	a	Started as le-majestic Sweden, captured most all of Eastern Europe along with Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Poland/Lithuania, Italy, and built up enough naval power to sink the whole isle of Britain itself.  Lost the campaign because I captured the whole of Prussia but was a day late to taking the Capital.
7891	1	a	I have recently completed the long campaign on the difficult setting as Britain. I have also completed the independence campaign. Although the game has been around for a long time I found it an asborbing experience to play and worth the large amount of time required to successfully complete the long campaign. Having said that there are issues that detract from the game and these probably apply to the total war series in general. Issues that have been mentioned in other reviews include the inappropriate use of bomb ketches and rocket ships in naval battles. Either they should not have been included in the game or the ability to have coastal battles and sieges in which these ships could have been used should have been developed. Puckle guns are another unit mentioned before that were not actually used in the era and therefore should probably not have been included. Going back to the idea of coastal sieges Marine units might have been an interesting addition to the game and created a bit more diversity in the battle environments.  The battle experience could have been improved by having some sort of smart setup option. I often found I laid out my armies and fleets in the same way, dependent upon the landscape. The ability of the game to remember a preferred setup style and to vary it depending on the terriain could help save a lot of repetitive setup issues. When it came to deciding battles against missmatched armies and fleets using the auto resolve often your troops ended up taking relatively heavy losses. When your fleet came up a mismatched fleet often weaker fleet would be entirely destroyed when it should probably have just been captured. It might have been good to have options on the auto-resolve to indicate tactics that your fleet or army could utilise that would lead to a lower loss of life or the capture of enemy vessels. This would cut down on the 'grind' of some of the battles.  The final issue that I felt could have been better was the 'end'. Just a fairly lame animation and that's that. What I think alot of players of the Total War series would find really interesting would be a 'history' of their campaign sort of like at the end of a Civilisation game. There could be a quick history that showed general information about your game play and other nations and a really detailed turn by turn game history that showed everything from the movement of individual units to general economic and social issues of each faction. Notable battles could highlighted and replayed and pivotal movements could be highlighted. This would be a rewarding experience for a player who has devoted a considerable length of time to playing. It could also be used as feedback for the game developers to find out how the game is played and how it could be improved. These 'histories' could even be shared and 'ranked' between players to create interest for different players to develop their tactics and strategies. Perhaps, there could also be a comparison with the actual events of the era.
7893	1	a	Great game the american campaigns are amazing and though to me atleast the RTS for the sea battle feels a bit wonky the game as a wole is a must have.
7895	1	a	PROS: Its a fun time killer and can be historical at times Rewrite history United Provinces Scotland Ireland Grenadiers United States Realistic Diplomacy (to an extent) Fun and engaging Real Time battles on land AND sea Plenty of countries to free from tyranny Wide range of units to use in battle Wide range of technology to gain an advantage over the enemy Wide range of mods to make the game better Three theaters of war Ship AI better than infantry AI Not too expensive. Pikemen DLCs add new troops which adds new fun Online play  CONS: Stupid AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI Mughal Empire Melee combat is completely one sided Melee combat can take a long time (I actually fell asleep for two hours while playing this game and my army was in Melee combat. I awoke and my army was still in melee) Real easy to go bankrupt Religion not a big factor Brigs can't beat Galleys. Brigs cant beat anything. Can't retrieve sailors in the water during ship battles DLCs cost money Online play is terrible Historically inaccurate  RATING: 9/10 Will continue to play!
7897	1	a	This game is freaking bae. Biggest all round map, all those trade ports means naval superiority is amazing. (Spanish OP early game) prefer british personally. Played and won the game on the highest difficulty. My favourite Total War game.   Obviously many bugs but hey you have mods and just awesome community for that 
7899	1	a	*2009* Oh hey, this looks interesting, i may play it for awhile, shouldn't be that time consuming.
7901	1	a	Canister shot is highly effective against a charge.   10/10 Would give those bloody b*st*rds the grape again!
7903	1	a	If you see my hours you know I've been poking around in this game for a decent while now. I recomend this game because of it's realism and replayability. Even if you take over the whole world you can restart and expect a completly different set of challenges. I hope everyone can have the same amazing, and minutely frustrating time I did with this game. Have fun, and remember never charge a square with calvary.
7905	1	a	This Total War game has the one of the largest if not the largest campane map of all the Total War games. Its also fun to watch lines of musketmen fire vollies into one another and watch huge wooden sail ships blast broadsides into one another.
7907	1	a	Great game has some lag at times but it is a good game over all only 54 hours in it but i know i will play it alot
7909	1	a	Got to say this really is all that is cracked up to be and more!!! ! I really enjoy Empire Total War it really is an amazing game. The only draw back is you cant just create spies, priest, or assassin's the rake and gentlemen when you want. The naval battles are really cool and glad they put that in the game. The differences in the trade economy is pretty cool. The shipping lanes to the other countries is very interesting. Piracy taking other peoples profit is an added bonus.
7911	1	a	Awesome graphics and realistic but turn-based gameplay are the best. Once you start playing, you can't stop. Love the sea battles (CHAINSHOT SPAMMER HERE!!); land and seige battles are intense. (Played an online seige battle with a friend on June 7, 2016, I didn't know who would win, he had KO'd all my artillery from the get-go). Addictive game altogether.
7913	1	a	Anybody likes strategy, This is THE Game
7915	1	a	Very fun strategy game happening in the time of the british empire. every big country is included in this game as im sure of. Have had fun just casually playing 1v1s with my relative.
7917	1	a	Still fun after all this time
7919	1	a	The first battles with lines of riflemen which would make Fall of the Samurai the brilliant game it is. Naval battles which were fun and challenging. An era we haven't played in too often. Great game for its time, still worth to be played.
7921	1	a	worth it. i got really annoyed after playing as the brits and getting suddenly destroyed by literally everyone on earth, but then i played as Marathas and i actually enjoyed it a lot more. great game
7923	1	a	Really fun game I really recommend this.
7925	1	a	love this game but it needs more units in game maybe just dlc but its cool MURICA!!!!
7927	1	a	Top quality game!
7929	1	a	TL,DR: If you like early modern history, or RTS games, you should definitely buy this game.  REVIEW  Empire: Total War was released in 2009 and I've been playing it since. It's an 18th-century grand strategy game similar to other games in the Total War series. This title focuses on rifle combat and line infantry; naval battles and trade and colonialization. Empire: Total War is truly a global experience as the game takes place in Europe, India and the Americas. Large battles between thousands of soldiers on land, naval battles with dozens of ships at sea and an enormous grand campaign map are the hallmarks of this game.  PROS  -Great graphics, even for today's standards -Balanced difficulty (Very Hard is quite a nearly impossible challenge; while Easy and Normal is not too difficult. I would recommend the 'Hard' difficulty setting) -Tactical gameplay is quite fun and engaging, especially at harder difficulties. The AI often notices your blunders and can counter them -Expansive game map provides hours of conquest and city-micromanagement opportunities -Diverse choice of countries to play as: For instance, Sweden and Spain provide completely different campaign experiences against different foes. The United Provinces (the Netherlands), for example, has a very strong navy and trade system but has only one province in Europe. The Ottoman Empire is probably the most fun to play as due to hardships in perhaps every category and the uniqueness of their units  CONS  -The AI is too stupid at times and they sometimes can't even respond to your attacks -The AI loves to troll you by just standing still immediately outside your cannon range. You cannot approach them without taking losses -Armed fortification battles can often be very buggy or against the player's favor, as the defending enemy will take very little losses unless you have a way to outsmart them -Almost useless Diplomacy at times. Very few opposing states will ever accept any agreement if you are at war with them, even to make peace on terms beneficial to them
7931	1	a	If you are thinking to buy this game or not, I will tell you, buy it!!, just buy it!!
7933	1	a	One of the best startegy games i have played strongly reccomend
7935	1	a	10/10 for game playing. 1/10 for no Empire Total War 2. 
746	0	a	Downfall of Creative Assembly, everybody acknowledge after time. For me its stared with Medieval II.  Shogun was a great idea with great potential. Remember how most Reviewers were asking, why CA dont do 2 games instead mixing Round Strategy and Realtime Strategy. Medieval despite the outdated tech, is still the best CA game, followed by Rome. After it, this game became junk mainstream. More animations nice lookings and more and more repressive to the strategy possibilities. In Medieval and Rome I could fight for hours, trick the enemy and win against a much stronger enemy and lose playing dumb to a much weaker. All this was cut down by a quicker and more spectacular unit porn. Shogun II was for me not the step back to the old traditions. It just gave us some more options and was not made so uninspired as Empire....  3/10
7937	1	a	If you have treied the other Total War games in the series this is an easy buy. If not the tutorial campaign will introduce you to the features and get you going on your way to fun!
7939	1	a	best total war game
7941	1	a	  Grate game i only wish there were some mods i could use
7943	1	a	I think this is the best historical strategy game. My favourite since release!
7945	1	a	This game by far had the largest potential out of any other Total War game. Its all out trade system, diplomacy system, political system, and lead way into ship battles becoming a thing in the Total War Franchise were spot on. The only thing however that leads me away from giving this game a 10/10 is the many bugs, and lack of attention CA gave it.  Many bugs such as not being able to garrison two groups of a 140 units in a building that is able to hold 1000, led to major dissapointments for the battles, and overwhelming despair of it never being fixed. Instead only one unit group could ever be stored in each building, by all means however the combat was still amazing. As for the Grand campaign, it was dissapointing not to see lands in China, Indonesia, Brazil, or Africa (besides north africa) for conquest/colonization. This after all was suppose to be the Age of Imperialism, and Age of Colonization, not just North America limted colonization.  I wait for the time where there will be a mod that not only increases the lands to be explored, conquested, and colonized; but also to make the major combat enhancments (cannons, firerate, melee, flashes, range, and etc), and bug fixes on par to its sequal expansion Napoleon Total War.   Overall I give Empire Total War a 8.6/10  (If Napoleon Total Wars combat, and bug fixes merged with an expanded map version of Empire Total War, this game would be 50/10)  This is a title that needs to be overhauled, or re-made by CA.
747	0	a	Trash, Units get stuck sit around don't fire. Terrible Campaign alliances don't matter they betray you or just do nothing when you get attacked. Building doesnt have any appeal just feels super sloppy very disappointed after playing rome total war 1. War really wanting to enjoy this time period hope in the future they do another and do it right.
7947	1	a	I love this game because you remake history.I've still have yet to take over the world (but Austria has tasted my warth).
7949	1	a	Great Game!
7951	1	a	Hours and hours of fun!
7953	1	a	1. Jumped in and played some tutorials. 2. Failed tutorials. 3. Played a land battle. 4. Mutilated by Indians since I didn't know how to control units. 5. Played a sea battle. 6. Beat Austria by barely doing anything. 7. Battled a friend 8. ez winz  9/10 would play again
7955	1	a	*Me choosing faction*  England? Already played that faction on Medieval II France? Ehh maybe next time.  Russia? No thanks.  Poland? Now that's a faction with some heart!   So begin the Musket and Tymbark Wars. 9/10
7957	1	a	why the ♥♥♥♥ is it that when i exempt a region from taxes they still start a rebelion and why do some of the empires declare war on me for no god damn region when we were allies and friendly for up to 6 ingame years
7959	1	a	I love this game, it's a great intro into the Total War series.
7961	1	a	One of my all time favourites games! Its combines the perfect amount of territory managemanet and army/fleet control. 8 years after its release still play this game in a normal basys. Strongly recommend this game to fans of the total war franchise or to someone who just likes stratagy games. Hope you have fun!
748	0	a	its a strategy game
7963	1	a	Yes although not very recent and poor graphics at some stages it can be extremely fun to go into battle
749	0	a	play it only a little, but I have a problem with blurry text and I'm not the only one - true, min resolution is 1280x1024 but it's silly for many widescreen monitors (1440x900) - no fix ever released, no possible solution ---&gt; game is practicly unplayable if i can't ever properly read the text
7965	1	a	The 18th Century was the beggining of the modern era. Guns took over, massive empires were forged, natives got screwed out of their futures. All around good times. For a Total War game, it's good, with some caveats. AI is either dumb, or cheating in battles, especially your troops AI. Friendly fire is all too common, and you sometime lose more troops from that then enemy fire. Siege battles are a joke, and troops are pretty glitchy while using fortifications. Also, do not auto-resolve battles, you will lose many more troops then you need to, especially in naval battles.  rating 8/10, would wait for a sale thou
7967	1	a	Played as the Seven Provinces. Conquered the world.  10/10. Would turn world orange again.
7969	1	a	I like to pair my Total War gaming experiences with other media set during a similar time period. Corresponding films/games that go well with this game - The Patriot, John Adams (HBO), Assassin's Creed 3/4, The PBS Documentary series about the Civil War
7971	1	a	Love this game. Over 300 hours writing this. One thing i nrecommend, save before a nation is destroyed as the nations that become liberated for the fact its destroyed may crash the game so i recommend save, if it happens then dont destroy them or take their colonies. Maybe destroy later instead. One thing as well, if its the AI destroying the nation then try and stop them by helping the nation out, minor nations have no effect apart from, what i found, the pirates if they return or the United States
7973	1	a	A older game in the Total war series that focuses on and around the time of the American Revoulution.You can play all the MAJOR nations in Europe,India and Americas however you cant play as say Denmark.Each factions units have their own uniforms and Unique units.The Units themseleves are a little repetitive many have the same faces and after a while it gets boring to even look at the units.Cannons while deadly cant seem to hit the broad side of a barn with a big target on it.The campaign in this game is Average and dare i say Poor due to the fact its really just a Sandbox mode with Narratives and quests and did i mention theres only FOUR chapters?Five counting the US grand Campain(Us sandbox).Naval combat is decent and theres quite a few decent Mods out there if you want a good mod look up Darthmod.Overall its quite good for its age and i do recommend it.
7975	1	a	By a mile my favourite Total War Game, virtually no glitches or any issues of that kind after years of being played by people.   Nothing hugely complicated or overwhelming about it but can be difficult on the higher settings. Just a shame it doesnt have a multiplayer but its an old game so nevermind.   I would 100% advise to anyone who enjoys strategy games.
7977	1	a	Very fun and great game play
7979	1	a	Yes great game you need a fast com and graphics board and it still crashs takes ages to install but appart from that its fun ,cool graphics, sound, AI is good could be better but fun over all.
7981	1	a	This is a good game for reenacting battles from many wars fought during the 18th century. 10/10 would revolutionary war again. only negative is the Horrible musket sounds.
7983	1	a	'I'vv hadddd the time of my lifffffe and I owe it all to youuuuuuu'
7985	1	a	hands down one of the best games in its class keep coming back to it love the naval combat love the era if you havnt played it give it a chance if you like these type of game
7987	1	a	A wonderful taste of Grand Strategy RTS, and a wonderful entry title to the Total War franchise  If either of these interest you then definitely buy this game, it'll be worth every dollar
7989	1	a	Just Fanatastic!
7991	1	a	This Total War game is likely my favorite of the entire series. Any lover of this period of warfare should pick this game up.
7993	1	a	It's a realy good army controller however if u want multiplayer it sorely lacks in online players at certain parts of the day highly recommended
7995	1	a	Grab a mod to unlock more factions and this game opens up in a completely new way. Your units may be inferior in some respects but the game is already easy enough, so welcome the challenge :)
7997	1	a	Great game! Very accurate historical events. Awesome gameplay and factions to use.
7999	1	a	A haiku summing up my feels on Empire:  Ahh, Enlightenment; Empires, colonies, trade; But no bug testing.  (As a German major who's all about Enlightenment-era Europe, I was also all about a grand strategy game that highlighted this period of history. However, with how buggy and broken this game was on release (and how even now, getting regiments across bridges is enough to want to rip your hair out), any grandness Empire: TW could've had was then crushed by Napoleon then after, which was a lot better polished and optimized. Though it's nice CA learned from their mistakes by Napoleon's release, but a shame Empire had to be a casualty to it in the meantime. I still recommend this game, however, as its low cost and third-party mods make the experience a bit more bearable.)
8001	1	a	When I first got this game I was told it was a waste of money. This is simply not true. It says i only have 46 hours but when i was without internet i played this game almost 24/7 for 2 years. It is such a replayable game and I highly recommend it to any fan of RTS or even Turn Based.
755	0	a	16,5gb of a game with dlcs, plays worse than Medieval. Much worse than Rome 1 or Shogun 2.  TL:DR: I don't know how anyone who played Rome 1/Shogun 2 could possibly recommend this.  Game is so clunky and broken in so many ways (cannons, walls, ships, results calculation, etc) that the only thing actually being good is advanced (?) trade.  Game is completely BORING to play, units upkeep costs are waaay to high (like seriously, this affects both player and AI).  AI is non-existant. Autoresolve can have your 5 units of charging cavalry loose agains two units of pure artillery. Or a fleet of sloop can loose against half a fleet of brigs. This happens. Graphics is extremely demanding for my pc, looking poorly, sometimes freezing when I select large unit stack etc.  AVOID!!
8003	1	a	10/10 game for me. best total war i've played
8005	1	a	&gt;Download darthmod &gt;Play as Native muricans &gt;Take over the Muricas &gt; Don't convert ports (Can only build one type of ships of natives) &gt;Build major fleet of screaming scalping warriors &gt;Invade EU &gt;Now i won &gt; Half the world is Cherroke &gt;the rest fears is, Finnaly shows us respect &gt;Now who is taking land from who &gt; Best game NA
8007	1	a	Empire Total War is one of the best strategy games in my opinion, the battles are intense and it requires a lot of strategy and is a challenge that includes is a lot of detail included throughout, like most games in the Total War series. 9/10   Amazing!
8009	1	a	one of the best
8011	1	a	Epic game! 9/11 harambe would be proud, and look at my hours on record.
8013	1	a	One of my favorite Total War games, next to the first Rome game. Some aspects of the battles can definitely be improved, but the campaign strategy aspect of the game is nearly perfect. It is always a challenge for me, depending on what country I am playing as.
8015	1	a	Definitely one of my favorite Total War games. I highly recommend Darthmod in addition- Empire is known for its epic scope, Napoleon for its polish, and Darthmod makes Empire a bit more smooth.
8017	1	a	It helps me vent my imperialistic urges
8019	1	a	I think this is the funniest Total War game, they ever have made, it just gives so much more play time, with three continents, and 9 faction (plus a questline). The diplomacy in this game is much better than in the other of their games (maybe on the same stage as Rome total war 1). and the time period is just the most exiting of them all! I will with no doubt say that this is a epic game!!!
8021	1	a	An excellent look at what 18th-early 19th century warfare. Unlike most games, which are mostly melee, this game relies mostly on ranged tactics, which is just how I like it.  The only thing that sucks is how buildings are spread out around the regions, giving enemies a good way to cripple the economy.
8023	1	a	I have 400 hours on this game and I still want to put on more. My favorite part is when you have to fight Venice over and over again because you can't take that territory and suddenly their one region fields 15k troops but not before all you provinces revolt.
8025	1	a	Been playing this for a couple of years and have logged around 350 hours - still love it to death. Get a good mod (I use Darthmod Ultimate Commander) and this is all the strategy game you'll ever need.
8027	1	a	Global commerce and colonial expansion. Some find the campaign map unwieldy, but I fell in love. I'm a micromanager at heart and love pulling the strings of a global empire.   The battles are beautiful. Linear warfare fits the Total War engine very well. One of the better games in the series.
8029	1	a	everything has been already said about this series of games - just great!!!
8031	1	a	why there is no workshop for this game?
8033	1	a	IK you are probably thinking do i get Napoleon TW or Empire TW. I come to help you comrade. I like them both, but they are different. If you like single player better then I'd prefer Empire because you can go to india and the americas. Napoleon TW only has the Europe theater and i personnally feel that the single player is lacking what Empire had. For mulityplayer, definitley get Napoleon TW. All in all i prefer Empire Total war, but thats just a bears opinion.
8035	1	a	Nice Total War
8037	1	a	very good game, would recmond to any one
8039	1	a	Best total war ever.
8041	1	a	tw games rule
8043	1	a	Empire Total War... Europe War with Battle Ships and Guns powder
8045	1	a	What can i say, old time classic, a very good game!
8047	1	a	I love this game
8049	1	a	13.5/20
8051	1	a	&gt; Start new game as Russia &gt; Invade Poland-Lithuania &gt; Invasion's going well &gt; Prussia invades Poland &gt; Warsaw falls, relations with Prussia are increasing &gt; Out of nowhere Prussia invades me with several armies &gt; After several bad decisions I lose 10/10 would imitate WW2 again
8053	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME best strategy game of all time!!!!!
8055	1	a	great game ton of fun
8057	1	a	One of my most-played games here on Steam and still my favourite Total War game of the lot. Especially with mods (specifically DarthMod).  The scale that Empire: Total War attempts to tackle is unmatched in the series. The execution may be flawed, but it's still a pretty good attempt.  It makes me wish for a collaboration between Paradox and CA: the former tackling the grand strategy element (what w/ their experience w/ games like Europa Universalis), the latter handling the real-time tactical battles.
758	0	a	How do I even play this game? It exects you to just jump in and control everything, there's no tutorial on controlling the nations and I'm garbage at this game.
8059	1	a	Still one of the most entertaining Total war games, for its size, and gameplay, sure sometimes buggy but most of the time great material to burn through days of gameplay, especially in vombination with Darthmod etc...
8061	1	a	The best strategy game by turns I've ever played, I like Age of Empires, but this game is way better and more realistic.
8063	1	a	Awesome game! I never get tired of playing it.
8065	1	a	This game has been out for some time and evy time i play it, it just gets better and better even thought there are some AI improvements they need to be desparetly made i still love the game and what potential it still has
8067	1	a	IMO the best total war game cant beat the scale and really love the time period
8069	1	a	One of the best Total War games. I have played 297 hours of this game, and it still is fun,
8071	1	a	Could've been one of the greatest of all time.
8073	1	a	The classic 'just 5 more minutes' game. You know, just 5 more minutes to take revenge on allied Prussia who broke our alliance and attacked my territory, then to eliminate all of the puppets who turned against me for taking revenge on Prussia. (No, it's never managed in 5 minutes)
8075	1	a	This is one of my favorite games of all time. I love this game.
8077	1	a	10/10 would make america great again :)
8079	1	a	Nothing else stood the test of time
8081	1	a	 Amateur Total War Fan's review
8083	1	a	i like walking the piles of bodies after a battle. 10/10
8085	1	a	The best stragety game ever made. You can control cannons, caverly, infintry, genarals, and more. You are the commander and you can control your troops and do tactics to achive victory on the battle ground. The game is so relistic that it looks like you are acually in with the rest of the men in the unites.
8087	1	a	It's been 2 years since I bought this game. Didn't play it until just a week ago, and I love it.
8089	1	a	Very fun game. One of the best strategy games out there. Naval and land wars which make it cooler.
8091	1	a	Completed my first campaign it only took 230 hours! And still having a blast.
8093	1	a	This is still one of my favorite total war games of all time. Total war with guns, what is not to like? 4 stars * It lost a star due to it being a bug ridden mess.
8095	1	a	*Starts the American Independence Campaign* First battle with George Washington in 1750's I destroy the enemy force but they have one cannon unit left. I charge everyone head on at cannon unit, cannon manages to fire once. Cannon ball directly hits George Washington killing him 20 years before American revolution. 10/10 would destroy Americas hopes before revolution again.
8097	1	a	'WHAT 15 HOURS!!!!!!!!!! Ow well at least the world is finaly mine!' this is one of the best harcore statigy games in the world todate
8099	1	a	Very fun game. One of the best strategy games out there. Naval and land wars which make it cooler.

8107	1	a	'WHAT 15 HOURS!!!!!!!!!! Ow well at least the world is finaly mine!' this is one of the best harcore statigy games in the world todate
8109	1	a	A really solid game with so much replay value! I recommend you to get Darth Mod for even more units and stuff to make the game a little better and deeper. 8/10 - Would want a multiplayer campaign
8111	1	a	This game was vilified when it first came out, right after Medieval II. Now we all wish CA would still make games like this.   PS Play with Darthmod or don't play at all, IMO.
8113	1	a	Another great game. I play this through to the end, take a couple of months break and then start again. Different every time but challenging and enjoyable each time.
8115	1	a	where do i find mods for this
8117	1	a	Absolutely the most awesome wargame and strategy game ever! Totally brilliant!!!
8119	1	a	Better than the reviews ever stated
8121	1	a	This game it's a nuke by that I mean it is so epic that whenever you want to play it,you just want to do it from start to the end .
8123	1	a	By far the best of the Total War Series. Ambitious, beautiful and almost limitless replayability. A solid game and I wish the ones which came after it were at the scale of this one.
8125	1	a	The Marathans stopped trading with me, so I went in and conquered them. 10/10 great Imperialism simulator.
8127	1	a	I have played TW series since the first shogun I have played every song one this is probably the best definitely in my top 3  10/10 would pillage the world again
8129	1	a	Played this a couple of years ago closer to release didn't like it and quickly gave up. Then i gave it another chance like two years ago and man has it grown on me. Best sea battles and world map of any total war game, only thing i didn't like was all the land units for every nation are much the same which can get very boring in a long campagin. Everything else i can think of like diplomacy and economy etc very solid.
8131	1	a	This game is truely epic. You have the ability to rule three theatres of war and four trade areas as well. You move through the builing and governing of an empire. It is one of the best in the Total War series which is saying a great deal!
8133	1	a	It does have a few bugs here and there, but the gigantic size of the campaign map is a good enough reason to play this game. Also you get ship battles and improved trading. Napoleon total war has a little bit better battle system and visuals, but this makes it all even with the grand campaign.
8135	1	a	If, like me, you are partial to history, especially the history of the Age of Limited Warfare, then Empire: Total War is the perfect game for you. There is immense amusement to be made, re-writing the history of Europe, and the game world has a wonderful periphery, in which all manner of delightful and unexpected things happen, like the Pope conquering the Ottoman Empire. It manages to be an excellent strategy game, with levels of increasing complexity for those who would delve into them, but also a simple interface, and wonderfully easy, shallower format that allows someone to ease into the game. I would highly recommend this to any fan of the 18th Century, or any fan of the Total War games.
8137	1	a	great game with an amazing campaigne but the campaigne can be better if they added africa south america and asia as maps were you can colonize and conquer the units need more diversity the line infantry all have the same i con just different colour sceme more units is a must they need to add more artillery aswell as faces all units have pracktically the same faces 
8139	1	a	In this game i can occupied, contorl every region and change history of wold in 18th century
8141	1	a	This game is addicting once you start, especially if you like strategy games and controlling units to fight other units.
8143	1	a	Best total war game 11/9
8145	1	a	Although sometimes buggy, it's still a great TW game. The fact that you can play in America, Europe, India, Noth Africa and the Middle East might seem overwhelming at first, but you'll soon be immersed into the action. My 2nd favourite TW game, after Rome 1. I'd give Empre a solid 1763/1776.

8149	1	a	The variety of Factions and Historic Empires. Pluses prior to Mods added to this with reasonable DLC. The youtube community and the CA DEV TM are excellant people . Downside was the age of this game in Engine years it can cunk even on robust systems. The Micro or add on DLC Campaigns were consistant to what we expected from past CA fare. Have started with the Wonderful Shogun. As a History buff and Studier We enjoyed growing with this Historic flavoured Sim of ancent life. In cultures the degree of detail in uniforms sound and leaving the blood packs optional all added to a experiance  that was positive and not too complicated. Sometimes replay is better given a break to refreash and view others works in the Art of War. Some AI gripes in other Total Wars like the Greek for Rome II but the map styles are nice giving your immersion a chance to see new cities left out of the origional was nice. Wish for a ETW II Victorian includign Asia and Western America =SB=^-^
8151	1	a	Great game with strong historical background that is well integrated to the action. The wide variety of strategy that you can use makes this game interesting to play and replay. The battles keep a dynamic part in this game to make a good balance between pure strategy and action.
8153	1	a	Best played with Darthmod. Completely new game almost comparable with Napoleon total war
8155	1	a	10/10 would make America great again
8157	1	a	Empire TW is one of those games that no matter how much time you have invested into it you can always start playing it again.
8159	1	a	If you like STR, you HAVE to pocess all the Sega games (from this one to the CoH ones)
8161	1	a	This game definatly shows its age but is still in my opinion the best Total War game to date. It is nearly impossible to get bored from this game as well since the map is huge and diverse; and with amazing mods like Darthmod the battles look and feel realistic and epic. A must play for fans of history and/or strategy games alike

8165	1	a	Great game love it enough said
8167	1	a	its cool brah
8169	1	a	Its a decent enough game, massive overdose of content and the shooting doesent really work in it.  Buy it if you have plenty of time on your hands.
8171	1	a	One of the best Total war games
8173	1	a	ok this is my favorite TBRTS i like it more than napoleon or shogun u must test it....i realy like the american campain! ( 1 reason that i realy like it is the deplomacy...far the best of all total warr...)
8175	1	a	Ended too soon.
760	0	a	everytime im i start a new campaign it crashes just after it loads, i used to play this game and i loved it, now the longest i can play is 1 min because of the crashes
8177	1	a	Started a game as the Marathas ---&gt; removed Mughals and Europeans from Glorious India. Invaded the Middle-East, took out the Ottomans with Russian help.  D-day into Iberia just for the giggles. My general: 'Our artillery shall blot out the sun' Spanish guy: 'Then we shall fight in the shade' My General: 'Our artillery shall blot out the shade' Spanish guy: 'F**k'  7,34/10 Would conquer America as the true Indians again.
8179	1	a	I have played Medieval, Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon, Shogun 2, Rome 2 and Attila Total War series and ETW remain my favorite. This is due to the fact that ETW has a vast map with a lot of factions to play (with mods of course). Such setting allows all kinds of possible alternative history. I am now playing as Mexico and about to colonize Mysore!
8181	1	a	This Game is Awsome I love it and have 42 hours of playtime!
8183	1	a	This game stole 16 days of my life.
761	0	a	Game is fun but keeps crashing and is laggy to ♥♥♥♥, massive joke ♥♥♥♥ you needs fixing
8185	1	a	this game is amazing
8187	1	a	I have about 200 hours on this game and its still fun, if they would update the game I would balance the line units but thats it oveerall good game
8189	1	a	The game is kind of complicated of how to do things, but the battles are fun.
762	0	a	Game is fun but keeps crashing and is laggy to ♥♥♥♥, massive joke ♥♥♥♥ you needs fixing
8191	1	a	Just finished a Short Campaign after not touching this game for several years..  Like back then I couldn't stop playing till 5 am even with a workday the same morning. It's pure gold!
8193	1	a	You look for perfect stratregy game?Well this game is for you.     ---------------------&gt;BEST STRATREGY GAME&lt;------------------------
8195	1	a	You will learn how to say: 'Yes', 'Ok', 'I will do it' and 'Attack', in basiclly any language.
8197	1	a	Pros: Excellent strategy game for its time and still today. In general, much more refined and fun gameplay compared to previous AoEs with more of an emphasis on combat, rather than micromanaging villagers. Still has decent graphics even by today's standards.  Cons: The French.  11/10 would buy again.
8199	1	a	with 745.9 hours of gameplay i can safely say this game is worth every penny  EDIT: I have 4 more hours.
8201	1	a	Age of Empires makes a comeback by jumping forward to the Imperial Era. Cannons, muskets, armed cavalries, large vessels and more cannons present a change of pace from the old sword-and-shield Age of Empires II. The third instalment of the franchise also introduces trading routes, a set of locations that you have to capture and control by building trading posts on it, reinforcing your income and XP gain. You can order shipments of goods from your mainland at intervals of time and befriend local indigenous tribes.  In a sense, there are plenty of new features to keep long time fans of Age of Empires interested, while retaining the same core gameplay. Build stuff, gather stuff, advance Ages, kill baddies. Only this time, with more cannons.
8203	1	a	I am a big fan of the AOE series, and history. This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as the a musketeer would take up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the US and even the Great silk road in Asia.   Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.  If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.
8205	1	a	You will learn how to say: 'Yes', 'Ok', 'I will do it' and 'Attack', in basiclly any language.
8207	1	a	A benchmark RTS development which still exceeds most games in it's genre. Almost 10 years since I began playing this game &amp; even longer for earlier franchise releases.
8209	1	a	This is a very fun game to play with big, or small groups of friends. You get to build your nation from scratch and then destroy your friend's crap! :D I wish more of my friends could play this. It's a shame it's so expensive...
8211	1	a	Yeah... I guess it's pretty decent.
8213	1	a	An old classic that i have always enjoyed. There are many nations to play, each with their own special units. a real time stradegy game where you upgrade through the ages, offering better units and upgrades. You can fight with humans or with computer players. The best part of the game by far is the battles. Huge battles with infantry, calvary and cannons, War will be every where and dead bodies will rittle the bafflefied. A must play if you like RTS games
8215	1	a	i think aoe 3 should have a workshop to create more stuff
8217	1	a	This game is:  10% luck 20% skill  15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase this game
8219	1	a	My Aztec navy destroyed the Spanish and British fleets  10/10
8221	1	a	Looking for 3 more people to play with tonight. I will buy you the game. Already got 5 people. Great game
8223	1	a	My all time favourite RTS game, I got this game for christmas in retail version back in 2005 and its the only christmas present I can remember even now in 2015.   I really love and recommend it.
8225	1	a	Do you like video games? Do you like RTSs? Do you like not having to have 300 apm to keep a constant stream of resources coming in? Then you will like AoE 3. If you don't go hardcore or of Asian descent and play strategy games like a casual (like me) then you will also like this game. What I mean is that the macro from Age of Empires II was VERY watered down in AoE 3. Sure you still need some form of it like all RTSs, but the amount has dropped very much so. And I LOVE gunpowder units. Nothing is more satisfying then seeing 100+ musketiers poppin caps in each other like this is Chicago.   The addition of Home City shipments is another feature that I like. Basically you choose around 20 shipments (they are cards that you put into a deck and you pick new cards everytime you level your home city) gain experience from various actions and once you accumulate enough you gain the ability to call in a shipment to your town center. Cards are also Age related and most can only be used once. The cards can range from calling in military units, villagers, economic shipments and buildings, and upgrades for many different things. And some cards affect all your allies. There is a lot of different strats you can go with a deck.  As I mentioned earlier you have Home Cities for each civ. Basically when you first start the game you choose which Civilization you want to be, then you choose your home city name and your explorer name ( you can put any name you want for both, great feature ) then you go into a game. You gain exp as you finish games, gaining levels for your city. Then you can unlock new cards. Some cards are locked until later levels ( it goes something like 10&gt;25&gt;40 I think) but from what I have since they aren't that much better, still useful though. If you want to play a different civ you have to make another home city for them and can also name that anything you want, along with the explorer, starting back at level one ( Unless you play the DLC, for some odd reason you start at level 10 with 10 unlocks. So just play the Asian DLC since it has everything for the other one and the base game.) Each Civ has different cards available at the start and to unlock although about half are universal.  Onto the gameplay it is mostly the same as AoE 2. With the addition of Trade Routes and Native camps (which supply extra resources and unlocks special respectively) it adds some degree of map control. There probably was already map control on AoE 2 but I know little of how the meta is for it. If there was I'm sure trade routes and native camps add even more since the extra resources are a huge bonus ( They start off giving only Exp and can be upgrade 3 times with the last being a train, another feature I like. And the free exp is HUGE to getting early home shipment points) and natives can harass early on. Natives also don't add to pop limit but you can only train a certain amount. Having more than half of all the trade posts and native camps gives you the option to start a Trade monopoly victory, which gives you victory in 5 minutes if they don't destroy any trade posts/native camps, helps if the enemy is turtling hard. You also can only build one castle and thats from a shipment you get (Russians can build more I believe). And if the wagon it starts off as gets destory you don't get another. Stone was also removed as a resource. Also, cannons and muskets. Pretty much the two man things you will build, or at least for me. Still plenty of archers, cavalry, swordmen, pikemen, etc. A lot of civs have more than one special unit, and they aren't built from the castle only. The population cap is set at 200 and that has mixed feelings but I'm fine with it. The graphics are great even though I run it on low. Haven't played the campaign nor the multiplayer, just skirmishs.  Overall, a great game and a must buy for any RTS fan. Even if it is slightly watered down from AoE 2 the new additions to it and time setting are amazing, great gameplay, and good graphics.  40 dollars though? Damn, definitely worth at at any sales price, but who even buys triple A games over 30? Still worth it at 40.
8227	1	a	I made women hunt and cut trees, while men worked at the farm.  10/10
8229	1	a	When I first got this game 10 years ago on DVD I fell in love with it from its gameplay system to its story. This game is what introduced me to the RTS genre and it is because of this game that RTS games are what mostly fill my steam library. Overall with its two amazing dlcs i think this game is well deserved of an extremely good review.
8231	1	a	The original Age of Empires packed a stunning visual punch and backed it up with solid gameplay. Back at a time where most strategy games were chunky and 2D, the first Age game pulled aside the curtain to reveal a world that was sunny, animated, colorful and lifelike. Strategy games were never the same. Age of Empires III presents a similar leap forward for real-time strategy fans. As Half-Life 2 did for first-person shooters, AoE III shows just how inspiring these games can be when lovingly crafted with outstanding artistry and solid gameplay fundamentals.   Age of Empires III doesn't redefine real-time strategy gameplay. You're still scurrying to collect more resources than your opponents and rushing to field a giant army, and the game still rewards frantic clicking and unit management. But the presentation is unmatched, and even though the game is rooted in RTS conventions, there are enough new elements and strategic variations here to addict even grizzled veterans. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. And if you've never played a real-time game before, this is the place to start.  Graphically, the engine that powers Age of Empires III has a laundry list of the latest graphics technology: real-time shadows, high dynamic range lighting, you name it. There's even bump-mapping on the barrels of the cannons. But the real impressive thing about the technology isn't that it's there, it's that you don't notice it. From the moment your Home City first appears on the menu screen, or a new map loads up to reveal pale grey waters lapping quietly against rocky New England shores, you become lost in the game world. The latest in technology is coupled with truly beautiful art.  Age III pulls out all the stops to depict the sweeping majesty of the old west or the unspoiled beauty of the colonial-era Americas. One of the single-player campaign cutscenes, done in the game engine, pans across rolling hills of golden grass while huge herds of buffalo amble along like waves of water. Another level depicts a small Caribbean port picking up the pieces after a devastating hurricane, with citizens milling about amidst wrecked ships and broken docks. Yet another level has you picking your way through a dense swamp looking for the ruins of Spanish treasure ships half-buried in the mud and dripping with gold doubloons. You're never lacking for eye candy.  The music is equally impressive. Done in full orchestra, it moves effortlessly from majestic scores highlighting the beauty of the landscape to pounding battle drums accenting the fury of battle.   Of course, the combat is equally spectacular. The goal of the game is to devastate your opponents, and said devastation is accompanied by deeply satisfying images of destruction. A large part of this has to do with the real physics incorporated onto the game engine. You can feel the impact when a cannonball shatters into a wooden frontier building, breaking it into pieces that fly off in macabre arcs. Smoke billows from muskets, cannons leap back as they expel their fury, building spires burst into flame and collapse into themselves, and the masts of ships crash to the deck as the vessel shudders with the impact of enemy fire. Every game of Age of Empires III drips with spectacle.  Age III simulates colonization, meaning that the town you build in the game can request 'shipments' from your Home City. You gain new shipments by earning experience, and you have a set list of things that you can send over. This has a profound impact on your strategy. Do you send over economic resources early, to give your town a leg up on the competition? Or do you send over tons of military units, so that you can field an advanced army while your neighbors are still building up? Shipments add a lot to the game by giving you more strategic possibilities, and by giving you incentive to rapidly earn experience. They really reward players for going out and making things happen around the map.   Every map is also dotted with Native American villages or trade routes that can be built up by your colony. Controlling a trading post gives you free experience or resources whenever a trade cart comes by, whereas Native American villages can provide you with inexpensive military units or technology upgrades. Controlling these points on the map gives you a major edge over the long term. As a result, it's a rush to be the first to locate these points, and they are always hotly contested. Battles usually play out as a series of skirmishes across the map before big conflicts rage at the town centers.  Finally, Age of Empires III adds the 'Home City' concept. Outside of the real-time portion of the game, you can create a Home City representing the world power that's supplying your colonies. Your Home City has a level - like an RPG character - representing how experienced it is. As you earn experience playing the game your city will 'Level up' and you can choose new abilities for it, in effect deciding what kinds of shipments you'd like to send to your colonies. The decision about what kinds of upgrades to make to your city is agonizing and has a tangible impact on the main game. It's also fun just to level up, develop, and customize your own personal city. One nice side effect here is that, even if you get totally ♥♥♥-whupped in a multiplayer game, you probably still earned a lot of experience to use to develop your city. This concept works great all around and really contributes to the game.  The single-player campaign is divided into three acts representing three generations of the same family. Picking up where Age of Kings left off, the lead character in the first campaign is a Knight adventuring in the New World in search of a lost treasure. Said treasure impacts his whole family line, as depicted in Act II, a rip-roaring Davy-Crockett style adventure starring his Grandson. Act III picks up two generations later, featuring a wild west romp involving railroads, the Mexican war, and a quest into the Amazon jungles before the family finally finds closure. As with the other production values of the game, the writing is solid and the voice acting is great.   There's a good variety of missions in the single-player campaign, from protecting a stronghold until help arrives to building a railroad line to battling pirates along a series of islands. None of the individual scenarios have you doing things that hadn't been done in other RTS games, but the real magic is in the gameplay, which allows you to develop a different Home City for each act and tackle each scenario differently.   Truly hardcore strategy gamers might find lots of nitpicks in Age of Empires III. It's difficult to unload transport ships, healers have to be micro-managed or they'll charge into combat, and there aren't a lot of options for customizing your hotkeys. Artillery units on occasion can't decide to fire or pack up to move. But the important thing is that none of these little problems really impacts the core game.   Age of Empires III is an absolutely fantastic title with superb graphics and tight gameplay. Single-player or multiplayer, no matter what your skill, you'll get hours of joy out of this sucker online or off. Age of Empires III may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we'll be comparing games to this for years. Shoulder your musket and pony up: this one's a real trip.
8233	1	a	I've played the AOE series since they first came out of hiding, AOE 3 is not the best in the series (2nd is without doubt) but it is still a great buy and offers good fun for you money.
8235	1	a	First played when I was 11, and here I am at 22 still playing. Really wish there was a workshop though.
8237	1	a	Still waiting Microsoft Studios announcing AOE IV
8239	1	a	Great game! I hope microsoft is now developing AoE 4 !
8241	1	a	Well, a third part for Age of Empires. What to expect of it?  If you have never played the first two parts of AoE, here you'll get a little summary: Age of Empires I and II were defining new standards for the RTS-genre when they came out. Not as fast-paced as Starcraft or WarCraft, but with more strategical Depth and more focus on the organization of your camp and with a build-in history-part wich made the game even a little educational without decreasing the fun of the gameplay. You always could choose from many different cultures which had some units and technology in common, but some unique units and cultural advantages and disadvantages.  Now, what is different in AoE III? First of all, after AoE I playing in antique times and AoE II playing in Medieval times up to the discovery of the new world, AoE III consequently plays in times of the colonization of America and the civil war. Like AoE I &amp; II, AoE III contains many true historical events, locations and persons, but unlike both prequels, the main storyline of the campaigns is highly fictional so that it might be difficult to tell which events in the game truely happend and which are made up. The main storyline of the campaign is about a sect which tries to find and conquer the fountain of youth in the new world and a family which is bound by fate to stop them. On their journeys they encounter many historical persons like Georg Washington or Bolivar, but most of the game is about hunting down the sect. So the game is far less educational then the previous ones.  The second big difference is that the cultures do not longer have most techs and units in common but every nation has their own tech tree. Some things of course still are open to every culture but the differences between the cultures are far bigger then before. This isn't much of a problem because you can still tell the strengths and weaknesses of an unfimilar unit very fast, but it is more difficult then before to play a new nation.  And the there are the RPG-elements. Not only do you have imortal hero-units (like in Age of Mythology) which can only be knocked unconscious and stand up again if no more enemy units are around, you will also play random maps with a 'hometown' which can level up between games and send you support if you collect enough experience by surviving a certain time, killing enemy units or building your camp. Although this may increase the motivation to play more random maps they removed the option to play a random culture, which I really loved in AoE I &amp; II.  The AIs are weaker then in AoE II which is good for beginners but a little disappointing for more expert players. The balancing is also worse. There are some strategies to break the game. A pack of at least 20 osman heavy bombards, for example, is almost invincible. No AI-player ever was able to beat me if I got that far.  With the complete Collection, you will also get the two Add-Ons: The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties.  The War Chiefs adds playable Native American Tribes (Without this Add-On they are only available as some sort of mercenaries if you build trading posts near their villages witch appear randomly on random maps). Although playing a native american culture is a very wellcome change and a challenge, it is clearly unbalanced. Those cultures are given many new and unique techniques like sending settlers to a totem and dance to do rites which give you advantages like faster ressources or stronger soldiers, they still desperatly lack heavy siege weaponary. Native american soldiers are only strong in large nummers and will have to attack early to not get overwhelmed by superior firepower of other nations. The Add-On also adds two campaigns which complete the storyline of the original game campaign by filling gaps and finishing the somehow open story. The focus, of course, is more on the war of the native americans against the europeans and so it is no true surprise that you will have to face general Custer at wounded Knee. Still the two new campaigns are much more shallow...  The Asian Dynasties finally adds some civilizations from Asia like the Indians and the Chinese. The storyline of the new campaigns has nothing to do with the story of the original campaign. The Indian campaign for example takes place around the fight for independence in India and the chinese campaign describes the discovery of the american continent by a chinese admiral which might have taken place (or maybe not) long before Columbus was born.  Overall AoE III: Complete Collection is a decent RTS game with some unique features, but if you were a big fan of AoE I &amp; II you might be disappointed because it is a really different game then what you are used to. Still it is worth a try. If you have never played AoE I or II, but you like RTS games, you should definitly try this one.

Unleash the samurai-pacolypse. Win.
8245	1	a	One of the best RTS games ever!
8247	1	a	My Favorite RTS Game, Great Story and Gameplay, WORTH the purchase!
8249	1	a	This is a very solid game. I was expecting this game to be absolutely awful, however, in playing it and completing all three campaigns on normal in about 19 hours, it was an enjoyable game. The campaign is above-average, and the variety of the campaign is solid, yet it can become repeatitive, in my opinion.  The AI is very solid, they act like they know what to do. This, with the gameplay, cooperates and makes it a very fun experience for strategy gamers because the gameplay, is as normal with Age of Empire series, is great.  The graphics are dated, however they are not all that bad.  People still play multiplayer, and MP is very fun, as it has modded modes, to just normal gameplay, so the community is not dead.  Overall, I would recommend this game to any strategy fan. The overall experience is worth the price tag.  8/10.  ----  Thanks for reading my review!

8251	1	a	Age of Empires 3. An amazing RTS taking place in the 'New World' during the colonial age. Great game play that keeps you entertained for hours, continuously coming back wanting more!  Pros: -Great game play, keeping you entertained for hours.  -Has funny and entertaining cheats, like 'tuck tuck tuck' which allows you to spawn in a huge monster truck. That will drive over anyone or anything, creating global havoc.  -Has a large supply of maps, each map making you have to adjust your strategic plans to win.  -You get all the DLC's, adds more to the game, civilizations, maps and more!  Cons: -Dying online community and online support, servers can get high amounts of lag. Servers will go offline sometimes even for an entire day.  -Franchise has been disbanded, meaning no more support. No updates, no fixing current glitches.  -Population cap reaches only 200, meaning that your stuck fighting smaller battles.   I would purchase this game on sale, it's worth to get the game. Just not at full price. Overall I will give an overall positive review: 8.3/10
8253	1	a	Age of Empires 3 (AOE3) will always be my favourite RTS of all time. I have played this game since 2008 and on my disc copy (actually 3 disc copies lol) I would say I have played around 1500 hours or so total.   The Campaign : The campaign is not a hugely different playstyle from skirmish or multiplayer but it allows you to feel more like you're involved with the people and characters than usual which definitely makes the campaign worth playing through. Each expansion has a separate campaign and I remember them being highly entertaining and interesting each to their own. The campaigns also allow you to use civs not playable in any other game mode.   Map Editor : Not something I played around with too much, but it was fun to just create giant battles, or create your own scenarios and historical events.   Civilizations : The civilizations are really interesting. So interesting, that my interest in European, Native American, and Asian history are based from this game. I play this game as an excuse for studying for my history tests but I can't say that it helped with much more than trivia-like questions. Anyways, This game makes every civilization slightly different from each other (The War Chiefs and Asians are much different respectifully though) and every one is recognizable by not only building styles but troops as well. Each nation is given at least one troop that is unique to their civ. In the original there is 8 European nations (Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Ottoman Empire) with War Chiefs, 3 Native American tribes were added (Iroquois, Sioux, Aztec) allowing 11 total playable nations, and finally with Asian Dynasties, 3 more were added (Japan, China, India), with a total of 14 playable civilizations . Apart from the 3 civs that are just a little bit better than the rest (You'll know soon enough), it is pretty balanced when playing online (IF playing with someone with similar experience).   Multiplayer : AOE3 was slowly getting weaker with age a few years back but with the game being more widely sold on steam, I feel the community has a chance to bounce back. Usually when I go on, there are anywehre from 600 - 1000 people on at a time. This doesn't count the community that play on places like GameRanger and other programs like it. Don't get discouraged by people baiting new players into their games when they are veteran players. Host a game and name it something welcoming new players, read the ranks of the people who join, to make sure the game will be fair and welcoming to you if you are new. Or join another low ranked players game or grab a buddy or two and practice between you all. I would recommend being able to beat Hard or Expert computers before playing online, but of course, it is your choice. Multiplayer is the best place to play, practice, and have a competitive and some-what stressful game of AOE3. :)   Graphics : Honestly, in my opinion, the graphics are spectacular for their time and do not look anywhere near 'bad' even in today's time. Of course they aren't great for today's standards but they aren't awful enough to turn you away. I actually find them quite nice and I am more than satisfied watching the ships travel the oceans, or seeing the parrots flying through the rainforests. The loading screens are really nice too, all 3 games have different styles. For example in Asian Dynasties there is one loading screen with the Indian Emperor riding on an elephant with the troops behind them. Or the Japanese loading screen with the beautiful Torii Gates. In War Chiefs, one screen is the Aztec emperor on top of a temple with his arms up with the people looking up to him from the ground. This game sparks not only interest, but imagination, its amazing!   Soundtrack : The soundtrack is phenominal! I absolutely love the theme song of each game and I find myself testing my opera skills most times I play this game. The music is great, intense, and is fitting to the epic introduction to the game or the conclusion to the massive multiplayer game you just finished.   Opening : The opening to each expansion has a really cool video based on the game. The War Chiefs has the European explorers searching the forest and them being ambushed by the Native troops. It's epic, and amazing to watch from time to time before jumping into the game! I recommend watching all 3 intros so I'll let you watch to find out what they're like!   Extra Features : Unlike previous installments to the franchise (AOE1, AOE2, Age of Mythology), AOE3 introduces cards, card decks, city levels, city customization, explorer naming, and city naming. Cards can be purchased by leveling up. One level is one card unlock point. A deck can have I think 21 cards to start, and with every ten level ups, can have an extra card in the deck. Cities level up by playing with them, and EXP is given for every building or troop made, or enemy building or troop destroyed. Cities can be customized by upgrading the buildings, such as France's Notre Dam by changing colours, adding features, etc. A minor touch but still interesting enough to have your own sort of style with leading a nation in the game. Your explorer can be named so you can make yourself, a friend, or family member be the greatest European explorer, Native American War Chief, Japanese Shogun, Indian Brahmin, or Chinese Master that has ever existed. The same goes for cities, you can name them the small rural town you live in, or your country's capital city and make it the most advanced city in the world! All theses extra features expand upon the replayability and fun that you can have with AOE3.   Note, AOE3 - The Asian Dynasties expansion was the latest released and updated. All Civs can be played on this expansion and the majority of the people play on this one. I suggest only playing the original AOE3 and War Chiefs when playing with campaign, or really dislike playing with or against the Asian Civs as they cannot be played in the others.  Also, check out Age of Mythology Extended Edition (AOM) on steam if you like this game, or if you're into Greek, Egyptian, Norse mythology. I prefer AOE3 myself, but AOM is my second favourite in the series. Personally, I would wait until this game, and/or AOM, go on sale to buy them but I still feel they are worth the cost. Like I said at the top, I have 3 disc copies of AOE3 that all work (long story) and also disc copy of AOM. These games ARE worth it.  All in all, I want to see AOE3 bounce back strong. If you're new looking for help, a partner to play with, or want to join a clan who are mostly active, just message me on steam and I hope to see you on the battlefield soon!   
8255	1	a	Great game, can`t believe they made clash of clans (castle siege) instead of a decent sequel.
8257	1	a	Age of Empires III: Complete Collection is a real-time strategy game from Ensemble Studios and published by to what now Microsoft Studios. It is a sequel to the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires III: Complete Collection also contains both expansion packs from Age of Empire III.  Age of Empires III saw many improvements and feature upgrades in term of gameplay while retaining the unique play of Age of Empires series. Many new features included are the new home city and card deck. Card deck allows you to call many abilities such as reinforcements of units, resources delivery, unique upgrades delivery and many more from home city to your new colony. Age of Empires III takes place in the new world of America. You will be seeing units such as the Musketeer, Dragoon, Minuteman and many cannons. Another new features added here is a trade post. Trade post can be built on trade routes or local tribes such as the Aztec to gain their allegiance and lets you train their unique units.  Graphics in Age of Empires III is definitely far better improved and upgraded than the previous Age of Empires, far better effects, models and textures, shaders, everything is beautiful and fully detailed in this game. Performance is also great, no issues that can ruin your play.  Seeing that many Microsoft games such as the Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology has been upgraded with Steamworks feature, Age of Empire III should see that support too, since this is the latest Age of Empire series.  Age of Empire III: Complete Collection is a great game to play, I recommend this.  Rating 9/10
8259	1	a	This game taught me more about history than any high-school course ever did.
8261	1	a	Beautiful game! If you are one of those guys that hate easy strategy games, and want something that relies more on your capacity of situation analysis, like war strategies, economic strategies, and psychological pressure, this game is perfect for you. You have different kinds of troops, like light infantry, heavy infantry, cavalry, artillery, and your settlers. And each one counters the other. So it's all about team work and planned strategies. You can either create a strong economy, or make a fast attack. Of course it's not as simple as that. That's why this game is so awesome! Each game is full of posibilities.
8263	1	a	The 'Test of Time' game. As good as it was in 2005.
8265	1	a	If you love complex and inovative RTS games this is for you; however, there are still many draw backs that new buyers should be aware of. There is no support from the dev's anymore due to complex company issues, so there will never be anymore balance changes or ui updates. Servers go down quite frequently. The little community that is there is stong but gets no attention. Over all the game is really fun but not worth spending $40 on.
8267	1	a	If you like shoving 50 cavalrymen into a space the size of a fridge then firebombing an entire colony to surrender in a matter of seconds, this game is for you.
8269	1	a	Great Game! needs to go on sale more, i have alot of friends who want to play but they dont have the money! lol bills, you know how it is ;)
8271	1	a	one of the best strategy games of all time.
8273	1	a	Best Game i ever had bought in my life, the series AOE was my childhood and now it came to this much! I love it! I just love the game! I just pray microsoft makes a Sequel in future!
8275	1	a	This game is still a masterpiece. Probably one of the best RTS games ever released.
8277	1	a	I wanted this game for years, finally I own it and it has been worth the wait, it's easily the best in the franchise (In my opinon.)  This time you play as the power hungry european empires from the colonial era, like The British Empire (Salutes to Union flag) The French, Spainish, Russians and more, addtionally since this the Complete collection, you get the bonus DLC which includes some tribes and Asain powers like Japan.  A lot of features have been added like trading posts, and you can upgrade them from transported by horse into trains, however they removed some features I enjoyed like Captapults and cannons attacking areas you want them to, for an example if theres a forest in the way, I could send a small army of cannons to destory the forest so I can build a wall or something, sadly this feature has been removed possibly due to a glitch where you can attack ally buildings with no penalties.  Overall if your a fan of RTS games, there is no reason to say no to this amazing game.  *Note* Everytime I hear 'The New World' I keep thinking of these.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtgGjZk5sTc    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_9HwLlkpE   The one above is easily my favorite.  
8279	1	a	A great game y0. Battles go on all over the map, whilst you hear the faint sounds of cannons from the safety of your town. Its the little things that make it good. 10/10
8281	1	a	I have owned the Collectors Edition of AoE III since it was released in November 2005. It is my most played game by far, probably above 3,000 hours. One thing I can say with complete certainty is, if you get into the online multiplayer, like really get into it. You will always come back to this game and enjoy every moment.   If you're a new player, and are willing to get into this game :    go ahead and message me, i'll try to help you out!  
8283	1	a	While singleplayer is pretty boring, AoE III is one of the most fun RTS games in multiplayer. Factions play differently, some feel like totally different game, but at the same time they are well balanced. This also forces use of different tactics against different kinds of enemies. There is an abundance of units and buildings, and the game is fast-paced. The graphics are amazing even today, AoE III is one of the best looking RTS games I've seen. The multiplayer is well alive even today, after so many years. I definitely recommend getting this game for every RTS fan. The only thing is that you shouldn't expect a game similar to AoE or AoE II as AoE III is a different game, however, even better in multiplayer in every way. 
8285	1	a	Beautiful graphic and great game system.  I really love AoE franchises.
8287	1	a	Awsome strategy game
8289	1	a	The fact that in a free battle (skirmish) you can reap the benefits of creating a decent town, trade route and fight your battles well is awesome. Great game for those who love to lead individual troops in games instead of units in mass
8291	1	a	 “I prefer face-to-face conversations. In case the situation turns bad, I know exactly who needs to be blown up.   Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a hybrid 2-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company Minmax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.    Atmosphere &amp; presentation:   + Large amount of ships with creative designs guarantee a lot of variety and enable a corresponding learning curve. + The salvage and mining mechanics keep up the motivation to explore new star systems.  + Size and mass of ships influence movement and inertia of each vehicle. + Late game introduces an ever shifting equilibrium of power.  o The faction system adds an interesting dimension to the game, but it has little impact on the behaviour or decision making of the player.   - Amount of side missions and randomly generated events throughout the galaxy are limited and repetitive.  - The musical background lacks variety.    Combat &amp; gameplay:   + Fluent combat mechanics create a dynamic battlefield with focus on tactical positioning.  + Each ship offers different customization options for weapon and auxiliary systems, which benefits the tactical spectrum of the game.  + Easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master skill tree challenges the player to gain more experience.  + Late game requires a more strategic approach of the evolving situation.   o Everything on the map can be attacked and destroyed.   Characters &amp; story:   + Story telling has a surprising and refreshing twist. + Well done integration and development of the zombie threat.  o Stereotypical portrayal of characters.   - Very little voice acting during the entire game.   Summary:   Minmax Games succeeded in creating a well-rounded game with only a few rough edges. SPAZ delivers much more action and tactics than one might expect of this indie title. The urge to unlock the next ship class, spending points on the elaborate skill tree or collecting credits for the next weapon upgrade will keep you up late into the night.

8293	1	a	SPAZ is an awesome game, you gather resources and manage your own fleet of starships, everything can be customized, from engines to missiles. Took me about 22 hours to finish the campaign, the map is huge, the more you explore the more ships and technologies you unlock, and to complete the package the game support mods, you can simply download a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica mod that will customize all your ships!
8295	1	a	I finished this game in 64 hours. That wasn't a wasted time, not at all. Because I like tactical strategies and I like RPGs. This game is mainly strategy with active pause. RPG elements is mostly for technical purposes like skills and leveling. So don't expect tons of talking.  But be prepared for tons of space explosions, destroyed and captured star bases, lasers, missiles, dozens of skills, upgrades, ships and all that stuff which should be in game like that. Yes, this game has it all. And all of that in open, procedurally generated world.  VERDICT: If you like space adventures, you will like this one. If you don't, better change your mind. If you really don't, why the hell did you start to read this at all?  Like this review?

8297	1	a	SPAZ is a gmae which I can heartily recommend based on a few short facts.  1. The game's graphics are beautiful with a unique and disticive art style and lots of interesting and diverse weather conditions. 2. The ship designs are distinctive with their own mix of strengths and weaknesses and each has fully customisable loadouts to better suit whatever your style of play. 3. The game is long. Very long in fact but still manages to make each system feel unique and mysterious. 4. I controls are natural and destinctive with hotkeys that allow all sorts of game changing things to occur including ejecting cargo, jettisoning spare crew and releasing the ship's armour all of which improve the handling of the ship. 5. It's cheap and worth every last dime you drop on it.  If you like exploration, space combat and custom ships then you can't go wrong with SPAZ.
8299	1	a	For a uncomplicated repetitive game its extremely addictive, maybe thats where simple beauty lies in this game. The atmosphere to the game is great, the graphics look really colorful, the combat is frantic and fun and the universe you explore is massive. Plus you get to unlock tons of cool stuff to have a laugh with.
8301	1	a	Delivers that old-school skill based freeflying space shooter gameplay (say that three times fast) just like the developers wanted and manages to combine it with fast paced naval style tactics in a 2 dimensonal battlefield to keep things interesting. On top of that they shift gears at the end game and throw in a light turn based strategy system on top of it.   Resource mangement can be a grind and a drag at times as your progress comes to an almost literal deadstop because your enemies are simply way too strong for you to even make a dent in their armor. Time has to be spent collecting resources to build ships while buttering up the factions for each system you visit for the tech upgrades they have unless you want to blow their stations to pieces so you can just take it instead, either way you're going to have to stop and smell the roses a few times, more than a few if you lose a lot of ships.  The plot is a throwback to the classic days as well, no 'deep' triple A slop here, just a decent story to keep the action going with a predictable unfolding if you pay any attention at all and a great ending to lead into the second game which I am now highly anticipating. Overall an excellent title for anyone who likes classic action, tactics and maybe a small sense of conquest and conquering at the same time.
8303	1	a	+RPG levelling +Wide-variety of ship types +Physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +Easy-to-learn resource management +Dark humored  -Grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -Sub-Par AI teammates -Low variety of equipment types -Low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching)  Listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up.  The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for Universe is easily the star, but Big Fight for Beef is also very good.  Even though SPAZ 2 is out, this is still definitely a buy.
8305	1	a	Nice story with awesome, simplified UI of complex mechanics and ship customization !  Can be stupidly hard on hardest difficulties if you're into that :P
8307	1	a	Surprisingly good  A 2D space game complete with 2D graphics. You have a special mothership that can bay a couple fighters, you move around galaxy as a merc team collecting resources, fighting, making pacts, upgrading your fighters, and finding off bounty hunters.   Part of the game is incredibly fun, some of it is incredibly tedious, but overall its great.
8309	1	a	Despite the odd title, this is a fun game if you like 2D space action, like collecting new ships and weapons, and don't mind having to grind a bit if you do poorly for awhile.   SPaZ is a top down space combat game where you mine resources and fight other ships. You gain power by gaining favor with two factions and buying weapon blueprints. You get ship blueprints from beating those ships. For me, getting those blueprints and seeing what each new ship or weapon could do was the most fun part of the game. There are many different types of equipment and you have limited upgrade points, so you'll have to pick a few trees to go down until late game when you can really pack on the level up. This gives the game some replayability if you like.  Combat is fun and you have a lot of options. You can put out a big, expensive ship and just mow down enemies, or you can put out a small fast ship that can't take much damage. While the small ships do die quickly, they are much less expensive, making it an important issue to consider. If you get low on resources, you can't build your big ships and have to either do easy missions or go mine. There are places to do so relatively safely, but that's the slight grind I mentioned.  I only had two issues with the game. The first relates to the factions. There are two and in each system they will have different feelings toward you. If you make them happy or mad in one system, it won't affect them in another. This is actually good. The problem is that one faction is always the one blocking the warp gates leading to other sectors. They must be cleared before you can move on. So you must either bribe the guards, which is extremely expensive, or attack them and ♥♥♥♥ them off.   The second problem is that the end game got very boring and 'samey' as I cleared system after system. However, that was me being completionist. You can finish the game without doing so but more systems cleared will give more aid in the last battle.   Overall, I had a lot of fun. I'm not ready to jump into a second playthrough yet, but I'm happy with the time spent with this game and I will be keeping an eye on the second.
8311	1	a	Extreamly complex space fleet management. SPAZ is basically FTL meets Mount and Blade. The action feels like an addicting top-down space-shooter. This game is not for casual gamers. It can be a bit overwhelming but if you stick with it SPAZ can be quite a rewarding experaince.
8313	1	a	While I'm a bit late into the game of reviewing SPAZ, writing it anyway couldn't hurt. Space Pirates and Zombies is a action-strategy space shooter with elements of random generation. While you have some control over how random it is, it only serves to increase or decrease the difficulty in the long run.  Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid. You pilot your ship around with WASD keys, and shooting your weaponry with the mouse. What makes it special if that you don't point and shoot, but the direction of your ship controls where your shots are. If you place a weapon on the front of your ship, expect it to shoot forward until the higher class ships which have rotating turret mounts that do just that. Even then, anything other than lasers will still need to lead the target, as nothing is hitscan. This makes shooting more skill based.  At the same time, you have to pilot your ship to avoid incoming shots from enemy ships. This ends up leading to dog fight type scenarios where you and your opponent are dodging around each other trying to get a shot in. This is where a lot of the enjoyment of the game is, since a lot of battles will be decided on whether or not you can out-maneuver the AI, especially on higher difficulties when the enemies become too strong to kill in a head-on fight.  As you kill enemies, you can pick up orbs of Data to level up and gain research points. The tech tree is nothing complex, since it is mostly just a direct % increase in damage and other stats for each weapon or ship subsystem. This is however needed, since more powerful versions of equipment are unusable until you level up that system. But before you can even equip something, you must acquire the blueprints of each item. Naturally, higher level equipment requires more blueprints, which can be obtained by the faction bases. Either buy from them, or blow it up and loot the charred remains of the base, if you can.  The Bounty Hunter system adds in some extra challenge to the mix, if you choose to allow them to spawn. Killing enemies within their territory increases the bounty on your head. Eventually, if left unchecked, the hunters will come after you in an attempt to collect that bounty. The higher your bounty, the higher the chance. You also have the chance to be extorted on the way out of one of their systems. Failure to pay and you'll need to fight them off. You'd think this would increase your bounty further, but instead gives you respect, which lowers the bounty. If the bounty falls into the negative, you start to gain respect points. This acts as a buffer before you will start accumulating a bounty, and ensures you won't be attacked until you drain all of your respect.   Another way to gain respect, as well as money and Data, is to fight in arena matches set up by the hunters. As you progress, harder challenges are unlocked, each with 3 difficulties. If you want to avoid ambushes every are or two, you may want to take advantages of these arena matches. They can even be repeated for a lesser reward if you are out of fresh fights. And if you really have no other option, you can pay your bounty off yourself. As a whole, this system adds more challenge to the game, which is welcome when not playing on the highest difficulty.  There's much more to gameplay, but I don't wish to drag on. So I'll end with one major flaw I found, and that mostly comes with the late game. If you fail to kill one of the smallest ships but weakened it to critical health, it will flee. For several thousand feet. If you don't switch to a small ship of your own that is just as fast, it will get away, and you'll spend minutes at a time waiting for it to come back. This becomes a huge pace breaker, and sometimes even causes you to be put in more difficult situations in the late game, when enemies can spawn just by you staying in an area for long. Maybe if they would retreat from battle, leaving the area entirely, this wouldn't be an issue.  Story: The setting is that of a far future, and space travel has advanced to that of colonizing other star systems. This is mostly thanks to the currency of the game, Rez. This subtance is mined from deposits floating in space to craft vessels. In order to become rich, many set off to mining colonies to gather as much Rez as they can. Legend also has it, there is a grand deposit in the center of the universe. This deposit is what our protagonists are looking for. The only problem is getting there. Warp gates between star systems are guarded by the UTA, the police space force, essentially. Not only this, but the grand warp gates to the planets near the center are locked down tight. A nice twist comes in the zombie part of the title, which you discover upon finally reaching these center systems. I'd elaborate, but I don't wish to spoil it.  Graphics: I care very little for graphics as long as they are serviceable. Meanwhile, SPAZ has great graphics. Each ship looks nice, if simple at times, and the lighting is bright and colorful.  Sound: The music of the game mostly boils down to ambient noise, but there are a few tracks here or there that are enjoyable. Cutscenes are also narrated by TotalBiscuit, who does a fine enough job. Though even he says he did terribly, and it is clear enough that he could have done better if he tried. The sound effects are all well and good, meanwhile. Each weapon has its own shot sound effects, and the sounds of another ship being hit are clear to hear. But after awhile, hearing the pew pew pews of the game gets old.  Overall, the game is a terrific time. It serves as a challenge when it needs to, and is just pure fun to shoot stuff in space. I'd recommend this to anyone who thinks they might enjoy this when shown any gameplay.
8315	1	a	You are a group of mercenaries, traveling through randomly generated galaxy, gathering resources - actually there is only one main resource - 'rez'. You're trying to reach the galaxy core to discover the origin of 'rez'. That's how the story looks like, pretty simplistic, but by no means boring. SPAZ is almost completely non-linear - You can visit a lot of galaxy sectors without touching the main storyline.   Gameplay reminds me of another great game 'Escape Velocity Nova'. You build ships, gather resources, research new technologies, fight against 4 game factions - Civilians, UTA, Zombies and sometimes Bounty Hunters. Built-in tutorial is all You need to learn basics of SPAZ.  SPAZ features top-down 2D graphics, and I find it a big advantage - everything is nice and simple. Sounds are also good, music nicely blends into the gameplay.  To sum this up - If you're a fan of space games, at least try SPAZ - it's a true gem among the genre.  PROS: Nice 2D graphics Non-linear gameplay, high replayability Easy to learn, difficult to master RPG elements Lots of ships to discover  CONS: Combat can be frustrating at higher difficulties Becomes repetitive at times
8317	1	a	SPAZ is one hell of an action &amp; strategy game, with you taking command a small ship to eventually a large capital ship you'll be roaming the galaxy, attacking or working with 2 factions and even bounty hunters. Amazing game, if you're a fan of any strategy or top-down action shooters this is a must have!
8319	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is a good old fasioned 2D space battle and exploration game with strrong ARPG elemements. While the story is somewhat shallow, the game universe is procedurally-generated and randomised, there's plenty of area to explore and conquer, although at times, it gets to be a bit of a grind, although if you're careful, you can reduce the amount of grinding necessary by trading with civilian stations. The tutorial is actually quite good and the game will stop and show you new mechanics as they come into play. Totally worth buying, I've sunk over 235 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.
8321	1	a	Overall a great game.  Personally, I like to play games while I drink (hey, it keeps the replayability factor up when I forget :-P), watch Netflix and BS with buddies. This game is great for that in the sense that I can step away from it while it's running and not come back to a dead toon or missed out on something extremely important. Also (bonus points) if I get a little too far gone, chances are good that I again didn't miss something that I can't look back on the log to figure out what happend. I think this game may have been made specifically for me.  I love leveling up. I love keeping an eye on resources. I love the discovery aspect. I love upgrading and discovering new weapon/ship models. Oh and there's a fun storyline with multiple characters. The best part is that each one of them are friggin ♥♥♥♥♥♥! I hate dainty little do-gooders when it's a universe they just wouldn't survive in. Every character I've come across in this game thus far has been such a friggin @sshole and I love it!  I can't wait until SPAZ 2 comes out if it's anything like the original!  Play it, or don't. No one likes you anyway.
8323	1	a	Fun game, reminds me of the Escape Velocity games back in the 90's. Great Mod support and community on the games official webpage. Cannot wait until the sequel.
8325	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, I put a lot of hours into it, and was rewarded with an interesting story, lots to explore and heaps of combat.  What I like about it is that there's unlimited fights to have and things to explore, you can just wonder around the galaxy and fight endlessly. You can see the challenge rating of each star system, so you know what you’re in for before you go there, and if you want some relaxing fun you can just pop back to an easy system and kill everything with impunity. There are lots of spaceships to discover, and lots of weapons, that will suit your playing style and dexterity.  Combat is the central part of the game, you have a number of ships to field, and the AI is decent. Combat takes place on a 2D playing field, and you have a God’s eye view of the whole map, so finding things to shoot is easy. Sometimes it gets tedious racing around the combat map to reach waypoints, or protect space ships with no self-preservation instinct.  However, by the time I was ¾ of the way through the game it was getting tedious. I was only driven to complete the story, I could barely tolerate entering more combat because it was becoming repetitive. I did finish the game, and I did enjoy completing the story, but I can’t see myself playing a second time.  Overall, I recommended this game as a good distraction. Exploding enemy ships and capturing or shooting their crew after they eject is satisfying for a gamer like me.
8327	1	a	Awesome game! Cheesy portraits and 'acting' but amazing and simple dynamics.  It is hard to find games like this. Spaceship RPG with customizable ship arsenal. Sandbox like maps and quirky storyline.  It would be great to see additional weapons and support addons for the ships as well as extended storyline and new ship models.
8329	1	a	I haven't spent much of my time playing this game, but what I have experienced I have enjoyed. With many ship types, equipment combinations, and faction choices, this game will offer you many space age hours of enjoyable gameplay. I look forward to getting further into it when I have more time to dedicate. If you can get it on sale, don't miss out on the opportunity.
8331	1	a	I really enjoyed this game - fun, quirky and progresses at a good rate. Some good RPG elements that can sometimes be overshadowed by spam building spaceships and just throwing them at the enemy, hoping it will be enough.
8333	1	a	At first I couldn't stand this game because the controls/ui were a little cryptic and 'home made'. But once you get past that stuff there are some really good mechanics at the core. The way the game occurs on different 'scales' helps this space game not feel so empty (as many space games so often do).  At a large-scale, you are making choices about which system to go to and juggling faction reputation to gain all-important research.  At a mid-scale you are trying to build a diverse set of ships that can deal shield and hull damange.  And at a small-scale you are working with positioning and ship crews to gain an edge in fights.  All-around, an interesting take on the ARPG, and something you should at least consider buying.
8335	1	a	  Review: Space Pirates And Zombies
8337	1	a	Missing Star Control and Space Rangers type of games? Grab SPAZ.
8339	1	a	This is a very good game for its price, it is a old fashion top down action game with a basic fleet controle function.  I heighly recomend this game to every one, definatly if its on sale. If your unsure about it try the demo out and see what you think.  10/10
8341	1	a	Customization and privateering. Looking forward to SPAZ 2
8343	1	a	This game is brilliant. There's no other way to describe it. The sense of combat this game gives you is absolutely among the best I've ever experienced. If you're ripping the enemy a new one, you can tell. If you're getting ripped a new one, you can definitely tell.  This game can be punishing too, forcing you to grind your way through certain areas, which is a bit of a downside. However, you shouldn't really face that issue unless you're playing on INSANE! and are fighting 10 tech levels above you.  There's a lot more I could talk about but all in all, this game a great buy for a cheap price. As of now I've already sunk 16 hours into this game and I plan on sinking many, many more into it. 9.5/10!
8345	1	a	Great game  Worth every hour of playing. If you are into simple not complicated 2D space shooters it's game for you. There's a lot of humor mainly in text (unfortunately) but it won't make this game worse.   fully customizable ships. You can equip your ship as you like it: (engines, armor, energy shield, any weapon slot, add-ons, crew)   every ship in this game is different and almost all obtainable so you won't fly with the same thing until you find the best one   easy controls, use WSAD and mouse (Yes you control ship by yourself) ;]   not enough resources, or crew? No problem destroy UTA, Civilian station. You also don't have to buy technology from any station, you are the pirate ARRRRRRR :D   fight like gladiator with your ship in Bounty Hunters arena  I like the zombie infection idea it reminds me Beast from Homeworld: Cataclysm.  Overall 9/10 
8347	1	a	+fine space shooter with some fleet management +nice sound and visuals  -ui isnt scaling with resolution, forcing you to play in some low res matching your screen ratio -quite grindy and repetitive after a while
8349	1	a	Yes it has zombies, and yes it has pirates, what more does it need to be said? Well I haven't really finished the game, but I have put more than enough hours into this masterpiece, first you should know, this game has been made by 2 guys, which is very impressive. The game is basically an old school space game in a modern fashion, which adds nicely up. I can really recommend it, if you think it's too expensive, no worries, this game is quite often on sale. And if you fell in love with this game whilst reading my review, no worries! They're working on a sequel, which'll supposedly have co-op.
8351	1	a	+fine space shooter with some fleet management +nice sound and visuals  -ui isnt scaling with resolution, forcing you to play in some low res matching your screen ratio -quite grindy and repetitive after a while
8353	1	a	Very fun. You should play it.
8355	1	a	If you have fond memories of playing Subspace back in the day, but always wished the game had a single-player mode, SPAZ is the game for you.  A top-down shooter, your ships handle like the one from Asteroids, with thrust and momentum affecting your crafts as they goes flying across the battlefield. You have an entire squadron at your disposal, but can only directly control a single ship at a time. The others are handled by the AI, but you can and you swap between ships with the press of the button. Each ship can be upgraded or swapped out for different ones better suited to the challenges at hand.  Instead of flags and bases, the game pits your squadron against varieties of enemy ships. Your squadron jumps from system to system in the galaxy, mining for resources to upgrade your ships while completing different missions. There isn't too much variety in the gameplay, with most of the missions boiling down to 'blow up everything that isn't yours.' There is a story, too, but it is pretty thin.  I got a kick out of the game, mostly for the nostalgia of playing something similar to Subspace. The lack of variety and paper-thin story hurt the game, and give little reason to grind your way to finish. But for the price, it's fun while it lasts, and I'm hoping for a sequel or add-on that fleshes out the core gameplay further.
8357	1	a	Brings back fond memories of Star Control. Loved every bit of it!
8359	1	a	SPAZ is a fantastic example of a game that nither takes itself seriously nor cares what you think. Its a fantastic and fun SCI Fi Cyber punk game with a grat sountrack and tons of humor. If you want something to play all the way through or just to flip on when you are bored, then SPAZ is definitely a great choice.
8361	1	a	its quite good and even comes with the 'and bounty hunters' (i want to say expansion)
8363	1	a	There are those indie games that truly captivate your attention and keep you engaged for hours on end, and you know it's a gem when you find yourself spending the whole evening mining, collecting, running and blasting your way through zombie space.  MiniMax Game's Space Pirates and Zombies was developed by two blokes in Canada and boy, for two guys this game sure does outstand in the indie pool. You start out as a little 4-hardpoint ship, just plunderin' the good plunder. As you progress through the story you'll find out something crazy has stirred up at the centre of the universe. Something that allows flesh eating monstrosities to biologically enhance and drive their own ships, despite being mindless husks. The story has an enormous gravity to it; as the plot progresses, your fleet of AI-controlled ships, blueprints, hull types, weapon types, subsystem effectiveness, mining ability and the like go on the up as well. Doing this makes the player feel the gravity of the situation: there's a huge threat of space zombies capable of surviving without oxyen floating about at the center of the universe and you're going to need all the help you can get.  I suppose the reason why I find this game so enjoyable is an amalgamation of perfect game dynamics; the tactical RTS-like command of your own ship, with a main player-controlled ship and up to 4 other AI controlled ships, all of which are available for the player to directly take control of any time during flight. Missions are undertaken for either the civillians of a star system or the UTA - the universe's private military force, and doing favours for one faction often angers the other. The ever expansive tech tree is a delight, as well - research data, the space equivalent of experience points become increasingly important to get that rank of weaponary, subsystem, engines, or armour that you know you're going to need at the current system. As time seems to go forward when you jump from planet to planet and star to star, the players get used to planning a route according to a star systems ecosysem, 'difficulty' (measured in civillian or UTA strength) and managability.   With the addition of vicious money-hungry bounty hunters to the mix, I've never enjoyed any space-sim-top-down-physics-based-shooter as I have with this. I've found myself dedicating chunks of my gaming sessions to mining, exploring, trading, or fighting in this game. And when you finally get all the blueprints, all the ship hulls, and high-tier tech skill upgrades, you're still finding yourself having a blast dealing with pesky space zombies. In a nutshell, I haven't quite experianced any game like this but I can sum it up into two expressions: YARR and BRAINS.
8365	1	a	A MUST BUY. EXTREMELY GOOD GAME.  An awesome 2D top-down space shooting and exploring game, well balanced, with a strong if a bit predictable and cliched main plot. Delivers an extremely satisfying experience in combat, has a light design-your-own-spaceship element - you choose a weapon layout for pre-determined hulls with some ability to modify the bahaviour and handling of your ships - which is excellently done and delivers a ton of fun.  All the elements of the game are extremely well done, polished and provide a ton of fun and relaxing space shooting experience. Highly recommended. Probably the best 2d top-down exploration-style shooter ever created.
8367	1	a	Amazing game. Nice graphics, tight controls, even the story is pretty good. But the best part, it's a carrier-full of fun!  It's not all perfect, balance seems a bit wacky. Some weapon systems do not seem to be as good as others (cannons are amazing, drones not so much for example). But it's still a lot of fun. Definitely recommended if you like like space games, but get motion sickness with 3D games (I do). So this is perfect for me.  The devs did a really good job with this. Amazing what 2 people can accomplish.
8369	1	a	SPAZ is not the sort of game I'm really good at. Nevertheless, I found myself dumping heaps of time into the game. I recently started a game and found quite a bit of new content had been added. Definitely a cool surprise and even better that I didn't have to buy some DLC to get it. The community for this game seems to be pretty active and a variety of mods can be found.
8371	1	a	SPAZ is a fun space strategy game with nice graphics and satisfying gameplay. I recommend to anyone who likes the genre. 7/10
8373	1	a	Highly recommended.  This is easily one of the best games I have played in years.  Althought it does not have the fancy 3D near human modern graphics that most 'players' want in today's games, I find it far more preferable to those.  The game plays exactly as advertised, like the old Star Control games. You are a small band trying to find the magic pot of gold at the center of the universe and travel along the universe, up to 300 systems, fighting and exploring and building up your fleet.  The beauty of this game is there is no right or wrong way to play it.   You jump into a system and if you feel like fighting you can or you can dock at a station and bribe the guards. You can fight one side in a map then jump into the next one and be that sides friends. Or you can fight both sides if you feel like it. There is enough variety in the ship classes and equipment to keep it interesting for many games yet to come. Also, the maps are randomly generated each time so no 2 games will ever play the same. What makes this game truly awesome is it was made by 2 people who loved the product and were not out to make a quick buck at the players expense. I can not wait for SPAZ2 to come out later.  I hope I will be the first one to buy that one.!!!!
8375	1	a	This is one of the most simplistic RPGs I have ever played. And I love it. It's so addicting. I really wish the community had a bigger following, it's really rare to find such a simple game with such high entertainment value and replayability,
8377	1	a	BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING COMBAT AND PIRACY IN THE SPACE FUTURE. RESOURCES ARE CURRENCY, AND HUMAN LIVES ARE ALSO CURRENCY. IT IS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE ARE BUT MERE CELLS AND ORGANS IN THE BODIES OF MY FLEET OF GREAT SPACE WARSHIPS. ALSO THERE ARE ZOMBIES AT SOME POINT BUT I HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED THEM REALLY, PERHAPS I NEED TO GET FARTHER INTO THE GAME. I DO NOT KNOW HOW THREATENING ZOMBIES WILL BE IN SPACE, UNLESS THEY TOO HAVE SPACE WARSHIPS
8379	1	a	Why are space pirates called space pirates? Because they arrr in space
8381	1	a	Very enjoyable game with decent replay value.
8383	1	a	I have to admit, this game is extremly addicting to me, i am not 100% sure why.  Its a bit like the Torchlight of space games, you collect and fight and go just on for the next level - again and again.  It gets a bit repetitive after you have explored a good part of the galaxy and you have seen most of the missions, but still its fun for me, after more than 20 hours. Well worth the price from a play time / price perspective. And I havent even seen any zombies yet... so theres more of the story still for me =)  There is a Storyline to follow and side missions, some funny ones too. You have alot of technologies and shiptypes to discover, different tactics you can try out, and the graphics are pretty and colourfull.  I also played the beta before it was on steam, it allready has improved alot since that version and the Developers want to deliver even more content.  You can register this game on steam wherever you have bought it, thats also great.  If you dont have it allready - get it!
8385	1	a	Old school gaming mechanics and genres updated and taken to new heights.   I'd have written this off as a cheap clone of numerous games if I were judging it based on a few screenshots. The truth is it's deep, addictive, massive and is comprehensively supported by both dev and community.  A polished title in every respect.
8387	1	a	This is a great game and honestly there should be more like it out there. Imagine my surprise at finding this game late (and on a great sale) and then hearing SPAZ 2 will be out soon! The gameplay is smooth and the battles are fast and fierce with beautiful graphics around you as you blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Some of the missions are recycled often but when you're looking for new swag for your ships you just keep going. This isn't a game where you can rule the galaxy easily and destroy the AI you have to actually think as you play. I really appreciate the devs and the time they obviously put into this game. It's a blast!
8389	1	a	Very interesting game!!
8391	1	a	This game is cool as ♥♥♥♥. It gets pretty hard once the zombies are introduced, but you'll enjoy the entire game. Well, if it looks like your kind of thing, anyway. While writing this review I'm actually having trouble coming up with anything negative to say about this game. It's great, so just get it.
8393	1	a	One of the best games I've played in the last 3-5 years and for certain a game that sits somewhere in the best twenty games I've played. And honestly, a game that shares one of twenty seats with timeless classics and extremely fine games such as Star Control, Master of Orion, X-COM, Terra Nova and Battlezone (1998) definitely deserves all these/those praises! Plenty of depth to it as well. 10/10
8395	1	a	Great game! Proberly the best 2D arcade space shooter ever!   When you unlocked the big capital ships you feel like Capt. Kirk himself in a fight. But not only the action, also the RPG elements (trade, tech-tree, unlocks) are real fun. Try the free demo. But if you like oldschool action, this is a must buy!!!
8397	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is addicting, funny, and exciting. The game was made by a small team of independant developers which did a wonderful job with SPAZ and this game definately has a lot of content for your money. When I was first playing the game, I often found myself saying, 'WHAT IS THAT?!' because some new giant ship had decided to turn its weapons against me. Thinking back, this game produces a nostalga now and again which brings me to play it even after beating it multiple times.   I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, sci fi, rockets, lasers, and strategy. I only have one problem with this game, that being its lack of multiplayer capabilities, but if you get passed that it is definately worth a buy.
8399	1	a	Shockingly fun little game, will absolutely provide bang for your buck.
8401	1	a	A great game which combines 2D with modern graphic capabilities. A vast gameplay that allows players to customize their play style, explore the unknown, enhance your spaceship arsenal, get involved in the factions evolved and enjoy the humorous storyline of the game. Spaceship models are well designed, weapons and modules too. And all the above have been developed by two people who happen to love such games and put a great effort into this game.
8403	1	a	A very fun game, from the start, it leaves you wanting to upgrade your fleet, as you progress, you learn about all the upgrades and different parts that leave you wanting more. It is not just about fighting, it includes financial management and many many other areas and all will add up to the excitement and fun you will have.
8405	1	a	Recommending this.  Game was developed by 2 people (and it was developed to the end, without any BS kickstarters that end in ♥♥♥♥). Game has progression system (leveling and building of a fleet - the fleet is not big, but you can customise individual ships to your liking). Story is not too bad, need to read the crew chatter inbetween chapters to get the feel for it...story is narrated by TotalBiscuit btw.  for 2 Eur ? It is a steal, complete steal. Also, mods. Also, sequel is coming...
8407	1	a	Now this, ladies and gentlemen, is a piece of work. It's got an interesting storyline that surprises you with not exactly plot twists- but... surprises. I was using some awfully small ships when I encountered a group of extremely large enemies coincidentally sitting right where an object I need to grab is. I was told to take them out. With difficulty I finished the job. Now, that may seems insane, but when you learn how the CPU ships are going to try to attack you, you'll set your ships to different modes to make use of their evasive moves and such. This game is great, there is a ton to do, from persuading people you're on their side to blowing up bases. Before you know it, you'll have played so much (if you like it as much as me and my friends do) you'll go from taking out a weak Dart ship to blowing up Lvl 3 Bounty Hunter Bases. There's always somewhere to go to upgrade your gear or to open warp gates and such. Fun game. 9/10
8409	1	a	It is fun to try and find the best weapon &amp; upgrade combos. Looking forward to the sequel!
8411	1	a	Pretty good cheap game. Reminds me of FTL, but it has a longer life. If its in a sale, its a good buy :)
8413	1	a	SPaZ is kind of a throwback. Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type. This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas. You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up. There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same. There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on). Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined. So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.  There are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious. The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B. Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..  The big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them. If you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley. If not, there isn't a whole lot here that'll change your mind.
8415	1	a	'I wonder if their eyes really do POP in space?!'
8417	1	a	Fantastic space RPG/arcade shooter with meny hours of gameplay. Reminds me of Elite 2 I played on my Amega 1200.  
8419	1	a	Such a fun and challenging game. Definitely worth the purchase.
8421	1	a	Totally worth getting. A space-RPG with some team elements
8423	1	a	This game has taken many hours from me unlike any other game thus far. Think of this game as a... top down... twin stick shooter... version of EVE Online. It's almost the exact same thing at it's base, you fly around, shooting stuff, mining stuff and building your fleet. Mind you it's single player only it's a great game. With voice acting by TotalBiscuit it's an amazing price. You owe it to your self to buy this game and play the living snot out of it! Buy it... now!

8427	1	a	Really really really cool and entertaining game!!!! Basically kind of a big deal.
8429	1	a	This is a really awesome game.
8431	1	a	Very very fun game with tons of ships to chose from for many play styles .  (my favorite being a medium sized ship with speed and a cloak with a turret mount turret preferably the battle station)
8433	1	a	Space, Pirates, And Zombies. Well you pretty much get what the title says*. This game was pretty fun, the exploration, the mining, the combat, the zombies*, and everything else made this game into something that can be truely enjoyed. I would reccomend this to anyone. It is really facinating, exploring all of the stars, planets, etc. And it is something you should buy.              *Pirates not included**.  **Unless you are a pirate. 
8435	1	a	This 2D space shooter gives you quick, fun gameplay and ship modification that allows for unique approaches to beating the game's many challenges. Overall it isn't all too complicated, and would make a great game for those who aren't looking for something complicated for the sake of being complicated.
8437	1	a	Never thought Ill have 47 hours on record on an Indie game, but everything was just marvelous about this game, from Dabbing to Graphics, I cant wait for the release of S.P.A.Z. 2. Awsome game.
8439	1	a	Very very fun and so much to do. I also really like the simple but nice looking graphics.
8441	1	a	great game to play helps me to lose myself in the game at least lol cant wait till the second one comes out
8443	1	a	Very fun game, you collect rez, fight off civs or the space police, and try to get through each solar system before you are burned to a crisp. Control many ships, or have your other ships follow you while you control only one. Easy to pick up, hard to master.
8445	1	a	I played this all the way through (offline) back in the day. It's strange because the shallow gameplay would normally cause me to give it a thumbs down, but there is something about this game that got me totally hooked and I've recently played it halfway through again. Now that I've come here to write a review I've discovered that SPAZ2 has just gone to early access and the video for it it making my heart thump already. Anyway, back to my review...  Cons (none of which matter to me)  The game universe is enormous but to be honest all a bit samey. You have to complete endless tasks to gain the technology and resources to upgrade your ships, but these tasks mostly involve battling enemies which is really the be-all and end-all of this game. In theory you're supposed to tailor your ships/weapons to the task at hand, but in practice it doesn't really seem to matter, you just equip the best weapons you can find and use them for everything. It's not the most intellectually challenging game.  Con (which does matter)  There is a storyline to this game, with an ending. After it had finished, to my dismay, I discovered that it was impossible to go back and play some more with the massive battleships I had worked for hours on end to build up. Bear this in mind before you tackle the final task, or make a data backup!  Pros  It's all about building bigger and better ships with more and more firepower and watching the battle mayhem. Especially towards the end of the game when huge battleships are blasting each other to smithereens it's a sight to behold, and the amazing thing is that all this glorious graphics action doesn't seem to lag or stutter at all, it's smooth as silk.  Now enough of this, I'm off to buy SPAZ2!
8447	1	a	WOW!!!! This game is absolutley amazing! I've been hooked every since I've installed it. Great blend of R.P.G and top down shooter mixed with elements of strategy. Easy controls, great voice clips (I laughed out loud), awesome story, colurful level design and an overall visual aesthetic that is a work of art. Tons of missions and side missions in a huuuuuge galaxy that you explore at your own leisure. For a two man indie company to produce such a fine game, it renews my faith that the little guys can compete with the big development giants, but just on a different level. I was almost choked up when in the opening screen the developers leave a very personal message thanking you for buying it.  I will be playing this game for a very long time.  Bravo MinMax!  and to everyone else  BUY THIS GAME!!!!
8449	1	a	Fun, but gets to be a bit of a grind at parts, especially if bounty hunters are enabled.  Overall, a challanging, fun game that runs really well even on lower-spec computers like mine.
8451	1	a	Fun concept and style but it gets sort of repetitive after awhile. Spacecraft dogfights are awesome!
8453	1	a	If you're like me and you loved playing top-down space shooters back in the 90's this game will take you right back to your roots. The artwork is nice to look at (other then the character portraits, which are comically bad to look at), and the writing isn't terrible. As far as combat goes it plays great! Being able to have multiple ships flying with you that have decent AI is a wonderful thing.
8455	1	a	An excellent game that is incredibly addicting. Well worth the price tag, and a must have. A simple game to play that is just loads of fun and easily spend the hours away playing. 9/10
8457	1	a	Cheap and ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, made by just 2 guys but loads of fun
8459	1	a	There was, once upon a time, back in the earliest days of MMORPG's a game that went by the name of Diaspora. It was a simple yet highly addictive space battle and trading game, made by a very small team of coders. Guilds were formed, alliances made, ♥♥♥♥ was flung, and all in a small java based applet of 2D glory.  Now we have S.P.A.Z; a single player game of space battles and trading with RPG elements. Very addictive, very funny, very shiny, and above all else, very Indie; made by a team of 2 people. So Diaspora for the modern day but without the multiplayer aspect and yet just as fantastic.  9/10
8461	1	a	✓ Really cool space adventure game, with freedom of choice and lots of neat features. ✓ Pretty graphics ✓ Well animated ✓ Good game mechanics ✓ Linux support!
8463	1	a	Great name good space combat narrator totalhalibut youtube beats lots of ships cheap value for money
8465	1	a	Great game!. And It's an Indie title so you know the two (yes two) people who worked on it really gave a full effort. And it shows. I totally reccamend purchasing this game.
8467	1	a	I had my fun with this game. Not sure what else to say then its as cheap as a Burger right now, but the burger is eaten in a minute or 2...but this game is gonna entertain for weeks. Also great replayability...doesnt tax computers much, all around good
8469	1	a	I normally do not write reviews but i had to do it for this game.  SPAZ (Space Pirates And Zombies) is really a beautiful love letter to the old days of top down space shooters.  Pros: Stellar Presentation (hehe)    good 2d graphics    nice music    upgrades    ship fitting    challenges (bounty hunter)    different enemy types    even asteroid mining is fun    mutliple ships in your fleet    fun and diverse combat (lasers/cannons, fighter drones, cloaking, mines, rockets, bombs, boarding, ...)   Cons:    Can sometimes become a little bit grindy, but there are almost always ways around the grind.   Btw. I absolutely love TotalBiscuit (John Bain) as the narrator.  Buy it, play it, you won't regret it.
8471	1	a	Oh good Lord, make me a son and I'll name it SPAZ 2!
8473	1	a	Spaceships, zombies, lasers and pirates - what could go wrong? Best gaem evah!
8475	1	a	when I had this game I really loved it during the time that it was free, but when the free time ran out I was very dissapointed to find the I had to end up paying for it. Maybe another like one free day sale but hvae me not ever having to pay for it.  Besids all that, Its a really great game :D
8477	1	a	I'd forgotten how good this is. It changed since the first time I played, I think...  Nothing earth-shattering, but if you enjoy the game after the first few solar systems, you'll probably enjoy the rest. And there's a PLOTS too. And you can skip the 'voice acting.' :P
8479	1	a	I love the elements of this which call to mind old-school shareware sci-fi classics. The exploration, resource-gathering, ship design, and combat are all very rewarding, and I like the cast of renegade characters. Highly recommended, despite a somewhat slow set of starting missions.
8481	1	a	get it it spells out SPAZ.  coming soon to a cinema game shop near you  rebels empires titans ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s derbyshire  get it it spells out SATAN
8483	1	a	Really??? Zombies and Space, How could you want anything else?
8485	1	a	Overhead, 360 degree asteroids-type shooter with RPG mechanics and trade. Loved it for a while but the grind to improve my fleet became too slow to enjoy anymore, and I could no longer survive in any uncharted systems. It's worth $5 at least. I had a lot of hours of fun.
8487	1	a	I had to come back to this game and restart it, because I don't think I really understood what was going on the first time I tried it. But if you really understand the systems and how you should progress, this is an excellent game. Fun spaceship dogfights with a vast world to explore, diplomacy to manage, and lots of different ways to progress. Really impressed.
8489	1	a	It involves Space, Pirates, AND Zombies! What more reasons could you possibly need? One of my favourite games.
8491	1	a	Fantastic game from it's ship customization to the animations. Extrmely amazed this was made by 2 people! This is a must buy for anyone!
8493	1	a	Cheap and ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, made by just 2 guys but loads of fun
8495	1	a	This is a really enjoyable game. I good blend of Space and Pirates. I've yet to really encounter zombies though, so I can't say if they are in good measure or not.
8497	1	a	A surprisingly deep game. Combat and customization remind me of Mechwarrior; economics and missions are similar to that of Freelancer; the story itself is reminscent of Homeworld and other space sims. Well worth the price, even if it was in a bundle.
8499	1	a	SPAZ is a great game were you can destroy spaceships and stations of mass destruction and build a fleet and you can add mods which is a cool feature but i wish it had multiplayer
8501	1	a	This one was a lot of fun. Building up resources, leveling tech, exploring space, and pretty fun battles. I'm hoping that there is a part two at some point.
8503	1	a	Well, I have always been a fan of space strategy and RPG games. This one seems to have elements of both. If you liked the first two Master of Onion games, you will probably like this as well.
8505	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is a point and click adventure game in the vein of Lucasarts classics such as Monkey Island, as well as Sierra classics such as Leisure Suit Larry and Police Quest. It tells the unlikely and comedic romatic tale of Space Pirates Falling in love with Zombies, and their misadventures as they try to make it work. With the Bounty Hunters addition, it turns into a love triangle and will tear at the strings of your heart. Youll laugh, youll cry, the writing is exceptional throughout the twists and turns of the story. Overall this game is a fantasic release from a studio run by just two gentlemen for a knack for releasing heartwarming adventure games. I look forward to their future releases. 8/10.
8507	1	a	This game reminds me a bit of Freelancer and Dark Star One, mixed with Armada from the Dreamcast. I enjoy this genre! If you enjoyed stage 1 of spore you'll love this.
8509	1	a	If you loved the space shooter games of yore then this is a dream come true! Customize your own fleet, purchase new tech, ally or betray two factions and prepare for a massive galatic zombie infestion!
8511	1	a	All kinds of Yes!
8513	1	a	SPAZ is yet another game that the screenshots and trailers do no justice. The game was made by only two people.  The universe you are set in is randomly generated and has a small amount of customization in size. The smaller the universe, the harder the difficulty between each galaxy. The bigger the universe, the longer the overall game and the more stretched out resources are. The game tells you not to do your first playthrough on the hardest difficulty. I immediately went and ignored this because I love a good challenge.  And boy does SPAZ deliver. You have up to three of your own ships in play at once. You can manually control one of the three ships at any time and the AI will take over the other two. The combat can go beyond mindlessly killing at times in the harder difficulties and thought is needed to plan out what you are going to do. Getting a game over is rare but progression is also challenging.  Good for casual and hardcore players. I'd write more but I've run out of room.
8515	1	a	After playing this game for 56 total hours and being at level 107 with 31/48 achievements done I finally managed to finish THE 2ND MISSION OF THE MAIN STORY LINE. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, level 100 ♥♥♥♥ing 7. I've revealed 70% of the universe, defeated everything there is to defeat and I was allowed to proceed with the 2nd mission of this game.   It's fun tho. I wouldn't be so devoted if it wouldn't be worth it.
8517	1	a	If you have not bought this game, wtf are you waiting for?
8519	1	a	What isn't fun about flying around and blowing stuff up?  This game is fun, but gets a bit repetitive.
8521	1	a	SPAZ is like an updated Escape Velocity. Thomas approves.
8523	1	a	A great little game. The combat is fun and the visuals are nice. It can get a little repetitive, but the game throws some gameplay changes in later in the game.
8525	1	a	Do not let the price of this rare gem fool you, Because the content this game can offer is well worth more! SPAZ is a fantastic, well-made game developed by only two people who had a dream and made it reality, Creating a stepping stone for others to do the same. After 300+ hours into this game, Here's my experience so far.  PROS:   1. What initially brought me to this game was how alive it felt, With something always going on around every corner of the galaxy. There are many events and little side-missions that make it feel like it's a living, breathing environment  2. While on the surface the mechanics look simple, there is a surprising amount of depth put into how you can personally tailor and customize your ships to your own liking, Giving you the chance to get creative and make many different layouts and strategies on how you want to play.  3. The exploration, With the choice of either a minimum of 150 stars or a maximum of 300 stars, You can set the pace at which you play the game to your own standards. Regardless of what you choose, It takes a considerable time to explore each and every different system, Giving you a reasonable space to scavenge for tech that you may need.  4.The combat, the main focus of this game, Is very engrossing and addictive. The controls are tight, The gameplay is fluid and it's all easy to pickup, But hard to master. From blasting your enemies away with cannons to steadily melting them to scrap from far away, There's plenty of options for you to take down your enemies. (Or civilians, if you're not in the most merciful mood!)    CONS:  1. The game can become very repetitive, With most side-missions being recycled, And many tasks needing to be done in order to progress with reputation.  2. It can feel very grindy, especially early on in the game when you need to farm resources and levels if you ever get stuck on a quest.  3.    The Zombies in the game can become very tedious to clear out later on in the game,       This game has brought me tons of priceless joy, I hope I had shared some of that experience with you all, Because even with all that I said, I still can't express or put into words how much I love this game, Thank you for reading this far, Have a pleasant day.
8527	1	a	Great game!. And It's an Indie title so you know the two (yes two) people who worked on it really gave a full effort. And it shows. I totally reccamend purchasing this game.
8529	1	a	Mighty good fun so far.
8531	1	a	If you loved the space shooter games of yore then this is a dream come true! Customize your own fleet, purchase new tech, ally or betray two factions and prepare for a massive galatic zombie infestion!
8533	1	a	This game is fantastic. Lots of customization and different ways to blast through. sense of freedom and accomplishment when you figure things out. I'm barely into it but I'm recommending it to anyone I know or game with. Looking forward to future titles from these people.
8535	1	a	when I had this game I really loved it during the time that it was free, but when the free time ran out I was very dissapointed to find the I had to end up paying for it. Maybe another like one free day sale but hvae me not ever having to pay for it.  Besids all that, Its a really great game :D
8537	1	a	A great little game. The combat is fun and the visuals are nice. It can get a little repetitive, but the game throws some gameplay changes in later in the game.
8539	1	a	This is a game with a great core gameplay loop - load up a couple of ships with various items and fly them around frantically through a swarm of other ships blowing stuff up. The action-oriented 2D combat is great fun, with surprisingly great physics and object interaction for such a seemingly simple game. The fact that the plot and the elements in play radically changes halfway through the game is a bonus, and works great even though the zombies are spoiled by the game's actual title.  There are a few issues I had with the game though. Grinding for resources and data can be quite a hassle - the less you grind, the harder the combat is, because your equipment simply won't be as good. Updating your tech RPG-style is really compelling, but unfortunately not every tech is created equal. Techs all cost the same, but it seems clear to me that investing 50+ skillpoints in, say, Hull strength or Shields is vastly preferable to investing the same amount of points in something like Bombs (a really specific type of weapon) or Crew (only situationally useful). Maybe this depends on playstyle, but I tried investing in things like Subsystems or Launchers at first and found the benefits just weren't as tangible.  Also, for a game that probably takes even experts 30+ hours to complete, the fairly small number of mission types gets old fairly quickly.  That said, the core gameplay is really fun and made it worth it for me, and the sense of progress you get teching up and defeating fleets that would have smeared you to a paste several hours earlier is tangible and rewarding. If you've got a lot of time and like a simple 2D action game, give this a shot!
8541	1	a	It gets a bit grindy, but it's still a fun game.
8543	1	a	Simply fantastic. If you are looking for a good old 2D space adventure game where you can: a) Unlock many different ships, weapons and components, b) Upgrade various aspects of your ships, c) Be a pirate and prey on civilian ships, d) Bribe officials and manipulate relations with the police or the civilians, e) Use a massive battleship to blast a starbase to pieces and collect the loot because you didn't want to pay them for it, f) Participate in bounty hunter battle events and win their respect, g) Use this respect to order the bounty hunters to attack a warp gate blockade for you, h) Fight zombies, i) Battle squads of enemy ships and blow them to bits, and pick up the jettisoned crew to join your ranks, j) Rampage through the galaxy and cause general chaos in each individual solar system... then you should buy this game.  The devs said that they created SPAZ because they couldn't find games like it anymore. This is sadly true, but now you can play this game so it's all okay. It is not the most fast-paced or the most action-packed game (although big battles are quite exciting) but it doesn't try to be. It is just a completely amazing space adventure that lets you choose where to go next and what to do when you get there.  You are let loose in a galaxy that you design (for the most part), and you are free to explore solar systems, mess around with politics, and level yourself up so you can venture into harder areas. To get to a new system you have to either destroy the UTA (police) warp gate blockade, bribe them with goons, or use bounty hunters to clear the blockade for you. You can then continue to the next system, and because there is no communication between systems, the people there will have no clue what you have been up to. In each system there are small, basic missions that you can do, and occasionally a conflict pops up between the two sides, which you can join in.  There IS a storyline, which is quite intriguing, but the story missions are relatively few and quickly jump to much harder areas. You have to explore and level up before continuing on, but you can do the story whenever you really want, or if you get bored of exploring all the other solar systems, because they are mostly the same, and when you have acquired all of the blueprints that you get from lower-level systems, there is not really much need to go all the way around the galaxy. But it's still fun to go to every place, especially if you are someone who loves exploration.  There are lots of ships of varying sizes and all of them are designed for a different purpose. You can easily change between ship designs and equip different weapons and support modules. Later on in the story you get more hangars, which means more ships. You can only control one at a time but you can freely swap between them, and the AI controls the others. You can give orders to your AI-controlled ships, although they can be pretty frustratingly stupid sometimes. Especially when armed with huge bombs, because they fire them off everywhere as soon as they reload, usually causing high damage to you or friendly ships, which quickly turn hostile.  Combat ranges from not-all-that-interesting with smaller ships, to exciting, lasers-and-giant-explosions when several large ships are pitted against each other. Many small details have been perfected in this game, some of which are: shockwaves from exploding ships will damage anything that is too close, and firing on one side of a ship will wear down the armour and allow you to deal more damage, as well as causing minerals and crew members to be sucked out into space through breaches in the hull.  Yes, there are zombies in this game. They are found in the central solar systems. They are very annoying (they have a tendency to split and create more, and there are lots of them) and can be dangerous and head to deal with if you are not careful. Luckily, both the Civs and the UTA hate the zombies as well, and there are often conflicts between zombies and one or both of them.  The graphics are nice, the backgrounds are nice, the ships all look nice, the explosions are nice, sound effects are nice, everything I have mentioned previously in this review is nice. You might not like this type of game and that's fine, but if you are remotely interested in the concept then you should definitely buy it. The price is overly reasonable, especially on sale. Recommended.
8545	1	a	I really enjoy this game a whole bunch. It's lik Escape Velocity without the trading. If you find trading tedious, this is a great game. Just finding things and making money without dieing too much. It's just fun to play. A pleasure to move the ship around, I mean. The upgrading and items are all very nice as well.
8547	1	a	Oh good Lord, make me a son and I'll name it SPAZ 2!
8549	1	a	You are in space.  You do pirate-y things.  There are zombies involved.  Bounty hunters are jerks.  This game is fun.  Can't wait for SPAZ2. 
8551	1	a	This game started maybe a bit boring but it became better and better every minute i playd. Several twists and changes kept me entertained for more than 50 hours. Definitly a great game with lot of fun.
8553	1	a	Runs Flawless and For the low price tag and the extreme amount of content included its a crime. Get this Game and you can go on a spree of your very own!
8555	1	a	All altogether billiant mix of fleet tactics and trigger-happy WASD action that will leave you wondering where this game was for the last 10 years. SPAZ evokes nostoligic memories of Solar Winds and Star Control -- games from a simpler time, but adapts with beatiful graphics, fast and liquid gameplay, and well-placed rpg elements. With a name that includes the word Zombies, I passed on the game originally, but it's quietly short-listed its way into my heart, and onto my top 5 indie games of the year.
8557	1	a	This game delivers on what it says, Zombies - check, pirates - check, space - check. Most honest game this year.
8559	1	a	Very fun game with a unique sense of humor, something one only gets from indie developers. Well worth the price (its dirt cheap!).  
8561	1	a	One of the nicest indie game I've ever played. You destroy ship to get XP and ressources to buy bigger, better ships to be able to destroy more ships. Each planetary system has 2 factions, and you can choose one faction or the other in each system. Later in the game, you can destroy some zombie ships, and it gives a little more challenge to the game. There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough. There is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot. I've played 24 hours and I still haven't finished the game because I need to grind the XP and the ressources to go further in the game. It's truly a good game and I had a lot of fun playing it but it takes a lot of time to finish.
8563	1	a	A game about Space... Pirates and Zombies, what more could you want?! But in all seriousness this is a very good and enjoyable game. It brings back many good memories from my gaming-past. The graphics are very neat for a 2D game, there's humor and lots of finetuning options for your ships. High replayability and easy to start up and play for a short while and on the other hand you can also completely forget about time playing this game. Fell in love with this game during the tutorials.  Also the devs are actively talking with the community on both the steam forums and the official SPAZ forum.
8565	1	a	The game is beautiful, colours, graphics, gameplay is astounding. Personally for me, I got over 14 hours in during the first week of play. the game has great continous play, and replayability, much similar to the 'roguelike', that is Dungeons of Dreadmoar. It is enjoyable, although ti could be better, For such a spectacularly low price that it is, it's a steal, and it's worth every second.
8567	1	a	A wondeful game in the Star Control genre, has some nice twists, a self managed difficulty, cool 2d graphics, some soundbites to chuckle over and ZOMBIES.. how could you resist..  Highly recommended
8569	1	a	Solid 40 hours of gameplay for an indie space opera style game; fun to play and build up a fleet, worth getting as a 'pick up and play' game for an hour or two at a time.
8571	1	a	This game is still entertaining even after having it for this long!
8573	1	a	an extremely addictive game with unique gameplay mechanics!
8575	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I'm normally one of those wimps who only plays on the easiest settings but this game only gets better the hard you make it. Max the bounty hunters and the difficulty level and you will enjoy the fight of your life.
8577	1	a	Most addicting game I've played in a while.
8579	1	a	Amazing game. So much to do and the fun never dies. Plenty of upgrades new ships and good story line also replayability make this a must buy.
8581	1	a	A solid game and a good time Sync. Cant wait for SPAZ 2
8583	1	a	What can I say? Brilliant. Simple. Ok, well this game is the kind that you can return too again and again. Randomly created game every time and a great ship/customise inventory. Controls are simple enough and the early game balance is gentle but with enough challenge to get you hooked. All in all I cannot recommend it enough.
8585	1	a	Great game. Top down two dimensional view arcade-y space sim-lite. A mouthful!   Side with the UTA (the established military forces) or the civilians of countless star systems while keeping safe from zombies and bounty hunters in your quest to the core of the universe. Power up your ships, find blueprints and build new ones, customize them with a variety of weapons and systems, or maybe just mine asteroids until your eyes bleed. It's your choice, and it's deep enough to be engaging but not so deep as to completely ward off newbies.
8587	1	a	Excellent game, top down space warfare reminiscent of Star Control. Highly recommend the game. Has an entertaining storyline also.
8589	1	a	Without a doubt the best space themed title I have played. I LOVE this game. I cant wait for SPAZ 2 to come out.
8591	1	a	It's a game about space pirates and then later there's zombies and now there's bounty hunters.  What else do you even need in life.
8593	1	a	So, I've got lots of very expensive big budget games in my little library. This little indie game is much better, and played far more often then many of them.   It puts you in command of a little squad of ships, one of which you control directly. You hop around from system to system doing jobs for factions and trying to upgrade you ships.   The ships are very configurable, and there are quite a few of them to play around with.   All of this is very addictive. I've blinked and realised a couple of hours have flown by while I've been hopping accross the galaxy looking for that next level reactor part, or missle launcher, or new hull.   The size of the galaxy is configured at the start of the game, and a huge galaxy is really huge. Looking back at that statement, it sounds funny, but it's true :).   If you find the whole zombie craze very tired (like myself), don't be put off by the fact that it's in the title of this game. The zombies aren't really a 'more brains' kind of thing, but more like the reavers in the movie Serenity.  I've gotten a lot of value out of this game. I really don't think you can go wrong if you decide to pick it up.   Oh, and they're working on spaz 2 right now. Yay :). 
8595	1	a	Best space top-down view game I've played in a very long time. I've spent hours and hours playing this game. This game is very indepth, ship customization is great, and the story is incredible. I would recommend this game to anyone how likes...playing games. You have the option to have two AI ships follow you around while you do missions, or take control of one of those ships to diversify the way you play (or when your main ship explodes). There are numerous missions to do, at times it does get repetitive, but the intensity does increase as you plan on with loot to take. There are a lot of solar systems that you can visit, and the way you interact with each faction helps determine, what weapons are readily accessible for you to purchaes or scavenge. Down side: I have to wait tooo long for the sequel.
8597	1	a	'If any of the hostages give you any lip, throw em out the airlock with the rest of the trash.'   Space Slaver Sim 2011, 10/10 would buy again.  Seriously though, I regret not picking this up before. Its a 2D isometric space ship pew pew game that kind of tends to lead you along with the promise of new and better ships and upgrades, but along the way teaches you the complexity of said upgrades and combat. The only downfall I'd say it has is the repetitive ambient chatter, and the godawful character faces/avatars, but then again it was made by just two people.   I'm going to put a lot more hours into this. Highly recommended.
8599	1	a	SPAZ is a really awesome game. Really simple to learn, but rewarding once you get into it a lot. A great time waster, but fun too.
8601	1	a	Unique and very worth the purchase.
8603	1	a	Best game ever! Couldn't stop playing... And the price is so low. Totally worth it!
8605	1	a	A game that just about has everything cool in games.  It has Pirates! 'Arrg!' It has Zombies! 'Brains!' It has Civilians! 'Please don't shoot me!' It has Military! 'STOP! We'll shoot!'  And also Bounty Hunters! 'All your rez belongs to us!'  Get it now! Before there's no resource left and the zombies have eaten you alive! ;)
8607	1	a	A wondeful game in the Star Control genre, has some nice twists, a self managed difficulty, cool 2d graphics, some soundbites to chuckle over and ZOMBIES.. how could you resist..  Highly recommended
8609	1	a	Solid 40 hours of gameplay for an indie space opera style game; fun to play and build up a fleet, worth getting as a 'pick up and play' game for an hour or two at a time.
8611	1	a	This game is still entertaining even after having it for this long!
8613	1	a	One of the nicest indie game I've ever played. You destroy ship to get XP and ressources to buy bigger, better ships to be able to destroy more ships. Each planetary system has 2 factions, and you can choose one faction or the other in each system. Later in the game, you can destroy some zombie ships, and it gives a little more challenge to the game. There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough. There is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot. I've played 24 hours and I still haven't finished the game because I need to grind the XP and the ressources to go further in the game. It's truly a good game and I had a lot of fun playing it but it takes a lot of time to finish.
8615	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I'm normally one of those wimps who only plays on the easiest settings but this game only gets better the hard you make it. Max the bounty hunters and the difficulty level and you will enjoy the fight of your life.
8617	1	a	Love this game. Is definitely one of my all-time favorites. Don't get enough time to play it.
8619	1	a	Another instant classic. Perfect mix of arcade, strategy and tactics.
8621	1	a	An amusing little title which took me by surprise. Lots of content and many many many different ways to play. I find this game to be wildly entertaining and it will run on a toaster.
8623	1	a	Action game with significant RPG like progress system.  You control one ship of 2-4 ship group. The other ships follow yours around, you outfit all of your group with shields, weapons, engines etc. that you unlock as you progress.  I found significant time spent farming was required, although the combat is the heart of the game, so that wasn't too big a problem.  The story is nothing special. Graphics are fine for an indie game. This game is for those looking for a spaceship squad based ARPG.
8625	1	a	can't shake this game. just a top-down rpg with fun upgrades and some cool as ♥♥♥♥ physics. of course i wish there were more factions and resources and economy mechanics, but then i tell myself to stop being such a puss. and right now it's just a dollar ninety nine anyways. i drink that in beer in thirty seconds.
8627	1	a	A solid game and a good time Sync. Cant wait for SPAZ 2
8629	1	a	Very reminiscent of the old EV games and appeals to my OCD.
8631	1	a	This game deserves more popularity.
8633	1	a	This is one of my favorite indie games on Steam - a true gem. Even though it's made by a two-man team, this is an awesome 2D space combat game. It's not laden with overly complicated interfaces and rule systems like a lot of strategy games, yet has enough customizability and complexity to keep the player engaged. Ignore the story, and focus on configuring your ships. My 40 hours on a single playthrough is proof of how much fun I had. Some may find the combat repetitive eventually, but I found the steady trickle of new weapons enough to keep me invested. I love this game and am very excited for the sequel!
8635	1	a	I ended up putting in way more hours than I ever thought I would in playing this game. All in good fun, though. It's a good top down space shooter with a lot to do, some quirky humor, and several different ways of playing (though maybe only a few work best in Insane difficulty -- canons and stealth are your friend until you build up the tech to face things head on). It can be a bit grindy at times, especially when you get to the Zombies part of the title, as you'll want to acquire powerful tech and ship blueprints to deal with them (and this goes double especially on Insane difficulty). But, if you get into it, you'll barely notice all the time pass until you've suddenly put in over 100 hours.   A good, well-put together game at a cheap price. Worth the full price. A no brainer when on sale. :)
8637	1	a	Worth a try, surprisingly addictive.
8639	1	a	Great mix of dogfighting action and strategy, with RPG elements and a fair amount of flexibility without being overwhelming. The 'fleet' of ships you pilot is greatly overstated though. I was disappointed when I found that I still only had access to 4 ship hangars at the end of the game.
8641	1	a	Simple, easy-game to learn how to play that is engaging, thrilling, and full of plenty of explosions. You could call it a simple, mindless shooter, however the way the developers present the story-line, different quests and plenty of gear-ships to experiment with, I would give it more credit than a simple shooter. PS: cannot wait for SPAZ 2 (please have workshop)
8643	1	a	A good game till the end im level 109 and still can't defeat the boss. The curve the games takes after act 2 is huge. Prepair for trying the same mission over and over till you quit and never come back. :(  edit Well I did come back and I worked on leveling all the way to level 139 and at that point i was able to take out the boss in 30 secounds. That felt so good! 75 hours is good for 7.99 a bit grindy but it was very fun.
8645	1	a	As the Britishism goes, 'Does exactly what it says on the tin' You get space pirates and you get zombies.  Somehow this genre jumping game manages to capture real time space battles, resource management and zombies well.  Granted, the game suffers a bit from trying to do too much at once, but I would much rather a game try too much than not enough.  3.5/5
8647	1	a	Best game ever! Couldn't stop playing... And the price is so low. Totally worth it!
8649	1	a	A ton of fun at a low price. I only wish they'd come out with a sequel.
8651	1	a	Ive put 50 hours into this game. The difficulty spikes make it really hard to get the later tier ships that you absolutely need to stand a chance at progressing. Its a pretty fun game.
8653	1	a	Over all, this is one of my favorite games on steam. I was very surprised to see how much fun it all would be and I totally recommend giving it a try and if it goes on sell, you likely can't go wrong picking up a copy.  S.P.A.Z. reminds me a whole lot of one of my fav games of all time, EscapeVelocity. I remember playing EV on our Mac years and years ago. It left such a good impression that I watched the companies website like a hawk for almost a decade for signs of windows development, and promptly bought a copy.  There isn't any market trading in SPAZ, it's all about the combat and ship upgrades. And it's incredibly satisfying to finally unlock that next high capacity ship and beef up your little squadron and go tearing through hostile territories. I was delaying what I thought would complete the game, and then I finally went forward with the quest and realized that a whole new world of gameplay opens up toward the end of the game. It feels a little more tedious than the rest of the game, but still something I will go back and play quite often it was so much fun. The visuals are great, simple sprites unleashing very pretty particles of destruction all in front of really beautiful galactical backdrops. The music is more ambient and moody than pulse pumping 'ReallyBigSky' type stuff but it fits the situation very well.  There were a few mechanics that are sticking points because of how vaguely they're explained (if at all) and I played a great deal of the game blindly before I realized that mousing over systems would show me the info I wanted to know about them in a popup window (what type of exchange I can do there, and how much of that exchange I can do) without having to warp to each and every system and just trial-and-error it all out. So a word to the wise, watch those popup highlights change, they contain lots of time-saving info.
8655	1	a	A fun top down space adventure survival game. Run missions and and engage in piracy on a quest to the galactic core researching, salvaging, and stealing technology and ship types all along the way. It is great fun to tweak and optimize ship combinations and weapon loadouts, as well as dump excess crew into the void of space when the 'zombies' breach your hull.
8657	1	a	best ten bucks I ever spent. I've played nothing else for the past week.
8659	1	a	Pure awesomeness. Waiting for second SPAZ(ABH:)). Sad that the next one will not be in 2D, but we'll see...
8661	1	a	Pretty fun viddy oggem although TB does voice overs still worth playing
8663	1	a	Might not have actually played this game too much but the concept is worth buying by itself. I mean come on. PIRATES IN SPACE WITH ZOMBIES. Imagine Pirates of the Carribean combined with Shaun of the Dead but there is no gravity and it's set in every Sci-Fi universe ever. Think i've said enough.  10/10 would collect minerals again.
8665	1	a	The best space opera I've played since Master of Orion 2. Cuts back on the resource management of other games in its class and focuses more on the strategy of ship building and space combat. A great RPG with a pretty solid story that doesn't take itself too seriously.
8667	1	a	Super addictive space hot-rodding combat game. Very replayable due to generated universe. Low price for a lot of fun. Highly recommend!
8669	1	a	Awesome game, just awesome!
8671	1	a	I wish I could play this with controller, it is a fun shooter and more
8673	1	a	ITS JUST GOOD  
8675	1	a	Sweet game altogether! first game i accualy want to buy for once. found the cheats too which isn't too much of a cheat. hint hint hold alt f7
8677	1	a	The first few chapters are great; then the zombies become prominent. After that, it's tedious and repetitive.  I'm so tired of zombies. Take them away, please. Give me Space Pirates without Zombies (SPWOZ).
8679	1	a	Funny, creative, lots of replayability, great customization: One of the best 2D Spacesims I have played!
8681	1	a	I spent a great portion of this game anxious, asking, 'where are the zombies?' Do not fret, my friend. THERE ARE ZOMBIES. 10/10
8683	1	a	Go around the galaxy and do various jobs and grab minerals and upgrade your ships. Collect crew mans from defeated ships and make alliances and then backstab them.
8685	1	a	This is one of the best indie games I have ever played.
8687	1	a	This game is loads of fun and its challenging too. Tons of different ships to pilot and tons of upgrades to add to them also the writing is amazing props to devs for making such a funny game and very enjoyable.
8689	1	a	Very good game, I do wish that it would have been continued to be updated but I do hope that #2 will be even better with the hope of multyplayer. I have played with a few mods and it has seemed to have halted but who knows. Maybe there will be some kind of boost to this game once again.
8691	1	a	This game is highly underated. It's got a great feel to it, with tons of content and gameplay galore. And it can be hard too. Don't expect to breeze your way through, you're going to have to work for your reward. SPAZ is a great example of a good top down space shooter, and I can't recommend it enough.
8693	1	a	Simple, addicting and fun to play. I just gonna play for a couple minutes aaannnd it's 1:00 AM.
8695	1	a	I have played this game for over 100 hours. I reformatted my computer to get away from it. Try it!
8697	1	a	An endless grind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that goes absolutely nowhere.
8699	1	a	Bought this game before it was on steam, developer was nice to provide a steam key afterwards.  Played it for hundreds of hours, and then hundreds more when developer added mod support.  Heavily recommended to anyone who likes space, shooters, ship customization or Space Rangers.
8701	1	a	Incredible game, tons of fun. It's a pretty expansive space/shooter/explorer game with a few odd twists. Tons of stuff to do and explore and the sound effects are great. I've yet to beat this but it's been great game.
8703	1	a	This game is awesome.  Absolutely recommended.
8705	1	a	It's like a very simplistic Mount &amp; Blade game but with spaceships.
8707	1	a	If you were playing FTL and thought to yourself, 'This is great, but I need... MORE' Then Spaz is the game for you.  If you were playing Gratuitous Space Battles and thought to yourself, 'This is boring, I need... MORE' Again, Spaz is the game for you.  I want to stop playing it, but I can't. I have to conquer the galaxy, pirate-style. Incredibly addicting, and like FTL, ignore any and all dialogue. It's cute, but that's about it.  For $2, it's a must-have. For $10, you'll still get your money's worth. I give it an FTL out of GSB.
8709	1	a	On sale for $1.99?! Buy it!
8711	1	a	Asteroids meets Serious Sam?
8713	1	a	It is what it says in the title. ♥♥♥♥in'... come on, were you expecting mermaids?
8715	1	a	Top down spaceship grind. Mechanics are interesting. Be sure to keep an extra save. Can provide a good power trip or challenge depending on your progression.
8717	1	a	Great game, wish it was multiplayer. Picked this up in Humble Bundle (bought the bundle just for this) and was extremely pleased.   It's 2D top down. Zombies, pirates, and upgradeable space ships. Pretty neat concep and story line. Love the developers.   This game isn't for everyone, but there is no reason to hate on it. It's not the longest game ever, it does get repetitive in the end game.   I wish they had a version for Android. This game can run on really low spec systems and reminds me a lot of the first stages of Spore. It's a great simple game to have on the go that you can casually play and log off at a moments notice.
8719	1	a	Definatly a good game with decent replay value. If you have a few $$$ to spend- this wouldnt be a bad place to start.
8721	1	a	I have to say, it does bring back some of what I've missed about older games. I give it a 'yay'. :)
8723	1	a	This game is... weird. I'll recommend it, but ONLY if this is your type of game. I really like the premiss and everything of it, but the only problem is that... well, SPAZ never really hooked me. I really feel like it'll get much more intiguing if I continue playing it, but so far it just hasn't given me any big reason to do so.  Like I said, I'd recommend it if it's up your alley. Maybe it just wasn't up mine.
8725	1	a	You absolutely must buy this game. It's better than Ring Runner and certainly better than Galactic Arms Race. It's exactly what it sounds like, and so it's a bit to add much to the description. The mission variety is excellent as it combines storyline, side missions, and procedural mission generation. The universe is also procedurally generated so theres even some variety to the main storyline missions, resulting in excellent replayability.  I bought this with credit gained from selling Steam trading cards when it was on sale for $2. Not sure why I hadn't seen this game earlier.
8727	1	a	So far I'd say I have spent more time in the hangar costumizing my fleet and trying to figure out the best trade offs to be made than actually blowing up enemy ships. This game has a very decent variety of weapons, sub systems, mounts, armors, shields, engines and all that good stuff you can apply to your ships in order to costumize them. Ships of all classes and sizes are available (fighters, support ships, battleships, mining ships, mass bomb carriers), you just have to unlock them by a very simple unlock system (blow up the ship you want and collect its black box from the remains). The battles are fun and actually require you to maneuver your ship around in a strategic fashion in order to get the best from your beams, cannons, turrets...and also to avoid enemy fire. For a 2 man work, this game is a blast.
8729	1	a	If you miss the old flash game 'Starfighter: Disputed Galaxy' you will love this game.
8731	1	a	Crashed when I wanted to travel to the second planet 10/10
8733	1	a	Great time killer and great addition to your collection. Grab on a sale. Fun to cruize around space and blow ♥♥♥♥ up as well as upgrade your ships and items. I have been gaming for about 20 years +. This game would make my top 100. 6/10 (no game is perfect).
8735	1	a	Got this in a bundle -  https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly  for less than a dollar. Best money I ever spent!  It's a fun 2D space tactics/shooter,. lots of missions,. no really LOTS,. the map is pretty huge. Customization options, achievements, the list goes on.  Pretty good, worth getting.
8737	1	a	It is what it says in the title. ♥♥♥♥in'... come on, were you expecting mermaids?
8739	1	a	94 hours later i finished the game.  Had a lot of fun doing it too.   Should you get this game?  Yes. Yes you should.
8741	1	a	Very well made, funny and engaging storyline.  I can't say the game has great replayability - though I do like to replay it once every few years.   Sequel is out now, and while it's very different, it's just as enjoyable and if you like this I recommend it as well.
8743	1	a	I picked this up in the winter sale and I quite enjoy it. I remember playing a game called Star Control when I was a kid and SPAZ seems very keen to evoke those memories.  The bulk of the game is spent carrying out missions (i.e. quests) which will reward currency and/or reputation with each system's faction. Speaking of which, each system has two sides: UTA (Empire) and Civilians (Rebels). You don't always have to butter up one or the other, and which side you'll have to ♥♥♥♥ off will vary from system to system. It's very much up to you how and where you want to go questing, but the levelling process can feel a bit grindy.  The combat is fun but not overly deep, and things can get a bit repetitive. I've put 30 hours into it so far and I've only really just got into the meat of the campaign I think. At a sale price, I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at 50% off so anything else is a bonus.  p.s. If you're on the fence, TRY THE DEMO. It's a good taster.
8745	1	a	I finished this game to 100% any enjoyed every bit of it!
8747	1	a	I fraken love this game, Awesome graphics and game play. love the ship customization.
8749	1	a	Awesome music themes and atmosphere. Nice tech progression and customizable weapons.  Very fun. SPAZ2 out hopefully this year - sweeet
8751	1	a	My alltime favorite schmup game. What is better than Pirates? Space pirates obviously. And what about adding a helping of zombie apocolypse? Command a small fleet of customized ships running missions with epic space battles with resource management &amp; technolgy unlocks. Solve your rather straightforward objectives through a variety of approaches (most of which revolve around decideding who to blow up). No one-way decisions or trade-offs here, full respec and the ability to recover from most blunders. All the while treated to a somewhat funny plot, over-the-top characters and excellent ambiance.  
8753	1	a	Definitely a fun game. Worth getting at any price. The game mechanics are easy to learn and the curve for skill does come in to play against the harder computers and in the arenas. And you get to kill Bounty Hunters, always fun!
8755	1	a	Awesome, Nuff Said.
8757	1	a	Simple and Addictive. A great buy.
8759	1	a	Fantastic game.   Fun,   Resource management.   Did I mention it is fun?
8761	1	a	i loved this game now spaz2 is early access. BACKAROO BONZAI !!!!

8765	1	a	35 hours says it all, you'll get addicted, beware there's a sequel coming! You'll want to beat that too!
8767	1	a	Pretty fun game. 8.5 out of 10
8769	1	a	Wait for it to go on sale. It is a realy good game, just don't pay full price. 
8771	1	a	This game is beyond awesome. It's a little mix of Space Rangers, Freespace and Elite with a great story and a TON of content made by a tiny 2 developer team who created SPAZ because no one else was making games like this anymore. Support indie devs and support one of the best genres of games that has all but died off in the age of 3D graphics. Buy SPAZ now! I mean it.
8773	1	a	Pretty fun game. 8.5 out of 10
8775	1	a	VENT ALL THE ATMOSPHERES!
8777	1	a	Fantastic game for the money, highly recomended, the controls and concepts easy but the game isnt. a real challenge buy this when its on sale.
8779	1	a	SPAZ is really well made. Seems like you can play it for a long long time. There is as always a lot to learn in a Space game like this, but the learning curve evens out quickly and the game shines after that. It's something akin to Master of Orion from back when the dinosaurs ruled the arcades, but then again it's a lot of things not similar at all. Even with a small production team they have been able to create quite the amount of content. I can't wait to see if it keeps up the surprises and if wether or not it scales well. Cheap game, big world to explore, many hours of fun, and the devs hope to upgrade the game with more goodies in the future. Thumbs up from me.
8781	1	a	This game is highly addictive, I've been caught playing this in the office a few times. And yes because of the low pc requirements, I've been able to sneak in some playtime of this game. Give it a spin if you see it in a free weekend/steam sale, I can guarantee that you'll have a blast with it.
8783	1	a	A whole lot of fun
8785	1	a	enjoy what it attempts and how it's all put together, balance the part that seems wobbly... or maybe it's my shipwright and space captaining skills
8787	1	a	Earlier it came to my attention that none of my friends own this game, so I am here to inform. Space Pirates and Zombies is an open-world, 2D space-themed shooter and everyone should buy this game. Not only is it amazing that a team of two created this, but they did a really good job on it. They did a better job than some large game corporations have done on games before. Amazing combat, soo much to do, hilarious dialogues, really cool story, and you have ultimate control of how you get to point B. You can power your way through, or take your time and get everything one step at a time, just depends how you like to play. This game is for all styles of gamer and you should get it! (The intro screen made me type that D:)
8789	1	a	addictive game
8791	1	a	Oh I love this game soooo much......  I give it two thumbs up......
8793	1	a	
8795	1	a	shoot many things so good
8797	1	a	its repetitive fun
8799	1	a	A 2d Eve Online meets Subspace meets...Asteroids?  Game took a little bit to grab me, but it's loads of fun.
8801	1	a	One hell of a game!!!
8803	1	a	Great game! If you have the chance to gt this game and pass... well you just screwed yourself then!!
8805	1	a	Fun simple space game. Control 2-4 ships of different sizes which you can customize a little (i.e. choose weapons and features according to specific spots). Each system basically has an oppressive government group and rebellious civilian group. They’re relationship with you depends on the system and your actions. You may enter one system where the government loves you and the civilians hate you, then move into the next system where the gov. hates you and the civies love you, then the next system they both love you. You actions in one system does not affect the others. The missions in each system will affect your relationships in that system so be careful. Unique game, fun to play.   Pros - Each game is randomly generated so your experiences will always be different. - Simple to learn/play  Cons - The story doesn’t necessarily enthrall you but its there.  
8807	1	a	Buy this game, seriously, do it now. Had it for 2 days and ranked up 13 hours of gameplay already and by the looks of things I'm not even half way though the game yet. Different layout each time you play though due to randomly generated maps. There is a little message that pops up at the start of the game that explains that it was made by two guys working out of their homes for 2 years but how it plays you would think it was made by a standard developer.
8809	1	a	A whole lot of fun
8811	1	a	Fantastic game for the money, highly recomended, the controls and concepts easy but the game isnt. a real challenge buy this when its on sale.
8813	1	a	i played a lot of this game and its pretty good
8815	1	a	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIYYRRRRHHHH  Ship destroyed.
8817	1	a	One hell of a game!!!
8819	1	a	All in all a pretty decent game with enough challange to keep you going
8821	1	a	RTS? Yeah I suck at this.
8823	1	a	The name of the game says it all.Your in the vastness of space trying to get by with your crew being forced to have to build urself a small armada to defend yourself.   The game has Ship building/customizing, research/upgrades,exploration,factions,great dialog (radio chatter). Fantastic atmosphere,lovely graphics,intense fights,challening AI, the works. And oh yea HAS frakking aliens that are pretty much as braindead as a zombie is that live on pure drive. Infected ships and other treats are all in the inner parts of the galaxy you happen to be in.  Yes there are space sectors of a galaxy you are in that you go through in the campaign.Like most Strat games the mission can be a bit repetitive but its the fights the make it worthwhile.
8825	1	a	There is a bit of a learning curve up front, but this game is a gem once you get going. Along the lines of Starscape (which I've previously recommended), you are gradually exploring the galaxy using small ships deployed from a larger mothership. As you go, you will develop relationships with local civilian or military factions, fighting missions for them to gain experience and advance your research. Upgrade all aspects of your mothership and deployable crafts, and iteratively gain the ability to explore more of the galaxy.   Oh yes, and there's zombies, too. Good times.
8827	1	a	An interesting space shooter with some twists. The customisation is great, the way to unlock new hulls is great, and I can guarantee that once you're past the tutorial missions you'll be spending hours on this baby.
8829	1	a	This game wasn't really worth of my money even though it was a 75% off deal. I played it for about 3-4 hours but it didn't really interest me after that. Guess these kind of games with all that grinding and stuff isn't for me then ._. But i like pokémon... There's a lot of grinding there.  But That doesn't mean i shouldn't recommend it, because i'm sure there's a lot of people who's searching and wanting to play a game like these. So recommending isn't really my choice cause i don't know every gamer in the world. Bai!
8831	1	a	I traded a GayMod steam gift for this game and let me tell you that it was well worth it.  This game is sort of like an online game i've played for like 7 years: Darkorbit except that spaz is a singleplayer game unlike darkorbit, in darkorbit you are overwhelmed by cheaters left and right.   What i like about the game:  - Really RPG like, i LOVE RPG's - You have to plan out a strategy before you go guns ablazin or else you'll end up mining for rez for the next half hour to repair you're fleet - Doesn't take me 5 hours to beat the game, i can see myself sinking 20+ hours into this game   What i don't like about the game:  - Low amount and repetitive missions - Not much to do except whoop some ♥♥♥ and mine rez - The solar system is BIG but not big enough, WE NEED BIGGER!!!!! - Small amount of ship classes you can choose from - Small amount of weapons you can choose from   Other thoughts:  It'll be REALLY cool if you could upgrade you're weapons for example, having a level 1 mining lazer and paying to get it to level 2 so it might be 1% faster or have a longer burst. Over all this is a REALLY fun game, highly recommend it.
8833	1	a	This is a ton of fun!!! Try the demo. I fell in love with it. Reminds me of FreeSpace in a 2d kind of way. Open gameplay and lots of stuff to do. Along with a fairly interesting story. Looks great and is smooth on my PC as well. Highly impressed.
8835	1	a	addictive game
8837	1	a	Great game. Replay value is high, too.
8839	1	a	Never thought a Indie-Game for about 5€ could cost me more than 100 hours
8841	1	a	I traded a GayMod steam gift for this game and let me tell you that it was well worth it.

8843	1	a	Decent little space RPG, shooter thing. Good for a few laughs and some action.  Just don't make your galaxy huge! Really, just don't! Everything in moderation, you know! Not enough varied content to fill such a big balloon.  8 / 12
8845	1	a	Great game. Replay value is high, too.
8847	1	a	Never thought a Indie-Game for about 5€ could cost me more than 100 hours
8849	1	a	WYSIWYG: Space, Pirates and Zombies (and Bounty Hunters)!
8851	1	a	Spaz 2 now? yes?
8853	1	a	It's ok
8855	1	a	Can't wait for the sequel.
8857	1	a	7/10
8859	1	a	Space Rangers 3!
8861	1	a	Fun space shooter/RPG. Fly your starships around blowing up enemy ships and gathering resources to buy upgrades and bribe your way into new star systems! Try and get to the center of the galaxy to solve the mystery of the space-zombies!
8863	1	a	Great game, really deep. Hope the second one comes soon.
8865	1	a	What more could you want?
8867	1	a	One of my all time favorites ^.^
8869	1	a	SPAZ is a top-down space shoot-em-up that has pretty graphics and some nice RPG/upgrade elements for a variety of unlockable spacecraft. It's a great game to play when you need to kill some time, but the repetitive missions keep it from being much more than that. However, SPAZ is a great companion to FTL: Faster Than Light; where FTL requires you to adequately manage infrastructures amidst turn-based combat, SPAZ does that ♥♥♥♥ for you, and lets you just kill things in real-time until you get bored.
8871	1	a	Trully awesome! :D
8873	1	a	The game plays a little like asteroids mixed with FTL, but words can't do it much justice. go play it.
8875	1	a	It has pirates. It has zombies. It's in space. 10/10
8877	1	a	.
8879	1	a	SPAZ is fun, suprisingly complex, and chock full of quirky, lightheared humor. Fans of games like Star Control 2, Privateer and Vega Strike will feel right at home, and even those who aren't should give it a shot if they're a fan action games with rpg elements.
8881	1	a	10/10.
8883	1	a	i dont even remember playing this game.. it isnt even in my library, yet it still says i've played it? wat i guess i'll recommend it, even though i havent (or remember) played it before
8885	1	a	I love the game its just i wish i had a copy to play wtih.
8887	1	a	can someone help me mod this
8889	1	a	This game is cool.
8891	1	a	Excellent fun, eminently playable, sandbox with story, I love it
8893	1	a	I liek getting spaced out.
8895	1	a	Seroiusly fun, endlessly addictive!
8897	1	a	A bit of slow start but after about an hour or two it really picks up. Plenty of ships to choose from and the customization is good. The leveling system is a little poor, though. The farther you get in an upgrade tree, the more level-ups will be required to acquire a single upgrade.
8899	1	a	This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet. The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.  Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...
8901	1	a	Much fun! Basically kind of an Asteroids RPG, but with more action! Good game!
8903	1	a	Just got this game over the xmas sale. I've really impressed with it! Great fun, a bit of a challenge, and it'll offer hours of good fun.
8905	1	a	80/100
8907	1	a	Damn this is fun! A simple space exploration with arcade style top-down space battles. It has successfully drawn me away from serious RPGs for many hours.
8909	1	a	SPAZ is a pretty awesome game and is best described as a mix of arcade action mixed with roleplay elements, a genre that seems to be dead these days sadly. It is very enjoyable to cruise around and upgrade your stuff, the small storyline holds everything together, and for the rest you have precodurally generated galaxies which gives the game a welcome randomized feel.  Can't see a reason why anyone shouldn't like this game.
8911	1	a	This game feels like Diablo in space with lasers and missiles! Very fun to play
8913	1	a	Everything you want in a PC game. It is like MOO and SC combined.
8915	1	a	Game rocks! I bought it for 2 bucks and put 50 hours in it. I love the different ships you can aquire and there's so many builds and ways to play! The is a blast to play and the controls are great. It's a really arcade-y feeling game but there's so much depths and upgrades to get (and the upgrades aren't just linear ones).
8917	1	a	This game is a lot of fun even though it gets really repetative towards the end. The controls feel good, the upgrades and unlocks feel varied and worthwhile, and can go from really easy to insanely hard. I can recommend this at full price.
8919	1	a	This is a pretty good game for old school fans of games like Escape Velocity. Unfortunately the game doesn't do a very good job at immersing you like some of those older games do. The universe feels pretty shallow, and some of the tackier interface and portrait artwork can break immersion. Although many aspects are quite antiquated, the combat system is its redeaming factor, and is the primary focus of the game. I would suggest starting with a smaller sized galaxy since progressing through the game's story can drag on a bit and require more grinding otherwise.
8921	1	a	Crazy good indie game. Closest thing like it that I’ve played is Homeworld.
8923	1	a	TOO MUCH ADDICTION! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! It's like playing Civ.5 and wondering where 6 hours went.  So good, in the worst, time sucking, way.
8925	1	a	A nice blend of arcade and strategy with loads of stuff to discover. Also it reminds Spore with Galaxy Map and the goal to get-to-the-center.
8927	1	a	This is a really low-strategy 2d space action game. It's less strategic and more action-y than, for instance, AI War. I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of this game, but then a story event happens that causes you to lose all the territory you took, and at that point it wasn't worth it anymore. I don't know how it ends, and it's really not worth finding out.
8929	1	a	Spaceships, lasers, missiles, explosions and crewmen fighting off zombie boarding parties. Difficulty varies quite wildly depending on what gear you focus on, so there's plenty of scope for making the game a challenge. Customize your ships, build a little fleet and go pirating across the galaxy!
8931	1	a	
8933	1	a	This is a fantastic game. Great value, hours and hours of entertainment.
8935	1	a	If you like old school space shooters (asteroids) but like the story and graphics of modern space shooters (Halo) then this is the game for you
8937	1	a	A universe that everyone should experience. The combat is oh-so-fun, it's got a nice progression formula that everyone knows and loves by now, some story, great controls, and a lot of heart.  If you haven't, make sure to play SPAZ, it's a really great product!
8939	1	a	Awesome fun for the price. Looks simple but is has a ton of depth, research trees, custom ship outfitting and upgrading, mining, space pirating. Soon you'll have a small fleet of ships under your command and a huge galaxy to explore, do what you like or follow the story. Loving it!
8941	1	a	really great space fighting game with a good story
8943	1	a	Highly recommended.
8945	1	a	'The hull has been breached and the science is leaking out!' 'In space, no one can hear you scream... unless you're transmitting on the right radiowave frequency' 'If those hostages give you any lip you throw them out the window.'
8947	1	a	Fun 2D space shooter where you have up to 4 ships that you can customize any way you can think of (engines, lasers, rockets, shields, cloaks, reactors, boosters etc.) You can win with many different combinations so it fits with the style you want to play it in. Defidently a grinding, level up game.
8949	1	a	Hey you, yes you... if you gonna sell Space Pirates and Zombies 2, make it cheap! 'cause I'm gonna buy it.
8951	1	a	A game that combines a Asteroid esque type game. Enjoyable and repetitive. Still I can't recommend it enough, its only missing ninjas!
8953	1	a	I love this sort of game. if you die, its your own fault. you tried the mission, you get the reward of diying. also i love the fact that the first ships you get are extremely cheap. and you can go mining with those, and then... you stock up and get bigger ships. then bigger.. The even bigger. then you get huge.  get this. i havent bought it yet.  also, i SPAZed when i saw this. hehe.
8955	1	a	The dev said they didnt see any games of the kind and did it thenselves and did it GOOD , its not repetitive as some may describe (like a shooting game you have to shoot and that doesnt make it repetitive) has a very good storyline and playability is awesome , you have to kill a ship to use it or at late game it come by killing some other high level zombie. you get what u fight for and survive to harvest and atack!!!
8957	1	a	Definitely unique, the art is nothing to write home about but blasting through blockade after blockade is fun. For the first handful of times anyway. There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.  It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.  If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.
8959	1	a	Great game with a randomly generated universe. This game is worth the money
8961	1	a	An addicting Shooter RPG that on this rare occasion is not an FPS! SPaZ grants you limitless gameplay consisting of dogfighting, micro, and macro managing several elements throughout the vastness of the unending and randomely generated campaign.
8963	1	a	With an ongoing development and updating of the game, the game has a lot of re-playablitiy, a funny and entertaining story, varied difficulties and multiple types of missions in which you will play throughout the game.  Some parts near the end might be a little rince and repeat, but i have to say that for a game this cheap, it took me 66hours to finish the game. This was with standard difficulty and standard size of the galaxy. Having said that, i did not even explore everything even with those amount of hours played.  For people who want a different pace, and a game in which they can pick up and play from time to time. Then i can highly recommend SPAZ. It's fun, addictive at times, and it's also very easy to pick up even after not having played it for 2 weeks. 
8965	1	a	The goal of the two guys that made this game was to bring back a classic type of game that hasn't been seen in a while. They succeeded, and I'm glad they did. It's like Cosmic Rift with elements of Homeworld and EVE Online. It's surprising challenging and fun and it's worth buying just to help support the guys that made it.
8967	1	a	Surprising depth to the combat system, combined wih a bucket load of different hulls and components, and a thoughtful tech tree, and a variety of other well executed game mechanics, keep this game from getting old.
8969	1	a	Completely insane story, however with addictive, simple gameplay. Try it out when you can for cheap!
8971	1	a	One of the best 2D topdown space shooters, with A LOT of upgrades, many ships, a lot of exploring. If you are obsessive about stuff you might find your self wasting a lot of time on this, but it's a lot of fun so go for it.
8973	1	a	Surprisingly this is a very good indie game, one of the best I've played.  This is a real-time space shooter game that has some RPG and strategy elements in it. Combined together, it is actually a very addictive game that keeps you playing. You can have a fleet of up to 4 ships, and with it you gather resources, unlock new ships and technology, level up for talent points, trade with the 2 factions in the game to become more powerful. You can help or hinder either of the two factions, and the number of ships they can field in battle will increase or decrease, making your actions influence the galaxy.  The graphics, sound and story are decent enough, but the game-play is top notch.  As of this recommendation, the game is good enough despite being simple. But it could be so much more and the developers plan to add more content. If you have some spare change, consider buying it during a sale and help fund the sequel, SPAZ 2.
8975	1	a	This deserves to be on your Indie Games Done Right list. Spaz has you going around the galaxy fighting diffrent battles as a merc unit, you origionaly can only control 2 or so ships but eventualy can control 3, the sizes of the ships allowed changes as you play and there are a LOT OF SHIPS, around 8 for each of the 4 sizes. As you play the campaign you can unlock the various technologies, there being around 16 each with 10 levels, this making your ships more effective in that tech and unlocking the more advanced versions, the end result being an amazing amount of customization. Fun as hell game.
8977	1	a	spaz is a good game and is good graphics.  i like the gameplay andthe ships the graphics are great. 
8979	1	a	A fun game to grind and blow stuff up.
8981	1	a	closest thing to star control since star control
8983	1	a	I spent a fair amount of time with this version and pre-Steam version, combat is lots of fun with missiles, turrets and mining, game is very atmospheric, and you feel like you are in the groove in the early game. Then.. zombies. Difficulty curve goes way, way up, you die frequently, and start getting stuck in bottlenecks in the map where you have to defeat near-impossible odds to progress. Still, it won't be the first game I never finished but thoroughly enjoyed my time with until it beat the tar out of me.   Great game, sequel please....
8985	1	a	A great indie plenty of depth, choices and fun: one of the best mix of genres in a long time.
8987	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It does have too much grinding and the end game could of been done a lot better, but it still has a very addicting quality to it.
8989	1	a	I have about halfway through the game so far and it has been an enjoyable experience. The combat is fast and exciting. the ship movement is fluid and the game has plenty of content. For anyone looking for a 2D action space game you should really consider this game for the purchase.
8991	1	a	A great game, I enjoyed it a lot. Custom ship building, spaceship battles, different missions, some decision to make, enjoyable story. It might be a good idea to read through some tips on online wikis, so that you don't miss something important (the game doesn't always explain everything properly).
8993	1	a	This is really a good game. And, it's only about 150MB to install. It's a space exploration, resource gathering, space combat strategy. I'm not much into RTS games, and this game doesn't play like one. You have a mother ship, and then control individual ships in your fleet. You can switch between any ship, and also set up AI for those ships you aren't currently controlling. The galaxy is proceedurally generated when you start a new game, and you can control the number of star systems up to about 300 total. Each star system has a level requirement before you can visit it, and you have to deal with the ships guarding the Jump Gates (bribe or destroy) before you can move freely between systems you have access to.  Really, try the demo. The tutorial is for the first system but seems to open up after about the 1st or 2nd mission you take. This 2 person dev team deserve your money.
8995	1	a	This game is a rare indy gem, unlike most indie gems, this game has more gameplay in it than most games released these days. The story is laughable and hard to follow, something about upgrading your mothership and getting a laser or something, but it does take a pretty unexpected twist in the fourth act.   The meat of the game is VERY customizable ship combat. Outfit your increasingly powerful ships with lasers, cannons, missles, fighter drones, and more. The combat is great too, the Shield/Hull defences vs. Lasers/Projectiles mechanic requires carefull weapon loadouts, and as long as you keep your less than stellar AI comrades under a good leash, even overwhelming odds can be handled with skill.   Also, SPAZ is made by a two-man team who are just doing what they love, and buying this game helps them make the game better. SPAZ has added HUGE amounts of content since launch (Namely the Bounty Hunters) and will keep having content added if people keep supporting it.
8997	1	a	I really enjoy this game.
8999	1	a	An extremely addictive top-down space shooter combined with a lot of strategical elements that will last for dozens of hours. Excellent value for money and a great indie title :)
9001	1	a	I got this for free a few months back and finally gave it a try. Interesting game, it's like an RPG version of 'Asteroids'. You level up and customize your weapons as you go killng asteroids and pirates and zombies. Actually quite challenging and a great time sink.
9003	1	a	Try out this inde space shooter game.
9005	1	a	You gotta play this game!
9007	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
9009	1	a	Love games of this style, and glad to see one so well done. Some might feel it gets a bit repetitive at points, mostly when you have to grind up some levels to advance the main story, but it's still highly enjoyable gameplay. All of the tech upgrades, unlocking different ship types, and finding all of the weaponry blueprints keeps things exciting. It's a good price too.
9011	1	a	I recently purchased this game and I must say, I love it!   Dont judge it by its initial appearance. I mostly play games like X3 Albion Prelude which are 3d games with 6 point rotation. The more I played this game the more addictive it became. The game play is really good and entertaining not to mention it has lots of things to blow up. It doesnt require a powerful pc to run it either. It has plenty of help features and It was able to pretty much answer all my questions as I have played so far. Might I mention it also has a good story line to it so far and did I mention it has good explosions lol. If you love space games you will want this one as well. I am glad I purchased it. The price I paid was almost unfair to the developers of this fine game. Cheers!
9013	1	a	Very fun game, Another one of those cheap gems.
9015	1	a	Fun game to play when you have no internet
9017	1	a	Dont let the title of this game detour you, its a rather enjoyable mix of rts/rpg/shooter. Its also a bit openworld/sandboxish. You can appoarch the game in mulitple paths/play styles and what i enjoy most about it, is that it doesnt penalize players for making mistakes or trying sometihng new, in fact it encourages on the fly tatics and skill swaps. Download the demo and give it a shot. 3.5 out of 5 for a indie title.
9019	1	a	This is a damn good game. A wonderful old school space shooter with a lot of challenge. You will spend many hours in this game blowing up tons of others ships for their resources, their upgrades, or just to blow through their stargates. It can get a bit repeditive, but if you're experiancing that, then go to a system that's a higher level than you, and you will find yourself with more than enough challenge. I'm astounded by the quality of this two man made game, and I look forward to their updates, and anything else they make in the future.
9021	1	a	This is actually an amazing game if u can get accustomed to it's lack of AAA title polish. In other words, there's alot to enjoy in this game if you give it the chance. I'm hoping to get back to it when I finally finish some of the other games i've wanted to finish before this one.
9023	1	a	I collected this game.
9025	1	a	An updated Star Control for today's gamer. Well worth the money!
9027	1	a	Its a fairly solid game and a lot easier to get into then I first thought it would be. Building up your small fleet and customizing the parts on your ship is pretty fun, but after a while it does become a bit tedious. But for what it is, its a good game worth trying out and I look forward to what the developers brings in the future with this title under their belt.
9029	1	a	What sems to be a fairly simple game is actually pretty deep. It actually requires effort to move from stage to stage and one wrong step sends you back to the very beginning. If you like challenges and space this is a great game for you.
9031	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
9033	1	a	I really enjoy this game.
9035	1	a	Surprising depth to the combat system, combined wih a bucket load of different hulls and components, and a thoughtful tech tree, and a variety of other well executed game mechanics, keep this game from getting old.
9037	1	a	Strangely similar to EVE Online but without the other players and 20 mins to travel from one place to another. I was plesantly surprised by this game, and can see myself getting plenty of hours of enjoyment for a bargain price tag.
9039	1	a	This game could have been called Starscape 2 (see my review on Starscape, If you have played Space Rangers its also like a much better version of that game). Its very much similiar except quite a bit better. First of all you get 2 NPC ships that fight along side you which you can switch between. Second if you get stuck you can fly around to different areas and try to get better equip. They try to keep your direction open unless you want to advance the story, then you must accomplish certain tasks. Also requires salvage to unlock ships which is a neat idea. A bloody shame its only single player. This game is worth up to 10 dollars. If its 5 bucks don't miss it. On a side note the game was actually made by only 2 guys which is amazing.
9041	1	a	Worth it
9043	1	a	Possibly one of the best indie games of the year. Also it's only $5.
9045	1	a	I really like this game. Take 'astroids' and make it way cooler. Its one of those game i play until im sick of it and then put it away for awhile but always come back to and play. It can get a little repetative in that the map looks the same but i like the gameplay.
9047	1	a	On the surface, this may just look like Asteroids 2011. And yes, the 2D space battles are awesome and the control mechanics are good once you're used to them. But it's also part RPG: your ships as your characters, complete with loadouts, unlocks, and even skills via your tech research. And part RTS, via a rudimentary tactical screen where you can control your forces mid-battle. You unlock new ships by destroying someone else's model - even your allies' - and scouring the wreckage; piracy comes naturally in the game. Cuz hey... that's a beautiful new ship your 'valued comrade' just brought to battle. It'd be a shame if anything happened to it...
9049	1	a	For a game that was only made by 2 people, this does suprisingly well for an indie game. The randomly generated galaxies, vast number of missions, and the arcade style combat make for something that is rather retro, but awesome at the same time, because it combines space with zombies! Whats not to love?
9051	1	a	A Space Opera where politics involve: bribing, shooting first without asking questions, and shoving the occasional insubordinate crew member out the air lock. Suck it---Space.
9053	1	a	Fun retro space mining-shooting-something-something. It reminds me of the classic Starscape, but done even better. Very highly recommended!
9055	1	a	be pretty good if i new what i was doing :P
9057	1	a	great job to the developers. if you like a little bit of action, a little bit of harvesting, space travel, upgrading ships and weapons systems, trading with random encounters in space, and a well thought-out game with nice visuals, this is for you. the price is very fair for what you get and i would recommend it to anybody wanting some casual and progressive space fun. havent gotten to the zombies yet though :) definitely recommended
9059	1	a	6.5/10  SPAZ has an amazing demo, the full game however has a few shortcomings:  1. The mercenaries are just too damn powerful to fight and extort you at every opportunity (oh and you WILL NOT win that fight!) The game NEEDS an option to disable them! 2. The game revolves around grinding cash then bribing both fractions at EACH gateway. I’ll go guns blazing next time?? But I think the diplomacy route is too tedious. 3. Personally the fleet you have at the end, IMO just isn’t grand enough…  I kinda hope I’ll blast through this game again soon.  
9061	1	a	A really addictive spave RPG, A++
9063	1	a	Everything about this game works. It's fun, fluid, addictive and just really shockingly well done... and it was all done by two guys working from home. Brilliant game, worth your time and money.
9065	1	a	This game is easily one of my favorite Steam discoveries. Imagine a two-dimensional Freelancer and you're pretty close.
9067	1	a	Top down space shooter with RPG elements... and ZOMBIES!!!  Lots of fun, can be hard as hell sometimes
9069	1	a	A more than decent game that can suck you in fast.
9071	1	a	Really fun game, although it does not look appealing at first, it is a really good game, if you are into these kind of games that is.
9073	1	a	Very nice and cool space action. Kinda easy if you go slowly and cautious, but worth it anyway.  And besides it has zombies!
9075	1	a	Yay. It works.
9077	1	a	Wow, best $1.99 (Steam sale) I ever spent! Hours of fun, surprisingly deep, yet still 'casual' (easy to start and stop at any time) gameplay... the only problem is that it's so addictive, you won't want to stop for hours at a time. Bargain of the century!
9079	1	a	You get to explore space, customize and upgrade your fleet, and fight zombies.  Plus, Totalbiscuit is the narator.
9081	1	a	Probably one of the best sci-fi games I've played.
9083	1	a	It's a really good game for the price. It will take you a ton of hours to finish the game and the mechanics are really cool. The bad part is that the game requires lots of grinding some times and this is when the game might get boring, still you can change your spaceships hulls and customize their parts so its not that boring.
9085	1	a	This game is a wonderful blend of action, role playing, and horror elements.  You are part of a crew trying to get rich in the universe while generally aiding the local police/military forces (UTA) or rebels trying to shut them down (Civ). The entire game revolves around you doing pretty much whatever you want, but never making that easy.  The variety of ships is sure to appeal to pretty much everyone (Carriers, Battleships, Gunboats, and even a few cargo vessels) and the combat and ship customization is very, very well done.
9087	1	a	So there's nothing particularly amazing about this game, but it's got a charm that keeps drawing me back to it.  Asteroids style top down 2d space shooter. Collection mechanic, Level up mechanic, resource gathering and shopping mechanics, something of a randomly generated map, but effectively the game doesn't change a lot between plays.  Very satisfying explosions :P
9089	1	a	The hull has been breached and the science is leaking out!
9091	1	a	Arcadey 2D space combat, exploration, ship customization, and zombies? Yes please.
9093	1	a	Amazing game! Very addictive! Definitely worth your money and time!
9095	1	a	It's the best 2 dollars I will ever spend...A MUST HAVE for anyone that likes shooters, space, or LAZERS! Top notch space shooter with rpg styled upgrades. Can't say enough good things about it!  
9097	1	a	Surprisingly much more fun than I had anticipated. The controls need a major revamp, it would do much better as a twin stick shooter, but it's still pretty awesome... Surprised that they made it with Torque, even more surprised at the performance (knowing it was made with torque)
9099	1	a	Awesome top-down space physics combat shooter!
9101	1	a	Fun little top-down space shooter, good for killing some time and blowing some ♥♥♥♥ up!
9103	1	a	Crazy addictive. Once of the best indie games I've played.
9105	1	a	This game has great ship physics and customization. The galaxy is randomly generated and it lets you pick the size / difficulty. If you want a lot of game time out of this game id suggest a harder difficulty. But this is a game you can play through a couple times.
9107	1	a	You get fly around in spaceships like a baws.
9109	1	a	Super fun and addictive, will hold your attention all the way though (provided you like playing upgrade style games). I definitely recommend.
9111	1	a	Very nice space simulation game. Fun to play and easily makes you play for hours.
9113	1	a	Grate game remiding good old times when GTA was something totaly different than it is now and gameplay was about dynamics and plan. The official goal of the game is to reach the center of the glaxy ( dont belive the HYPE !) its all about UPGRADES . Game give's you oportunity to mix with different schematics but after all its DPS that define winner. IF YOU LIKE some oldsQl yet interplanetary gameplay its JUST MENT 2 Have it . Try to think about it as kid of GTA 1 and STARMAGEDDON what can be bad about that ?... 'AND REMEBER UPGRADES ARE EVERYTHING'.
9115	1	a	AFAIR is the first game of its kind I playd. AFAIK it wont be the last.
9117	1	a	I used to love a game called Escape Velocity which is now more or less defunct, but SPAZ has brought back that classic feel and gameplay style of 2D arcade shooter + galaxy exploration in a great way.  Really nice art direction and a couple of extra additions in gameplay mechanic to the old EV style.  I'm not sure what exactly I would change but it would be nice if the ship and abilities upgrade systems were a little different. I think it's a bit overwhelming at first and difficult to make sense of all the different options.  I'm also not a big fan of the mouse mechanic for steering and aiming the ship. While I can appreciate a certain amount of added control, I much prefer a keyboard based rotation mechanism. The static rotation speed combined with the free-motion mouse movement doesn't match up and is difficult to use.
9119	1	a	Great game, Highly Addicting.  Old fashioned 2D arcade feel with a brilliant and humourous storyline.  Also... zombies.
9121	1	a	Nice game!
9123	1	a	SPAZ is a very fun game. Got it with a $2 sale on Steam and at around 180 hrs of play, def a great value. I have played the season versions, and that gives a bit of replay value. Looking forward to SPAZ2 soon. Would reccomend this as a great time dump game.
9125	1	a	The only bad thing about this game is the fact that I discovered it so late. It's brilliant and well worth buying. Can't wait for SPAZ 2 to be released
9127	1	a	Before I knew it, I had played over 93 hours of this game. I'm almost afraid to try playing it again! So obviously I recommend it.
9129	1	a	This game is fun, but procedural generation is (in general) sort of boring. There are lots of systems, to unlock to get to the core but they are all the same. The thing that adds interest is the progression of unlocking new ships and new weapons and you discover and buy them.  Good tip if you are starting: If a faction has things for sale in a certain system, do the quests in that system that make them like you so you can buy it.   Will anyone ever make a game as good as Escape Velocity: Nova? Thats what I want! Seriously if you know of one please send me a message.
9131	1	a	After paying two dollars, I really didn’t expect much, but this game certainly delivered.  I could tell right away a lot of love and care went into making this. What also made this game great was the amount of customization you could put into your ships, from better guns to shield boosters, you could pimp your little cruiser into a true killing machine.   Pros:   Huge amount of customization  Lots of gameplay  no glitches (that I encountered at least)  Vast number of ships to unlock  Very rewarding loot    Cons:   VERY, VERY GRINDY  Lots of repreat quests  game is a little too long   
9133	1	a	I really love this game. It's simple, to the point, and contains a lot of quality mindless classic top down shooter features with strategy game overtones.  I'm looking forward to the sequel to this game and will be happy to pay full price since it was created by two guys that love games.
9135	1	a	Great time waster
9137	1	a	Definitely worth the price. Lots of fun.
9139	1	a	really great space fighting game with a good story
9141	1	a	
9143	1	a	Awesome fun for the price. Looks simple but is has a ton of depth, research trees, custom ship outfitting and upgrading, mining, space pirating. Soon you'll have a small fleet of ships under your command and a huge galaxy to explore, do what you like or follow the story. Loving it!
9145	1	a	Space battles.. realtime mostly. And truly I have no idea why I enjoy this game so much. That and it's dirt cheap for another, oh, 20 minutes :-)
9147	1	a	Good 'Asteroids-like' shooter, but with lots of research, upgrades, and custimization. Can get a little repetative. but lots of fun. Gome goes through a few stages to increase variety.
9149	1	a	This game is one of the most fun heavy grinders out there ... especially on insane difficulty. A perfect game to play in 1-2 hour sittings
9151	1	a	I want to say that it is a simple game with all those elements that anyone should be able to pick out and say 'yeah, that's fun' but that's not the case. This game is great. At times I want to rage-quit and stomp around swearing, and others I want to find the two guys that put this together and shake their hands. Either way they did it right. I haven't found any bugs aside from a spelling error, and things seem to work well for what appears to be a simple game that is in fact possessed of a level of complexety. This game is win.
9153	1	a	The hull has been breached and the science is leaking out!
9155	1	a	Arcadey 2D space combat, exploration, ship customization, and zombies? Yes please.
9157	1	a	You get to explore space, customize and upgrade your fleet, and fight zombies.  Plus, Totalbiscuit is the narator.
9159	1	a	A good open-ended space RPG
9161	1	a	A bit of a grind maybe, but it's fun and unlocking new tech was extremely addictive. The game doesn't require a lot of time at once, but overall I still sunk 40+ hours into it. Coupled with the low price and the fun I had with it it's definitely worth it.
9163	1	a	I've played all 3 Escape Velocity games, if that is what these guys were trying to emulate they failed.  This game is overly complicated from the beginning, it has a difficulty curve like a mountain and has combat that simply doesn't have a good feel to it, which is important as there isn't much more to this game. There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.  This is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents. You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).   It is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet. But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.  This is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial). Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that. Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.  Don't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.
9165	1	a	Excellent game considering the two-man team that made it. Themed well with plenty of RPG action for lewt ♥♥♥♥♥s and shooter action for those Galaga nuts.
9167	1	a	Lots of fun exploring the galaxy, upgrading your ships and of course, fighting off zombies. Decent story. Just a well-made game with no glaring flaws.
9169	1	a	Buy this game
9171	1	a	Score Based  Challenge - A-    Game is intuitive, presents a reasonable difficulty progression, and a excellent learning curve    Starting Tutorial is fun and engaging presenting the necessary information without being boring    Minus a few points for content that wile interesting, where also tedious and overly time consuming.  Game Quality - C    Game is very well designed and provides a fresh and unique feel that sets it apart from other similar games.    Content is fun and varied, supports a large number of play styles and tactics, all retaining use throughout the game    Biggest hit was for low Replayability. after beating the game i just didn’t feel any need to keep playing.  Refinement – A    Played the entire game, start to finish, and never once crashed or encountered a noticeable bug     Balance and effectiveness of ship types and equipment scale well with difficulty (altho some ships never get used due to late availability in the game, making some of the contents use questionable)    Developers seam to take an active role in the games player community (very impressive for only a handfull of people)  Presentation – B    Not a graphics intensive game, however what is included is well themed and well implemented    User interface is intuitive and easy to use    Kind of hokey in an odd sort of way. Story line is a little weak, however still fun and interesting enough    Hype was dead on. This game is exactly what it looks like, exactly as advertised, and well worth the play time.  Additional Content – B+    Game supports all manner of Mods and additional content    Developers have released a small number of fun holiday themed mods for community use    Modding utilities have also been released to general community, they are complete and effective they do however require some investment in time, energy, and learning to use correctly     Relatively active player community, including a functional wiki, and several active modding forums.  Fun – C+    Surprisingly Immersive, despite its rather primitive look, engaging and enjoyable    Intensive enough to keep the players attention, however some aspects did become tedious and frustrating.    Wile not in my top 10. It defiantly has several core quality’s that make it a 'Must Have' for any game collection   Total Grade – Solid 'B+' this is a very good game. A solid experience all the more impressive due to volume of content, and the relatively small development staff. At the time of writing, this the game is priced at $9.99 and it is worth every penny. Will likely get SPAZ 2 when it comes out.
9173	1	a	Awesome top down RPG shooter in a huge galaxy. Now with bounty hunters AND zombies. Go buy!
9175	1	a	Oddly immersive.
9177	1	a	This game was really fun and addictive, I really find myself always coming back to it when I'm in the mood for a space game and put on my muse music
9179	1	a	Spoilers in the title, guys. The third act Zombie reveal would have been better if we werent expecting it, but it did create a creeping sense of dread. Looking forward to future games by these guys.
9181	1	a	It's a quirky top-down space shooter (Dude, retro! Love it!). I hear there will be zombies that seem to be described similarly to Reavers from Firefly. I don't know and I don't care. All I know is I get to blow ♥♥♥♥ up and make weird little ships... which I get the schematics for by blowing up other people and taking their stuff!  Totally worth it. :D
9183	1	a	I was looking for a modern classic-style top-down space exploration game with modifiable ships and asteroid mining but all I could find was a bunch of pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like Dark Orbit. Then I stumbled on SPAZ and honestly it's everything I wanted and more. It's open-world but structured so you don't get overwhelmed by the vastness of space.   I'm very impressed with how refined and balanced the experience is. Everything from upgrades, fighting, and leveling up has had a lot of thought put into it. This does not feel like a 2-person studio production, it plays like a passion project from a very skilled game studio.   I've played 20 hours so far, which is saying something considering most of the games in my library are barely touched regardless of their rating, and can't wait until I have time to play it more.   I'm looking forward to playing more of this game and cannot wait until SPAZ 2!
9185	1	a	Like Asteroids but better, and cheap to boot!
9187	1	a	Wow! Even better than I had thought. This game keeps you going ang going and going and... you get the point.
9189	1	a	Enjoyed the Arcade action with strategic elements! The story was not very good and occasionally it was grindy but overall fun for the price.
9191	1	a	 {LINK REMOVED}  http://goo.gl/0iY7h 
9193	1	a	Crazy addictive. Once of the best indie games I've played.
9195	1	a	I went into a special mission and got ambushed by a UTA Flagship  10/10 would die without saving again
9197	1	a	A game that combines a Asteroid esque type game. Enjoyable and repetitive. Still I can't recommend it enough, its only missing ninjas!
9199	1	a	I thought it was going to be another simple score based space shooter.  I was wrong. It's actually quite the little tactical game. Think gratuitous space battles, but with direct control, and off field support for rebuilding and repair.
9201	1	a	Don't people have enough of these long long reviews for simple games? A good and enjoyable game, recomending that you should play this. You will love it, also keep your heads up for SPAZ 2. Looks very good even better so than SPAZ 1.
9203	1	a	Definitely unique, the art is nothing to write home about but blasting through blockade after blockade is fun. For the first handful of times anyway. There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.  It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.  If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.
9205	1	a	Great game if you like top-down space combat and squad tactics. Also, space zombies.
9207	1	a	if you know me you know i play games constantly until i beat them this game is Great, if you played the demo and liked it, i reccommend you buy it 205 hours of game time, and i've beaten it twice
9209	1	a	This game is excellent. Fun, snappy, full of wit and really addictive combat. I could not recommend this enough.
9211	1	a	Astoundingly good, and an absolute steal with the price point.  Screenshots and videos do not do this game justice - it is far far more than just arcadey space shooting. If you're looking for an indie game, I'd choose this one.
9213	1	a	Verry good example of awsome indie game developed only by tow persons... GOOD JOB :)
9215	1	a	Play this bloody game, it's awesome!
9217	1	a	Scratch the surface and it soon becomes deeper than a rather deep hole.  Much pleasure to be had shooting escape pods and watching the lil sods writhe in agony as their atmosphere vents exposing them to the vacuum. Or forcing them aboard only to vent them from the airlock anyway-!  That'll teach you for shooting at me with yer frikkin lasers.   Shoot &gt; Research &gt; Resource &gt; Equip &gt; Shoot like a badass &gt; Research Badass Gear &gt; You see where this is going.  Simple yet satisfying.  9.2 / 10
9219	1	a	(edit- after finishing it) Brilliant space combat game made by two people. A balance between action and strategy, leaning a bit on the action side. Collect resources, crew, research data, blueprints for tech, and different ship hulls. My main critisisms are lack of variety in missions and crazy difficulty spikes in the last chapter. Best game I've played on steam in a long time, give the demo a shot!
9221	1	a	I never played this game and it still says I can write a review! 11/10
9223	1	a	Great Space game. Addicting! DL the demo and try it out!
9225	1	a	Four words: space pirates and zombies. Enough said. Or maybe not quite enough said. This game is more fun than you can ever imagine.
9227	1	a	After following the development of this game for a while I am pleased to say that the wait was worth it. As with games like Terraria and Super Meat Boy, do not be fooled by the simplified graphics as it more than makes up for them in playability and addictive content.  The game universe is HUGE, hundreds of star systems each with multiple planets for you to explore. Each planet within a system offers missions or events for you to encounter. As you complete one mission another is generated as the universe evolves with every action you take.  On release there are over 30 ships for you to obtain and dozens of technologies to research. In order to advance the available technologies or ship designs you will have to blast your way through the galaxy and salvage the blueprints and data you need.  The only criticism I would make is that there is no multiplay feature but the developers are continually adding content to the game and hopefully they integrate multiplayer mode(s) in the future.
9229	1	a	A surprisingly deep space opera, considering it's price tag. Travel to the galactic core in search of riches, building ships and researching technology along the way. 2D combat is fun, you can tweek your ships depending on component designs you bought or pillaged and the game gives you quite a bit of choice on how you reach your goals. Kept me engaged to the end.
9231	1	a	Four words: space pirates and zombies. Enough said. Or maybe not quite enough said. This game is more fun than you can ever imagine.
9233	1	a	Awesome game, tons of depth, reminds me of Star Control but without messy strategy getting in the way.

9237	1	a	All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.
9239	1	a	I purchased SPAZ on a whim; it's not the type of game I usually play but, more importantly, it's not the sort of game I actively avoid either.  To get the criticisms out of the way first, SPAZ has a fairly steep and unforgiving learning curve. Attempting to quickly punch through warp gates and advance the story will end in complete destruction. Lengthy and repetitive grinding sessions are required in order to keep your tech levels high enough to survive.  That said, SPAZ is insanely addictive, fun and the payoffs are worth it. What could be better than more, bigger and better ships?  ... and that's even before the zombies come into play.  I definitely can't wait for SPAZ 2.
9241	1	a	What do you get if you cross an arcade shooter with an RPG, and then add in a turn-based strategy zombie apocalypse scenario for the end game?  Yeah, this is what you get. And it's a really awesome indie game.
9243	1	a	Pirate and Zombies in space, need anything else ? Plus Totalbiscuit voice acting. Neat little indy game.
9245	1	a	After I understood the game (controls/menu/what am I doing?) I've got to say: One of the best indie games I've played so far. The soundeffects are a bit lowfi, but it has modding ablities, so maybe theres a way to replace them. Doesn't really affect the overall manifique experience
9247	1	a	Has the feel of the old Star Control games... Good little story, alot of fun to spec your ships, and an awesome combat system! I've had sense BETA and I still play it!
9249	1	a	Zombies and Pirates in space blowing eachother to pieces.. how is any part of that not badass?
9251	1	a	it's cheap now :D 2 euros =]
9253	1	a	Imagine Stellar Frontier with better graphics, the ability to move to a new solar system once you've wiped out everybody then add big frakkin' guns and lots of 'splosions!  It's pirates and zombies in space! All it needs is ninjas and this game would be perfect! (I hear that's coming in an update...)
9255	1	a	Solid but basic game. Starts out fun and stays fun, although it can get tedious if played for too long at a time. The gameplay doesn't suit long sessions very well. The story is likewise basic but serves the game quite well.
9257	1	a	An excellent top down space based game, it's a pretty unique experience with some rpg like progression elements. Definitely worth playing.
9259	1	a	This is an excellent game. I totally recomend it.
9261	1	a	i've played through this game twice, one normally and a second when i discoverd this game had a farily active modding community and loved every bit of them, 8.5/10.
9263	1	a	It's a pretty little top-down space shoot-em-up in a randomly generated size-adjustable galaxy (so there's replay value). I like to dive in now and then and advance a few levels. One unusual item is a list of 'coming soon' features on the menu screen. The 'and bounty hunters' bit is definitely new since I last played, and I seem to see a few new ship blueprints, so obviously they are hard at work adding DLC. Can't go far wrong with this one if you like old style space shooters.
9265	1	a	A top-down shmup with customiseable ships, RPG elements related to tech, randomised galaxies, and missions... Really. What's there not to like? Has some nice splashes of humor, too. Very beautiful and rather addictive and the controls are simple and elegant. I hope the expansions continue, 'cuz I can't get enough of this game.
9267	1	a	very fun, and some of the mods acctually work.
9269	1	a	Arcade style gameplay that is fun and worth the price of admission. Rating 7.5/10
9271	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. in a nut shell, it's a 2d top down space shooter rpg. I STRONGLY recommend at least trying the FREE demo.
9273	1	a	As you can see i played this game quite a bit. i played the demo before anything too. so when i say this game was just a stepping stone for what is to come in SPAZ 2 the you best belive me. yes this game had its flaws at time i can rember refusing to play because i had put myself in a stupid situation i couldnt do anything in. however im writing this maily becasue im hard for SPAZ 2 and waiting while your eger sucks.  BASICALLY MY MESSAGE IS SPAZ IS AWESOME!!!!  and i have high hopes for SPAZ 2
9275	1	a	I liked it enough to put 30 something hours into it. Try it you nerd.
9277	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time!
9279	1	a	Affordable replayability.   Explore the randomly generated galaxies in this shooter/rpg as you also explore build options and upgrades.
9281	1	a	A neat little space arena that brings back distant memories of Subspace. Probably worth buying only because there's virtually no competition in the genre. It can be frustrating not being able to zoom out more when you're being shot off-screen, and the drawn graphics such as pilot avatars and Civ relations come off as very sloppy when I think they were going for charming.   The main story gets monotonous because you don't choose to grind if you want better tech, you HAVE to grind for better tech. But the gameplay does get a breath of fresh air when you start to battle zombies and build up your uninfected armada. But the real draw is the core gameplay of top-down, space dog-fighting. Taking out an enemy ship on your own is very rewarding and subsequently, being killed will have you cursing under your breath.   If you're a masochist like me, there's worse ways to spend three bucks. Plus, it's easy to tell that the devs could do a lot with a little more funding.   
9283	1	a	This game is a ridiculous grind and nothing more. The first hour tutorial and background story is annoying.  The only way to enjoy this game is by using the easiest settings and getting high.  you're gonna be doing the same thing over and over again for 60+ hours anyway.
9285	1	a	Great game. So worth the asking price. I like that there are alot of options on how you can play. Only note to the DEVS is to hurry and make the second one.
9287	1	a	Who would have thought a game so simple could be so addictive!
9289	1	a	A fun top down shooter with depth and fun gameplay.
9291	1	a	Classic is back with this one. If you love open space games like free-lancer etc. This one is for you!
9293	1	a	Hey so this game is pretty awesome. It has a real nice mix of top down arcade action with really simple controls and a deep RPGesque mechanic with tons of items that you can pick up and use (e.g. armor, weapons, drones, ship systems). This game is definitely worth the money.
9295	1	a	This game is very time consuming, but actually pretty good at the same time. Bad combination.
9297	1	a	worth the price
9299	1	a	Best game ever. Great 2D space action sim with RPG elements. Buy it!
9301	1	a	Loved Stard Control II? You will crave for SPAZ!
9303	1	a	Strangely compelling once you get into it
9305	1	a	A really addictive spave RPG, A++
9307	1	a	Awesome top-down space physics combat shooter!
9309	1	a	Really simple and really addictive gameplay. You aren't going to get lost in the mechanics of it, the controls are easy but again, super addictive!
9311	1	a	The other day I scavenging a ship out in the old mine field, when I noticed that there was ♥♥♥♥ growin' all over the walls. Needless to say I got in my ship, and got the hell outta there.  12/10 - Best game in a few years imho
9313	1	a	Surprisingly addictive and fun space action/rpg/ship game,
9315	1	a	It's a decent action-RPG 2d space shooter type thing, let down a bit by repitiveness, grinding as you get later into it, having up to 3 ships at once but 2 of them are inconsiquencially small and the AI controling them isn't great. Still fun and got a sizable update a while ago I still have't checked out.
9317	1	a	WoW! Just simply wow! One of the best games i ever played! Pros -Alot of ships -Alot of equipment(Armor,specialists,weapons etc.) -Customizate you ships and fleets -Hours and Hours(even years) of enjoyable FUN -Never gets boring Cons -There are no
9319	1	a	It's like space pokémon. Not in the way of being space pokémon, but as in you have to be a bit OCD and enjoy grinding. Definitely has its wobble-wobble-click moments, though, but if you have bad luck they can be few and far between. The strategy is actually pretty deep once you get used to hammering the space bar and pointing ships places and holding onto your precious goons. I have played this game for 36 hours, apparently, and I haven't even reached the zombie level, so it's pretty long, or I'm pretty terrible. If you're a bit CDO (hahahaha), and enjoy min-maxing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the pigs, I'd completely reccomend it.
9321	1	a	awsome game
9323	1	a	The dialog is complete rubbish but eh game play is quite addictive.
9325	1	a	A lot of fun for such a low price. A bang for your buck if there ever was one.
9327	1	a	Tried this on the Free-Weekend-Thing. After two hours into the game I can say that it is worth 2 Bucks.  + easy too navigate and organise your fleet + lots of ships and stuff to upgrade + decent amount of tactical stuff to concider + good interface + non hectic, more or less relaxing gameplay  - repetitiv - boring 'story' (havent seen any zombies yet, maybe there will be smth like a story?) - the npcs all have pretty ugly faces  But yeah, if you see this game for sale grab it. The Metascore of 73 or what it is is pretty accurate. It is not a bad game!
9329	1	a	Best 10 bucks I ever spent, highly reccomend trying the demo. You'll be hooked.
9331	1	a	Hey guys. Check out Space Pirates and Zombies. I got it cheap a long time ago and dismissed it originally. The game is actually a blast. Think Asterioids on steroids mixed with Space Run, and a hint of FTL.
9333	1	a	I'm not the type with time or patience for complicated games, however this game is not too simple that it's boring, and too complicated that it's tedious, it stoke a perfect balance for me. This game has an old school feel, I get a nice nostalgia feeling playing it, it's my favorite game at the moment.  We need more games like it, gameplay &gt; gfx ANYTIME !
9335	1	a	A excellent space exploration game with some awesome space battles. Extremely addictive and fun, the battles just get bigger and better not to mention creating your own fleet as you progress.  Well spent $15. This game could be worth double and I'd gladly buy it.
9337	1	a	There are some games that are like reading great book on roller caster with jet fighting around you and explosions beneath you, games that after you finish them you just have one thought: WOW!  SPAZ is not one of these games. Spaz is like couch, good TV, beer and some relaxing film. There is nothing new, nothing special, very often same situation over and over and still when you are at work you think about that couch. When you sit at this couch and your friends calling you just don't want to leave.   SPAZ is great space shooter/aka RTS/tactic/brainless forward, backward, shoot that as****e, re-spawn, forward, backward... With few types of missions and some plot. Nothing special really. But SPAZ does have this one thing that a lot of games miss, that weird, invisible thing that makes you want to play this game again, and again, and again. And when you have enough, you just leave it there to find out that week later you want to play it again.   Is it worth 10 euros? Hmm, knowing what I know now, it's rather yes. Is it worth 5 euros? Hell yeah! So it's your choice my friend, will you sit on the couch and start a next good, lazy day?
9339	1	a	yes..good game! old school with upto date grapthics. its needs more weopons tho and the ability to paint your ships so you could wreck face with style
9341	1	a	This is ownage
9343	1	a	I have been a fan of the Escape Velocity series on the old Macintosh computers, back when I was stuck on a Mac with barely any games. Escape Velocity by Ambrosia Software was one of the few games that were actually GOOD on the Mac, and I enjoyed the series a lot.   SPAZ is very similar in terms of controls, and the 2D space combat action, but more combat-centric than that of the Escape Velocity series. Auto-building your destroyed ships, simple ship outfit customizability, infinite missiles (if equipped with missile launchers), etc. are some aspects that cuts out the micro-management, and more PEW PEW, BOOM!  Even if you aren't familiar with Escape Velocity, it is a fun game that is fairly easy to get into. With randomly generated galaxies upon save creation, and difficulty settings, it provides some pretty good replay value as well, being able to test out different strategies along the way. If you enjoy space combat action, SPAZ is a great game for some big explosions.
9345	1	a	Space battles.. realtime mostly. And truly I have no idea why I enjoy this game so much. That and it's dirt cheap for another, oh, 20 minutes :-)
9347	1	a	One of the best top down shooters in the space genre that I have played. Every weapon is affected by physics and the gameplay is just amazing. They have so far sent out tons of free DLC and one free expansion and they aren't planning on stopping now.  I highly recommend buying this game both to support Indie developers (who create the games of their dreams &amp; share it to all of us) and to support the game itself future SPAZ 2.
9349	1	a	Not close enough to Escape Velocity Nova, but still pretty good.
9351	1	a	This was going to be just a game I decided to get that was cheap and could kill time. Turns out I got really tangled into the cool storyline of the game and more than likely had no hope of hating it as combines Space, Pirates, And Zombies!  The graphics seem simple but there's a lot more detail than I expected and the backgrounds to the levels are designed beautifully. Probably somethings you might be able to see in space with the right filters.  Gameplay can become a bit repetative though. It mostly consists of moving to the next planet, destroying an enemy and possibly mine an asteroid. Buy some parts and upgrade your ship.  Still, I've already put a couple of hours into this game and I don't intend to put it down anytime soon.
9353	1	a	Its so fun, dropped many fun hours into it. Hiughly recommend, there should be more of these games.
9355	1	a	Fun, very open universe. Gives you a lot of freedom to explore, destoy, and build.
9357	1	a	♥♥♥♥ I MEAN THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING YOU EVER NEED IN A GAME. HERES A VERY LENGTHY LIST FOLLOWED BY CHECKMARKS IF THE GAME HAS IT:  1. SPACE [✓] 2. PIRATES [✓] 3. AND(s) [✓] 4. ZOMBIES [✓]  THAT RIGHT THERE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. WHY ARE YOU EVEN STILL READING THIS? YOU SHOULD BE IN SPACE BEHAVING LIKE A PIRATE IN ORDER TO KILL ZOMBIES AND ANDS!
9359	1	a	Played it enough, better be good :-)
9361	1	a	very fun, and some of the mods acctually work.
9363	1	a	The dev said they didnt see any games of the kind and did it thenselves and did it GOOD , its not repetitive as some may describe (like a shooting game you have to shoot and that doesnt make it repetitive) has a very good storyline and playability is awesome , you have to kill a ship to use it or at late game it come by killing some other high level zombie. you get what u fight for and survive to harvest and atack!!!
9365	1	a	A top-down shmup with customiseable ships, RPG elements related to tech, randomised galaxies, and missions... Really. What's there not to like? Has some nice splashes of humor, too. Very beautiful and rather addictive and the controls are simple and elegant. I hope the expansions continue, 'cuz I can't get enough of this game.
9367	1	a	My only suggestion is to play it on normal difficulty or easier, as the harder difficulties compound the problem with this game stretching into the bad end of the repetition scale. Still, with a host of ships to build and customize with many different attachments, it's fun to simply try out new combinations and strategies. The AI is competent enough, though exploitable (and your AI controlled ships are sometimes similarly stupid). This actually works in the games favor, however, IMO. Overall, the controls work great, there's lot's of customizability and skill that goes into your victories and defeats, and this game was made by 2 guys. I want to see what they can do next, personally, so I'd like to see them make some money to do so.
9369	1	a	Fun, very open universe. Gives you a lot of freedom to explore, destoy, and build.
9371	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! if you love space this is the game for you.
9373	1	a	Its an ok game. i downlaoded it when it was free to play one weekend. probaly one of the less expensive 'Simulator' games out there. its fun of you have nothing else to do
9375	1	a	there are things that arent space pirates or zombies in this game but thats ok  space pirates and zombies 2 looks p cool heres a link   
9377	1	a	All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.
9379	1	a	A game that is poorly named and very well put together for being done by a 2-man team.
9381	1	a	This is one of the best space games I have ever reviewed. O cons. Some people might not like it because of the 2D, but being able to buy new space weapons, construct new ships and beating up zombies just pays it off.
9383	1	a	Amazing game. I've put 45 hours into it and i'm not sure if i'm even halfway through!
9385	1	a	Not many games like this these days.
9387	1	a	Before I knew it, I had played over 93 hours of this game. I'm almost afraid to try playing it again! So obviously I recommend it.
9389	1	a	Goofy name, amazing game.  Keeping it short this game is amazing if you're into customizable ships, strategic real time combat, and an open world to travel and explore as you see fit but with a storyline and a specific overall goal. In many ways it's kind of like a real time Space Rangers.   And it has a ton of replayability. There are a wide array of skills that dramatically increase the effectiveness of certain mutually exclusive parts (like a shield or a cloaking device) and also allow access to interesting and unique versions of said item. So for instance you might play through one game using cloaks and missiles, whereas another game you might not use a cloak or a shield and instead rely on armor, hull and improving the capability of your crew to repair damage while you're taking it. Options, options, options. All quite well balanced and viable, even if some are 'more viable' than others. 
9391	1	a	The combat and progression is very fun. Also the graphics are pleasant and the story is absurd, in a good kind of way
9393	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. Can't wait for the sequel. Very addictive.
9395	1	a	there is somthing about this game that is almost zen like, i tend to play in quick bursts or sink over 2 hours at a time into it  i would say you should get it and keep an eye out for the second game coming out soon(ish)
9397	1	a	This is a amazing game. I love it. The story line is just pure bliss.... can't wait for the second game of it.   Buy this game if you love to comit to games, love single player, and love huge fleets of destruction in space. Oh and zombies. :D  It took me 64 hours to complete the game, and thats just sticking with the story and not doing any of the secondary option, and there are TONS.  Over 2 years, I finished it. gg
9399	1	a	Best top-down game since GTA2. Can't wait for the sequel. 10/10 That GOTY 2011 award is legit
9401	1	a	My only issues were...  Pacing: It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours. Also if you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them. And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use. Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.  Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game. I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.
9403	1	a	Nice concept and execution! I like it!
9405	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.  You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.  The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.  Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.  The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.  The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.  The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.  Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.  In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.  Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.  This game simply rocks and you have to try it.
9407	1	a	I logged over a hundred hours on this puppy! It is a LOT of fun. Five cents an hour for great fun? Can't beat it.
9409	1	a	This game is excellent. Fun, snappy, full of wit and really addictive combat. I could not recommend this enough.
9411	1	a	Top-down gun-toting ship-building space-combat action! Simple and addictive.
9413	1	a	do u even zombies bro well this game does spaz is a game about space exploration the first thing you want to do is take off and explore but dont go too fast or youll get blown up by a much larger ship XD i dont want to spoil too much but the blank blank is a zombie spy'ish gather recoucers make ships get them blown up make more i just have one more thing to say BUY THIS GAME FOR CRYING OUT LOUD JUST BY. ps blank blank is a spy (-i-) d (U)
9415	1	a	Game rocks! I bought it for 2 bucks and put 50 hours in it. I love the different ships you can aquire and there's so many builds and ways to play! The is a blast to play and the controls are great. It's a really arcade-y feeling game but there's so much depths and upgrades to get (and the upgrades aren't just linear ones).
9417	1	a	it was pretty cool but they could have put a tiny bit bigger effort.................
9419	1	a	This game is incredibly addictive, don't let its semi-lame name confuse you!
9421	1	a	Space battles.. realtime mostly. And truly I have no idea why I enjoy this game so much. That and it's dirt cheap for another, oh, 20 minutes :-)
9423	1	a	This is very nice This is a complementary review.  The difficulty settings are thouroughly thought. Any complaint about difficulty, rebuilding, etc.  Is the player's fault. The difficulty settings, and map/campaign customs at the begining are directly related to adapt the game to you. if your a massive noob, choose the according settings!  This is a complementary review.
9425	1	a	Arcade style combat with RPG elements. Ship armaments, different ship styles, massive map, questing, factions. Has a lot for $5. Good ambient radio communication... this is important for some people? Seems to have a fair number of little surprises.
9427	1	a	I was blown away by how awesome this game is! It piqued my interest because it looked vaguely similar to a game I used to play in my younger years (Inner Space, look it up!) but I was not prepared for the awesomeness contained within. This game is my new addiction, I can't get enough of it! The upgrade system is stellar, the different ships and upgrades are varied and lend to an amazing assortment of strategies, suited for multiple play styles. The reputation system within each system independant of each other means you can have fun and not screw up what you were doing in another place. I just love it. I can't wait for #2 now!
9429	1	a	The dialog is complete rubbish but eh game play is quite addictive.
9431	1	a	@Skipp This one! It's really fun! 
9433	1	a	For a two-dimensional space shooter, this game has a lot to offer. It makes me think of what EVE Online might have been if it had been concieved as a single-player game back in 1995 or so. It excells as a casual stress reliever and is pretty much guaranteed to keep a player engaged in short bursts for a good time. However, the set pieces begin to repeat themselves after a while- after all, it is still a work in progress- (In the same manner that Team Fortress 2 is a work in progress.) but a damned good one at that.
9435	1	a	Crazy addictive. Once of the best indie games I've played.
9437	1	a	Best top-down RPG arcade space shooter around.
9439	1	a	I used to love a game called Escape Velocity which is now more or less defunct, but SPAZ has brought back that classic feel and gameplay style of 2D arcade shooter + galaxy exploration in a great way.  Really nice art direction and a couple of extra additions in gameplay mechanic to the old EV style.  I'm not sure what exactly I would change but it would be nice if the ship and abilities upgrade systems were a little different. I think it's a bit overwhelming at first and difficult to make sense of all the different options.  I'm also not a big fan of the mouse mechanic for steering and aiming the ship. While I can appreciate a certain amount of added control, I much prefer a keyboard based rotation mechanism. The static rotation speed combined with the free-motion mouse movement doesn't match up and is difficult to use.
9441	1	a	My Let's Play of SPAZ:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Pap9speyQl6P2FM1yy3WnPAY62gkrkS   This game is very fun and challenging, but I do feel the enemy runs away WAY TOO MUCH, most of this game is spent chasing enemies as they run away... it can be mighty annoying...  7.5/10
9443	1	a	Fun and addictive a good time sink.
9445	1	a	Why don't you already own this? Get it now!
9447	1	a	A decent Space RPG game, who I wish there where more ships and a longer story :( Worth the price.
9449	1	a	It's quite the fun game, roaming around the galaxy and shooting stuff (tm). After about 15h of gameplay at about lvl 35, it gets a bit repetitive tho. Advances of your own equipment have slowed down considerably, while the opponents get stronger and stronger. Good there is also a story line to keep you going. Gonna pick up playing again at some later stage, thumbs up so far.
9451	1	a	I've played all 3 Escape Velocity games, if that is what these guys were trying to emulate they failed.  This game is overly complicated from the beginning, it has a difficulty curve like a mountain and has combat that simply doesn't have a good feel to it, which is important as there isn't much more to this game. There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.  This is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents. You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).   It is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet. But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.  This is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial). Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that. Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.  Don't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.
9453	1	a	took me a long time to get tired of playen this game. if u dont mind a bit of plot in the sandbox feel then yea float around a bit here
9455	1	a	The game is hands down one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years, easily in my top 5 indie games when you consider it's 'fun factor'. The graphics are very pleasing especially for a cartoon look. The sound fit's the game well as does the artwork. SPAZ has several difficulty settings ranging from 'casual just play for fun and never lose' to 'please just kill me now'. On it's most difficult setting even the most experienced gamers will be tested. The galaxy can be created relatively small (still very large offering many hours of gameplay) to massive offering literally hundreds of hours of play time. The map is also randomly generated so replay value is high. Bounty Hunters (free DLC) adds a fourth faction to interact with adding new ways to explore or destroy star systems!  All in all a highly suggested purchase that will offer something to all gamers, casual and hardcore alike.
9457	1	a	Space. Pirates. Zombies. Can't go wrong with this one.
9459	1	a	It's a really good game! A little repetitive if you want to get everything, but that's true in many games.
9461	1	a	This was a pleasant surprise of a space sim, in which the focus is as much on the 2D top-down space combat as it is on resource collection, faction negotiation/manipulation, and technology collection. It has a very RPG feel - as you gain experience and level, you place points into the systems of your ship that you most rely on, forcing you to always evaluate your strategy as there are MANY different systems to put points into, and the ships that you receive all use them differently.   I did not expect to get sucked into this game, nor did I expect it to last as long as it did. Be careful with this one - it can get addictive very quickly. And once you get going, it's going to carry you a lot longer than you'll expect. It does get too repetitive towards the end of the game, and a lot of that time was spent grinding out materials.   3 out of 5 foxes.
9463	1	a	This game is a rare indy gem, unlike most indie gems, this game has more gameplay in it than most games released these days. The story is laughable and hard to follow, something about upgrading your mothership and getting a laser or something, but it does take a pretty unexpected twist in the fourth act.   The meat of the game is VERY customizable ship combat. Outfit your increasingly powerful ships with lasers, cannons, missles, fighter drones, and more. The combat is great too, the Shield/Hull defences vs. Lasers/Projectiles mechanic requires carefull weapon loadouts, and as long as you keep your less than stellar AI comrades under a good leash, even overwhelming odds can be handled with skill.   Also, SPAZ is made by a two-man team who are just doing what they love, and buying this game helps them make the game better. SPAZ has added HUGE amounts of content since launch (Namely the Bounty Hunters) and will keep having content added if people keep supporting it.
9465	1	a	I really enjoy this game.
9467	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
9469	1	a	On the surface, this may just look like Asteroids 2011. And yes, the 2D space battles are awesome and the control mechanics are good once you're used to them. But it's also part RPG: your ships as your characters, complete with loadouts, unlocks, and even skills via your tech research. And part RTS, via a rudimentary tactical screen where you can control your forces mid-battle. You unlock new ships by destroying someone else's model - even your allies' - and scouring the wreckage; piracy comes naturally in the game. Cuz hey... that's a beautiful new ship your 'valued comrade' just brought to battle. It'd be a shame if anything happened to it...
9471	1	a	Still one of the best indies that I ever bought. End-game could have been better though.
9473	1	a	This is a excellent action space rpg. Multiple technology trees, tons of different ships, in a very easy to use package. I'm 10+ hours in and have only scratched the surface.
9475	1	a	more fun than it is supposed to be. addictive like hell !
9477	1	a	Apart from extremely long start of game loading time, SPAZ is overall a fun top-down 4X game. Customisation is cool, but also feels like once you die (and if you keep dying) you'll be reset back to square one. Forcing you to mine for very small mineral patches and do low level jobs just to get enough to build you crazy expensive ships. Cheap game, so value for money - 6/10
9479	1	a	This is a pretty good game for old school fans of games like Escape Velocity. Unfortunately the game doesn't do a very good job at immersing you like some of those older games do. The universe feels pretty shallow, and some of the tackier interface and portrait artwork can break immersion. Although many aspects are quite antiquated, the combat system is its redeaming factor, and is the primary focus of the game. I would suggest starting with a smaller sized galaxy since progressing through the game's story can drag on a bit and require more grinding otherwise.
9481	1	a	This is a great 2D game. You need to get past the fact that it is 2D. This game is highly reccomended to those people that played Star Sonata or those gamers out there that like top down games. I have had a lot of fun with it.
9483	1	a	This game is fun. You like fun.
9485	1	a	30 Hours of pure fun, probably the best indie game ive ever played.
9487	1	a	Fun game, good RPG, with some funny bits. played 40ish hours.
9489	1	a	Like Space Games (check), Like free flowing story games (check)  then why not check out SPAZ, it's a 2d take on the older elite and frontier games and it doesn't disapoint, with many ways to customise you own fleet of little space ships and tailor there weapon systems and defense to your play style  and for the price this game is a bargin, so fancy a trip to the center of the universe in search of treasure and fame,  then buy SPAZ
9491	1	a	Great game and doesn't require amazing specs to play.
9493	1	a	Such a fun game with a unique idea. And space, who doesn't love space.
9495	1	a	Yeah, it's allright I guess. It's not fantastic. It fills some time. I wish there were more factions. I wish the ship upgrades felt more special, like I had really worked my tail to get them instead of just being friends with some guys on a space station. I guess that would be helped by more factions really.
9497	1	a	Customizable spaceships, outright piracy and mass destruction - with late-game zombies. It is quite entertaining and fun.  It is as challenging as you are willing to grind up - the longer you spend grinding the easier the game gets, the quicker you rush missions the easier it becomes to be outmached. Its quite a fun take on it all in a 2D top-down shooter.  There is any number of ways to build and play, taking a wide variety of options to the gamem but it does ultimetly boil down to a gindfest, but still an enjoyable one.  This definetly is one I'd reccomend.
9499	1	a	So. Much. Fun. This is classic space shooter/rpg, done really well. Takes a bit of time to ramp up, but you'll eventually find yourself commanding a fleet of ships doing battle with zombie-infested cruisers. If you've ever played Escape Velocity - this is the game for you.
9501	1	a	Great little game, soaks up more time than you'd expect.
9503	1	a	It was a time suck great game!
9505	1	a	It's an ok game if you like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RPGs and ♥♥♥♥
9507	1	a	I was a bit aprehensive and couldn't decide weather to buy SPAZ or not .I left that idea for couple of weeks and I came back to it just yesterday. Well...I have already spent over 15h of playing SPAZ and I got to tell you : the game is well worth the money ,it is not one dimentional space game as I previously thought. It is rich and deep ! You do missions and level up your ships and hangar .You collect blueprints from wreckage's and research and manufacture new components or entire  ships. You can hire a specialists and train them to be more efficient as your crew. Dock to the station buy new gear there ,choose which faction you wanna be friends with and which you wanna be seen as foe .But beware there is also a group of bounty hunters that on some stage of plaing SPAZ will start following your tracks. Travel throu spacious Universe from one solar system to another ,break through  enemies gate ,develop your skills and use those ,mine Rez to get rich ,and many ,many more option in SPAZ are waiting for you. Do not hesitate ! :)
9509	1	a	Ever enjoyed Star Control 2? Space Rangers 2? Well then here is SPAZ. Created by a group disappointed by the lack of such games on the market today.  For a game that only cost $15, and succesfully pulled me away from Deus Ex: Human Revolution - get it!
9511	1	a	Top down space shooter with RPG elements... and ZOMBIES!!!  Lots of fun, can be hard as hell sometimes
9513	1	a	Good game. Old school space strategy/action.
9515	1	a	Just showing my support for 2 indie developers who put together a fun casual game. I haven't played it ong but see the potential for long-term play, or when in the diet coke and pretzel mood. That it's a space-themed game that doesn't take itself too seriously is a plus.
9517	1	a	This is a highly addictive game and certainly original. Why is it only indie developers can make decent games these days while corporations like EA Games and Activision simply recycle all their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t into some half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at a pathetic game?  Case and point: Command &amp; Conquer 4, and Modern Warfare 2/3 whatever.
9519	1	a	Really fun game, although it does not look appealing at first, it is a really good game, if you are into these kind of games that is.
9521	1	a	Without a doubt, a very fun game that clicks all the right boxes. You can pick up and play at any time, but be careful because you will get drawn into the game, and before you know it 4 hours have passed
9523	1	a	Fun, simple gameplay. Manage a small fleet of ships and save the galaxy from zombies.
9525	1	a	Great game if you like:  Space combat Zombies Exploration 15-20 Hours of game play
9527	1	a	Such an amazing game! Great single player. Lots of stuff to unlock. Only wish it had multiplayer. Regardless, still an amazing game to spend lots of time into
9529	1	a	Awesome oldschool feel with newschool mechanics. Im hooked!
9531	1	a	Get wiped out entirley and spend 30 mins farming asteroids before you can attack again. 10/10.
9533	1	a	suprisingly good game
9535	1	a	Highly recommend this game for those who are armchair space fleet commanders. Its a small footprint, big impact game that keeps feeding you awesome in its own way.
9537	1	a	It's very fun and addicting I might say. Even though it's quite repetitive, it makes you want to level up and explore every inch of the game. If you're underleveled in this game it really put you on a difficult spot to win. But that's also a challenge on its own so to me its a win win. There's also a lot of way you can go through galaxies. Stealth tech/Bombs/Turrets.. A LOT OF WAYS!!! That's the fun of it. For now I only use brute strength and upgrade engines and weapon upgrades but little do I know that other give me such a big advantage as well. If you're the kind of person like progression this would be it. Not to mention you can make other ships by reverse engineered the ones that you destroyed. Pretty cool system huh?? No longer you need to feel frustrated over a ship that's better than you.   Overall I would give this game 8/10, It's there but after a while it would get a bit of grinding spree since the ships that you fought sometimes overpowered you by a mile. (AND THOSE DAMNED BOUNTY HUNTERS!! GRAHHHHHH I HATE THEM SO MUCH!! YET THEY GIVE SO MUCH REWARDS!!)
9539	1	a	It is rare to see this tyoe of game but I welcome it. Very fun to play. I just wish there where more like it.
9541	1	a	Fun for the right price. more content and ships make this more fun.
9543	1	a	Right off the bat. This game is a joy to play; I could definitely tell that this game was made from someones passion for classic space RPG. It combines mechanics from classic arcade games with modern graphics and a sprinkle of Atom Zombie Smasher; not to mention a standard RPG leveling up system; making a very user friendly, casual and a heck load of fun to play. With a variety of ships to unlock fallowed by weapons and other unique upgrades also customisable ships ; you will be burning through hours and hours of gameplay. However like most RPG games, quests does get repetitive after a period of time such as killing or collecting X,Y and Z etc and not to mention pretty mediocre voice acting. On the contrary, with new updates underway to expand the game, this is sure worth the money. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves classic space RPG or have good taste for games in general :)
9545	1	a	This game is one of the best space games i've ever played. Even though it's a 2D, i find it much better than most space action games i played, even the X series. The dozen hours i spent on this game were all worth it. I recommend this game to anyone that like space action games.
9547	1	a	Get this game.
9549	1	a	Addictive and easily moddable  7.6/10
9551	1	a	This game is way too much addictive, play with a clock beside you!
9553	1	a	Fear the laserboat of doom
9555	1	a	Fantastic space sim-ish game. Skill based ship combat and open world.
9557	1	a	Great Space game. Addicting! DL the demo and try it out!
9559	1	a	You just dont find good games at a good price like this one. This game is 10 levels of EPIC GRAVY!!
9561	1	a	Its so fun, dropped many fun hours into it. Hiughly recommend, there should be more of these games.
9563	1	a	All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.
9565	1	a	Great space combat game. If you like customizing your ship, gathering resources, and making big explosions, you should check this game out.
9567	1	a	I actually had a ton of fun playing this game, pretty simple to learn but there were some tough scenarios
9569	1	a	It may seem like an innocuous game at first but believe me it is highly addictive. I have already spent hours and hours playing it. Would highly recommend it.
9571	1	a	space exploration and combat game with cute graphics and which doesnt take itself too seriously. A breath of retro gaming without hard core difficulty (although that is available too). And when on sale like today, well...GRAB
9573	1	a	great job to the developers. if you like a little bit of action, a little bit of harvesting, space travel, upgrading ships and weapons systems, trading with random encounters in space, and a well thought-out game with nice visuals, this is for you. the price is very fair for what you get and i would recommend it to anybody wanting some casual and progressive space fun. havent gotten to the zombies yet though :) definitely recommended
9575	1	a	Nice little game, a little toi much grinding but ok
9577	1	a	An updated Star Control for today's gamer. Well worth the money!
9579	1	a	Start with a tiny space ship. Kill some other tiny space ships. Kill a big space ship. Build a big space ship. Keep making space ship bigger until all space ships are smaller than you. You are king spaceship.   The zombies bit is mids, though.
9581	1	a	A nice blend of arcade and strategy with loads of stuff to discover. Also it reminds Spore with Galaxy Map and the goal to get-to-the-center.
9583	1	a	Tired of too much free time? Destroy it with this awesome game. Don't blame me if you forget to sleep or eat...
9585	1	a	More fun than you'd think, multiplayer would be a wonderful addition.
9587	1	a	Just got this game over the xmas sale. I've really impressed with it! Great fun, a bit of a challenge, and it'll offer hours of good fun.
9589	1	a	This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet. The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.  Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...
9591	1	a	i got this game when it was free and now i have to pay for it lol talk about a bit of a fail but still was fun
9593	1	a	1
9595	1	a	This game is really fun, a unique space simulator.
9597	1	a	Hours of fun! Legit i love this game!!!!!!!!!!! =^w^=
9599	1	a	Best RPG/Semi RTS I have Played in a long time recommend for people wanting to Blow Sh*t up in space
9601	1	a	Very simple gameplay, but addicting as ♥♥♥♥. Also nice difficulty later on.
9603	1	a	A must have for any avid strategy nut. And you don't even need to be THAT skilled with real time to beat the game! get it now!
9605	1	a	reking scrubs on this is more fun than jumping of a building naked with no eyes  11/10
9607	1	a	I think they absolutely nailed the combat in the game, any grind-fan will love this kind of combat. Those that don't like grind, dont buy the game. For the rest go for it when it's on a sale or something. There also is some replayability for those that like that.  Also, don't buy it for the story as it is 100% cheesy.
9609	1	a	Yes, this a great game. I played it during the time were is was freely avaiable for a weekend an clocked like 30 hours on in. Its a great game 8.5/10
9611	1	a	It's fun, just buy it already. Worth every penny!
9613	1	a	Awesome space game. It's got customization and interesting combat as well as a randomly generated open galaxy.
9615	1	a	Another solid space shooter
9617	1	a	This game was made by 2 indie developers and is probably one of the best indie games I've ever played. It's well worth the money for the amount of content and replayability this game has. It allows you to travel between stars and fight or help the local factions (UTA and civilians) and forge your way through the galaxy to the core. The combat is fun and the tactics screen is surprisingly in depth, allowing for complete control of the AI controlled ships (you can only manually control one ship but you have a small fleet following you) for those that enjoy that. One thing I will say is that the menus, HUD and UI in this game are astonishing; it feels so clean, polished and futuristic as a sci-fi game should, probably my favourite part of the game. Considering this was made by two people and not a big, well known title it is a great game. You can really tell the amount of effort they put into this and for that I applaud them.  9/10
9619	1	a	It gets you addicted in no time. Fun, entertaining to play. One of the best indie titles out there without doubt.
9621	1	a	Probably the best indy game I've played. Awesome space combat, huge star maps to explore. Research system, leveling your ships, etc. This is a must have.
9623	1	a	Awwwwwwwwwwwww yeah. This game is awesome.
9625	1	a	SPAZ is truly one of the best games i have played since years.  Sure, it does not offer the brilliant uber graphics from many modern shooters, but hey - that is neither intended nor necessary. The whole rest - including gameplay itself, long-term motivation and simply FUN to play - is totally worth it. It is as if you can feel around every little corner of the game how much heart has been put into it.  Considering the fact that this game was created by mainly only two guys, it is a true masterpiece.  Very good job, guys!
9627	1	a	I'm not the type with time or patience for complicated games, however this game is not too simple that it's boring, and too complicated that it's tedious, it stoke a perfect balance for me. This game has an old school feel, I get a nice nostalgia feeling playing it, it's my favorite game at the moment.  We need more games like it, gameplay &gt; gfx ANYTIME !
9629	1	a	Great game, rare to find good space shooters
9631	1	a	Fight, Collect, Upgrade, Explore. It takes a few basic videogame elements and combines them into a enjoyable whole. The best space ship game I have played in a long while.
9633	1	a	Best 10 bucks I ever spent, highly reccomend trying the demo. You'll be hooked.
9635	1	a	A little bit like asteroids. But, more addictive. Somewhat of a plot...but the story line is pretty mindless. Different types of missions but, it wont be the end of the world if you lose a mission. No need to constantly save the game. Fun and a good distraction.  
9637	1	a	A excellent space exploration game with some awesome space battles. Extremely addictive and fun, the battles just get bigger and better not to mention creating your own fleet as you progress.  Well spent $15. This game could be worth double and I'd gladly buy it.
9639	1	a	Its the dark souls of space.  YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY.  But buy it.
9641	1	a	Fun and modable :P Get it either on sale or not!!!! Worth owning.
9643	1	a	Robotron: 2084 (1982) Smash TV (1990) Llamatron (1991) Total Carnage (1992) Operation: Inner Space (1994) Geometry Wars (2003) Starscape (2008) Spore, specifically the space stage (2008)  If you liked any of the above, try this out. It most closely resembles Operation: Inner Space and Starscape. Try the PC demo, it's free.
9645	1	a	This game is BAWLIN' yo! Spaceships be pew pew like you never SEEN! I flew one and I was like 'WHAAAAAT!' Are you serious SPAZ?' Mean people in the police faction though. This one chick wouldn't even let me holla. I was like 'please you ugly anyway'.
9647	1	a	Fun and addictive a good time sink.
9649	1	a	Really fun game, although it does not look appealing at first, it is a really good game, if you are into these kind of games that is.
9651	1	a	Pretty Good Game.
9653	1	a	The learning curve is not conducive to casual play... beyond that, fun and engaging game.
9655	1	a	This is a game of a style (had I the time and the talent) I have always wanted to make. It's a very pleasant combination of genres. The closest game I can think of that would be similar is Starscape.  Shoot asteroids for resources, kill ships for xp and crew. Defeat a new type of ship and you get their blueprint. Get enough of that blueprint and you can build that ship. Blast your way through blockades, or trade and bribe your way past.  The loadout interface is surprisingly easy. It's fun experimenting with different components and weapons on different hardpoints of different hulls. Do I add a way stronger blaster and hope I don't run out of reactor power in the middle of a fight? Do I prefer speed or maneuverability? Cloak or shields? Bombs, drones, torpedoes or missiles? Tracking turrets or forward-facing sheer oomph?  The middle-end of the game gets a bit grindy, but the collector/completionist in me still has plenty to do. The developers are cool and keep adding stuff!
9657	1	a	Fight, Collect, Upgrade, Explore. It takes a few basic videogame elements and combines them into a enjoyable whole. The best space ship game I have played in a long while.
9659	1	a	Quite a fun little game if you're into this sort of thing. You know the drill, you start with a piece of crap ship and slowly fight and upgrade your way across the galaxy until you have a fleet of doom.
9661	1	a	Extremely addictive and fun game. Very well done and polished as well. This is one superb indie title.
9663	1	a	Addictive top down space shooter glowing ♥♥♥♥ collecter game that is somewhere between Star Control 1 and EV: Nova. You control a bit fat Pirate ship that slightly smaller ships launch from and you around killing ♥♥♥♥ and picking up glowing ♥♥♥♥ from their space wreckages that gives you experience points (Data), resource points (called Rez) and slaves (Goons) who work for you and who you can trade for Data or Rez like the worthless scum they are. Also, you pick up new ship schematics by killing fools, which in turn gives you bigger and badder ships to kill people with and collect more ♥♥♥♥. Insidious.
9665	1	a	Top down space shooter with an addictive progression system. It feels like a 2D Freelancer flying around upgrading ships, blowing up pirates, civilians, zombies, police cruisers all the while upgrading your little band of mercenary ships makes for an absolutely fantastic time.   The open ended nature of the game gives the player freedom to go where they like while the narrative gives a general direction on where to go next. Combat is fluid and each ship handles a little differently as a space game should. All this made by two people. Weapon and ship upgrades keep the player going for 'just a bit longer' into the wee hours of next week.  Get it, play it, love it. 
9667	1	a	my favorite indie game. more people should buy it
9669	1	a	It's well phat, mate.
9671	1	a	If you're a fan of retro style top-down shooters with space themes and RPG progression elements SPAZ is a good bit of fun. That said, if you're the type that becomes frustrated with unbalanced and in some cases broken ability trees I would avoid SPAZ (and any sequels) until it becomes sufficiently cheap for you to not care.
9673	1	a	My only issues were...  Pacing: It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours. Also if you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them. And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use. Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.  Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game. I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.
9675	1	a	All i can say is i LOVE this game and Really wish there was a workshop for it cos this would be awesome with mods ! :)
9677	1	a	it was pretty cool but they could have put a tiny bit bigger effort.................
9679	1	a	-Space -Pirates -Zombies Nuff said
9681	1	a	Best top-down game since GTA2. Can't wait for the sequel. 10/10 That GOTY 2011 award is legit
9683	1	a	A game that is a bit like Star Control 2, except without that annoying time limit, more ships, more ship upgrades oh and zombies. The game can get pretty hard, especially when you have to deal with zombies, as they can subvert your ships.
9685	1	a	Just got this game over the xmas sale. I've really impressed with it! Great fun, a bit of a challenge, and it'll offer hours of good fun.
9687	1	a	Dumb amounts of fun.
9689	1	a	A lot of fun. A good buy if on sell. 
9691	1	a	I bought Space, Pirates, and Zombies (SPAZ) on sale for $2. I liked it so much I bought 4 more copies to give to family and friends so the developer would get the full $10 asking price out of me. Easily the best $10 I've spent on steam to date.
9693	1	a	Surprisingly this is a very good indie game, one of the best I've played.  This is a real-time space shooter game that has some RPG and strategy elements in it. Combined together, it is actually a very addictive game that keeps you playing. You can have a fleet of up to 4 ships, and with it you gather resources, unlock new ships and technology, level up for talent points, trade with the 2 factions in the game to become more powerful. You can help or hinder either of the two factions, and the number of ships they can field in battle will increase or decrease, making your actions influence the galaxy.  The graphics, sound and story are decent enough, but the game-play is top notch.  As of this recommendation, the game is good enough despite being simple. But it could be so much more and the developers plan to add more content. If you have some spare change, consider buying it during a sale and help fund the sequel, SPAZ 2.

9697	1	a	If you like old school space shooters (asteroids) but like the story and graphics of modern space shooters (Halo) then this is the game for you

9703	1	a	Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times. The difficultly curve is just right to prove enough challenge to keep things interesting and the progression keeps things fresh enough as to not become too repetitive or dull.   I love games that really give you a sense of progression and feel where your actions actually matter. The end-game micromanagement is just tough enough to keep you on your toes but not cause you to rage quit. If you like top-down arcade shooters, flying around as a pirate, managing your own fleet, saving the galaxy, or any combination there of, you should give this a look.
9705	1	a	This is a fun and cheap indie game. I've really enjoyed playing with the different ship loadouts and trying to combo them together in unique ways. It's a basic top down 2D shooter type with spaceships. The physics are a little strange at first, but easy to get the hang of. Once you start planet hoping and blasting through the security gates, the game really picks up.  Don't be afraid to wrekt everyone that gets in your way. You earn more by killing enemies than anything else. Relationships with the UTA/Civs don't really matter unless you can't wipe them out easily.  My only complaint: The AI for your ships auto-pilot is horrible. The programming for any advanced tactics isn't really there. My ships often would fly directly into the face of enemy fleets and sit still trying to face off against everything at once, no evasive manuevers of any kind. There's not really anything you can do about it except try to switch and make them move out of the line of fire quickly. However, the instant you leave a ship... it begins Rambo-ing in.  But honestly that didn't become a big issue until near the end when ships are expensive and extremely powerful.  I've had a great time playing despite the AI weakness
9707	1	a	Perfect game to waste your time.
9709	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.  You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.  The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.  Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.  The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.  The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.  The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.  Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.  In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.  Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.  This game simply rocks and you have to try it.
9711	1	a	This is a amazing game. I love it. The story line is just pure bliss.... can't wait for the second game of it.   Buy this game if you love to comit to games, love single player, and love huge fleets of destruction in space. Oh and zombies. :D  It took me 64 hours to complete the game, and thats just sticking with the story and not doing any of the secondary option, and there are TONS.  Over 2 years, I finished it. gg
9713	1	a	I logged over a hundred hours on this puppy! It is a LOT of fun. Five cents an hour for great fun? Can't beat it.
9715	1	a	Space Pirats and Zombies is a fantastic achievement in of itself. Its in the same vein as the old Star Control games in that it features an entirely 'Top Down' perspective space combat experience. Despite what may seem like a straight forward simple game at first glance will quickly be washed away by how massive the galaxy can be if you so choose. SPAZ sports an intuitive levelling system where you earn points to spend on research to boost the attributes of several systems of your ships. From shields to turrets to the crew itself, the inner workings of your vessels will be fine tuned as you grow. Where you choose to research also determines what higher quality systems you will be able to implement as you acquire various blueprints for more efficient arms and armors.   I would highly recommend this game to any and all who enjoy space combat. Its very action packed and exciting, at least in my opinion.  It is truly the triumph of a motivated two man development team!  
9717	1	a	This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish. Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off. When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships. .
9719	1	a	Great game, loads of fun :)
9721	1	a	Its a great game. I beat it the first time on a small map in about 40 hours. That is a small map. 40 hours in a game is well worth the money but throw in the replayability of this game and youve got a great little time killer on your hands that has a lot of potential for expansion.    I'd give this game a 8/10 which is high for me. I'd love to see the customization of ships expanded and maybe a little more control on the AI of your fleet. but other than that, its a quality game.
9723	1	a	Nice concept and execution! I like it!
9725	1	a	my favorite indie game. more people should buy it
9727	1	a	it was pretty cool but they could have put a tiny bit bigger effort.................
9729	1	a	Played tons, great game
9731	1	a	This is very nice This is a complementary review.  The difficulty settings are thouroughly thought. Any complaint about difficulty, rebuilding, etc.  Is the player's fault. The difficulty settings, and map/campaign customs at the begining are directly related to adapt the game to you. if your a massive noob, choose the according settings!  This is a complementary review.
9733	1	a	Super fun, really enjoyed this on the Free weekend
9735	1	a	Great game - the trailer shows the gameplay perfectly.  You will have lots of fun playing this game and there will be moments where you genuinely LOL(such as when your cannons blast a hole in an enemy ship and a whole crapload of their crew get squirted out into space, wriggling like maggots.. then get squished by another passing ship). The start is a bit slow but once you've opened up several star systems and obtained blueprints to your first large ship it picks up momentum; once you start collecting blueprints for huge ships it really shines. Another recent reviewer complained about spending half his time mining - you only need to do that very early on, after that it becomes a pastime to blast enemy ships and scoop up what's left of them to get rich.  The cons: you may get very addicted!
9737	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master. Lengthy campaign that is allot of fun. The programmer's kept it simple, and knew how to manage their efforts well.
9739	1	a	Best top-down RPG arcade space shooter around.
9741	1	a	I'm in space. SPAAACE!
9743	1	a	Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times.

9745	1	a	I spent 72 hours in the game so far. It's like 3 days and 3 nights of addictive fun for 10 EUR. Worth it.
9747	1	a	Very interesting game to design your battle ship and fight humans or zombies. Collecting componets and looking for the favorate combination in battle are always addictive.
9749	1	a	I loved it all the way through, can't wait for SPAZ 2!
9751	1	a	AWSOME TOP DOWNSPACE GAME : arcade controlls, detailed salvage and mining, awsome ship upgrades, totaly worth ownig and playing!
9753	1	a	Fun balance of tactics and strategy. Potential for very rewarding battles on smaller maps. Can become a bit of a grind on larger maps (&gt;200 stars).
9755	1	a	Lots of fun exploring the galaxy, upgrading your ships and of course, fighting off zombies. Decent story. Just a well-made game with no glaring flaws.
9757	1	a	I got this on sale thinking I might get an afternoon out of it but I got so much more.   One thing I noticed, this game has an addiction factor much like the civilization games. Every mission you do makes you want to push on to see what's next, got to get that next ship or that next weapon.   GRAPHICS: are very detailed for a 2D game and throw out some nice effects, for example the explosions are pretty decent with bits being blasted off as you bring down a ship slowly, crew being sucked out of a breach in the hull and there are some rather nice backdrops with small details you can appreciate when you zoom in.   SOUND: isn't overbearing, there is an effect for everything but it just lacks a little punch for my tastes. I would have liked the weapons to sound a bit meatier, right now they sound like pings and pops. The explosions however do sound pretty good when you blow up something big. There is some interesting and funny radio chatter that will put a smile on your face.   MUSIC: very much suits a game of this type, it doesn't try to overshadow the sound effects or deafen you when you're in a firefight...which is almost always. It's the kind of music that sticks in your head when you're not playing the game.   Your currencies are well balanced and you never have too much, you will of course always run out but then there's always a way to make back the lost currency, unlike a lot of games where you have way too much money and nothing to spend it on, I really do hate that in a lot of games.   I'm blown away by how addicting this game is without feeling like it's a sugar rush. What I mean is that it won't give you all of the cool stuff in the first 5 minutes of the game and then you have to grind for another 50 hours without anything awesome to discover. No, this game is one of the best paced games I've ever played and the balance of leveling, tech points and weapon acquisition over the course of the entire game will give you the feeling that you ate the whole cake, not just a bunch of icing or just the cake without icing.....if you catch my drift.   At the time of this review, I've clocked 45 hours but I'm still having a blast, still have a lot to discover and upgrade but at the same time I kinda don't want to finish this game. You know something is good when you want it to go on. I just hope SPAZ 2 has that same feeling....
9759	1	a	A nice top-down shoot-em-up. Despite the title, it's really a lot more Space Pirate, and a lot less zombies. Until the second half of the game - where there is too much zombies.  Progression is just slightly grindy, but each time you get an upgrade you want it makes the wait worthwhile.  Before entering the final zone it's best to fully upgrade and at least have one full huge spaceship. There won't be places to farm Rez for recovery if you're too weak in the final zone.  Overall a great way to kill time. And space.
9761	1	a	Probably the best 2-D shooter I've played. Good integration of upgrade system and resource management as well.
9763	1	a	This is the best two dollars I've ever spent on a game. (I picked this up on a steam sale)
9765	1	a	Just buy it
9767	1	a	It's fairly fun, the developers put way more content into this game, and it's a good value. Gameplay is reptitive, the story is ignorable, and there's going to be straight out grinding to get through the second half of the game. It will eat up dull hours though.
9769	1	a	Great game. Love the story, love the mechanics, love the combat and gameplay.
9771	1	a	I love this game and I hope the sequel is coming out soon.
9773	1	a	Let's wait for Space Pirates and Zombies 2
9775	1	a	It's well phat, mate.
9777	1	a	A little slow at first, but once you get your first few blueprints for new ships, the amount of customziation you can do is amazing!  Fun top-down space shooter, a blend of space invaders, battletech, and Duke Nukem [the humor]. The grahics are both fun, and don't seem to get old very fast. Space shooter plus customizable space craft &amp; tech tree to support your particular playstyle. Like missles or lazers? Want to use mega-bombers, or carriers with a small fleet of its own craft? You get to decide which ships to build in your 'home base', how they are armed, etc.  Well worth the price.
9779	1	a	toltaly awsome 
9781	1	a	What's not to love about a game that lets you fly through the galaxy being a giant prick? Tight controls and a very satisfying combat system can drag you into playing this game for hours saying 'Just a few more levels...'  The physics engine is on point and all ships have a very unique 'feel' to them, tight and responsive fighters, weighty and bulky Doom Cruisers, a little bit of everything in between. Be warned though, being a ♥♥♥♥♥ure Han Solo and getting your flagship destroyed too many times will have you farming up the cash to continue plundering the inner galaxy for hours, the endless grind for money is the only negative on an otherwise flawless indie space shmup. 9/10 
9783	1	a	Does what it aims to accomplish, does an alright job. A little too much detail, bogs down progression. But it was fun!
9785	1	a	Charming and fun. I can see why people spend many hours in it.
9787	1	a	good if you like space/shooter games,the zombies arent too easy to spot but in the later levels you get them all the time.
9789	1	a	I loved it all the way through, can't wait for SPAZ 2!
9791	1	a	Great story and a lot of fun to just try and kill everyone. Neither is too easy.
9793	1	a	Very fun with a gameplay experience that lasts a long time for the price
9795	1	a	Does what it aims to accomplish, does an alright job. A little too much detail, bogs down progression. But it was fun!
9797	1	a	I really love this game. It's simple, to the point, and contains a lot of quality mindless classic top down shooter features with strategy game overtones.  I'm looking forward to the sequel to this game and will be happy to pay full price since it was created by two guys that love games.
9799	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies is a neat little top-down 2D space game. The premises are simple - blow up spacecraft, steal their blueprints (black boxes,) and collect some rocks ('Rez') and other people in space so you can replace your own ships that get blown up.  The game itself has plenty of content, but it's served up cut and dry - and depending on how you generate your galaxies, it can turn into a horrible, horrible grind for resources. If you're bored, rack up some bounty with the bounty hunters, then warp between a bunch of systems under their control. You'll have a bit of extra fun fighting them, simply because they tend to be reasonably stronger than the average cannon fodder provided at that time in the game.  Combat is well-designed, with many facets to it. Continuously firing your weapons and holding down your engines while your shield's trying to recharge is a great way to empty out your power supply, leaving you defenseless. Armor and 'Rez' have weight to them - need extra speed? Dump that 'Rez' you're holding onto. Need to go even faster? Jettison your armor. Certain weapons will deal more damage to a component - lasers will tear shields apart, cannons rip armor to shreds, and missiles deal the most hull damage. Certain odd weapons will deal more damage to different sources for some variety. If you feel daring, ditch your shield for a cloak - while it provides superficial protection, you'll get extra cannon and laser damage while cloaked. Don't rely on your allied spacecraft to be useful for anything other than taking weapons fire, as their intelligence goes as far as 'fly straight at them and turn tail when I'm about to explode.'  Ships can mount a variety of different equipment, but once you understand where everything needs to go, it ends up being that you run Tugs and Grinders for most of the mid-game simply because of how versatile their multitudes of mounts and rotating mount points are, while most other designs become moot. Some equipment seems to become relatively useless simply because of their implementations, while others are so dangerous to everyone that it requires a degree of skill to use. However, this all depends on how you spec your skills.  With that being said, SPAZ can be run on some pretty horrible computers. I've been able to play it at a consistent 60fps on a craptop with only a Celeron 900. If you're going somewhere without Internet or simply just need to burn time, SPAZ is there.    Hits:  - Very lightweight game - Decently in-depth combat mechanics, such as armor and resources weighing your craft down (And jettisoning them makes your craft faster) - Great time sink - Some characters are quirky enough to be mildly rememberable   Misses:  - Quickly becomes grindy - Soundtrack wafts between good and bad - Idiotic AI tends to get itself killed quite often,   especially when the zombies show up      TL;DR   SPAZ is a good game to pick up if you're on a budget and need a game to burn time with. Its low hardware requirements mean that you can plonk it on just about any given computer and it'll run like a scalded ape. Combat is fun and is actually one of the deepest pieces of the game. There's a variety of weapons and ship designs for you to experiment with and perfect. However, grinding and a lack of content means that a second playthrough is generally only done when you have nothing better to do.   Score:  7/10
9801	1	a	Do you have fond memories of Star Control 2, but wish it had more zombies? There's a game for that.
9803	1	a	This game is rediculously fun and comical. It has so much to offer and is really well thought out. The game can also be modified to how fast you want to complete it, and also leaves room for almost endless customization of your ships. They also plan to update with future improvments like more ships, modules, missions, and storyline. If you asked me about this, I'd tell you to get it in a heartbeat.
9805	1	a	This game is way addictive, I remember playing it at my cabin when I didn't have any internet, and it kept me entertained for 27 hours. Unfortunately, because I was offline it never saved my play time (game saved just fine though), but I would definitely recommend this game. easily an 8.5/10
9807	1	a	Is SPAZ really an offensive title? Who says SPAZ anymore? Am I SPAZ? These are questions we need answered.
9809	1	a	SPAZ is a great space-combat game. I haven't played a space game this fun since Escape Velocity: Nova. If the 2D space genre at all interests you, you need to buy it, now. Fans of this game should also take a look at Drox Operative, which takes a more Diablo-esque stance to space combat, though I find that controls in that game to be less fun.  This game, though fun, lacks a fair amount of depth. it has it's problems, and I shall list some of those out here. Make no mistake, my overall rating for this game would still be an 8/10.  First of all, alt+tabbing is a bit of a pain. You need an active window to tab into otherwise it won't work. The intro movies, though short, are not skippable. Skipping the tutorial leaves you at a bit of a disadvantage level wise. I cannot figure out enemy aggro. Sometimes, they choose to target exclusively my own ships despite other enemy ships attacking them. On a mission to kill enemy scouts, if the scouts are friendly, it is impossible because my own ships will not target them. I cannot select enemy ships to be targeted from the tactical menu. Targeting specific enemy ships can be a pain sometimes and this would help immensely. Enemy ships will often only attack my escorts. And my escorts will fly way off to attack enemy ships. This has led to all my rez being depleted while I just sit there and do nothing. More AI options are needed. Even defensive AI is way too aggressive. An AI option where friendly ships never leave the screen would be nice. Better yet, formations would be a welcome addition to the game. Even just one basic formation would be extremely helpful in keeping my fleet in line. Friendly AI ships get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off way too easily. There aren't enough missions to weaken the enemy faction in a given system. This forces me to either attack a level 3 space station, or make peace with the enemy at the expense of my ally.  As a final sidenote, I love the radio chatter that goes on. You should allow people to upload their own chatter for inclusion into the game somehow.
9811	1	a	I love this game and I hope the sequel is coming out soon.
9813	1	a	I spent 72 hours in the game so far. It's like 3 days and 3 nights of addictive fun for 10 EUR. Worth it.
9815	1	a	It's well phat, mate.
9817	1	a	Lot's of arcade style space shootemup fun! This game should be in every users library.
9819	1	a	Great game, tonnes of depth, zombies, huge battles, zombies, Did I mention it has zombies, SPACE ZOMBIES?! Worth a laugh if you can pick it up for a few quid, expansion is something that you can take or leave. Have Fun!
9821	1	a	This is a good, solid game. Lots of fun, but hard to learn flying controls. Awesome on Alienware. Colours change on keyboard &amp; mouse depending on your situation, is turning red when low health etc.
9823	1	a	One of my favorites. This game took the basic 2D motion of Asteroids and turned it into a very entertaining space saga. The graphics are fun, the story is wild and the basic gameplay is a blast. The only stumbling block is that some of the potential builds are really terrible such as a stealth, missile or mine setup. The game forces you into beams or particle weapons if you want to kill anything in a reasonable amount of time. I look forward to the next effort by this developer.
9825	1	a	Free roaming, trading, factions, and a wide variety of ships to command in your squad. One cannot ask for more from this game, hours of gameplay and a great variety of upgrades and weapons make this game unique and exhilarating.
9827	1	a	Awesome throwback to the days of Armada. Lots of fun.
9829	1	a	Great game
9831	1	a	Deceptively simple in nature though with scale comes complexity. If you enjoy seeing your ships grow in size and fire power, this is an extremely fulfilling experience.
9833	1	a	Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top-down, 2D space pirate combat game where you explore the galaxy completing quests, finding resources, and upgrading your ships. There is a story here, but in between heavy grinding sessions, I forgot what was actually going on. Overall, the game is fun and the combat is exciting, but I did get frustrated many times after getting thoroughly whooped on the battlefield (battle-space?). Hopefully SPAZ 2 will be released soon with improved features and gameplay.  PROS + Controls are intuitive once you get used to them (WASD oriented towards mouse pointer) + Combat is mostly fun and exciting + Large number of ship upgrades and modules to purchase and find + Customizing ships is fun (weapons, armor, subsystems, specialists) + Resources (currency, data, and manpower) are plentiful + Each star system has factions to interact with via quests and events (but...see CON)  CONS - Mothership can only be upgraded after certain story missions (required for most other upgrades) - Grinding is necessary to advance - Most missions ultimately feel the same (battle after battle after battle...) - Since faction respect doesn't carry between systems, it feels rather unimportant long-term - Needs autosave function
9835	1	a	Awesome throwback to the days of Armada. Lots of fun.
9837	1	a	Fantastic game. Eagerly awaiting the sequel. Seriously, buy this...very worth it!
9839	1	a	Great game, super simple. Has hours of playability.  
9841	1	a	Great game!  I had an absolute blast playing through spaz and would definitly play it again! This well crafted 2D game builds up quite nicely and is longer than I expected which is really nice for a change. I love when I unlock the ship im gunning for and unleash a can of tracking laser beams onto an over-eager enemy! Then throw the survivors out the airlock just becasue I can hahaha!! At least thats how it goes on in my head.  Would be nice though if the galaxy was divided into a few more factions, besides that its an all round 2 thumbs up!!
9843	1	a	After I understood the game (controls/menu/what am I doing?) I've got to say: One of the best indie games I've played so far. The soundeffects are a bit lowfi, but it has modding ablities, so maybe theres a way to replace them. Doesn't really affect the overall manifique experience
9845	1	a	Space Shoot 'em Up/RPG-ish mashup. Quite fun, though it gets a little repetitive towards the end.
9847	1	a	This is, like, a message from the Resistance, man. F*ck you too, dudes, just say no to cannibalism! ZOMBIES are REAL!!!!
9849	1	a	Absolutely loving this game. Reminds me in a way of an old Macintosh game that I loved called Escape Velocity, but they didn't have ZoMbIeS!!!! Great game guys, can NOT wait until the second comes out!!!!
9851	1	a	A procedurally generated space dogfighting game with a little bit of RTS micromanagement thrown in. While the story isn't the most in-depth you'll run across, SPAZ has enough content generated every time you load up a new universe to keep you on your toes every single playthrough.
9853	1	a	This game boasts some serious action, requiring skill and speed to take down the enemy. It is well worth the $$$
9855	1	a	In space nobody can hear you scream... unless you are on the right radiofrequency!
9857	1	a	Awesome game. Get it!
9859	1	a	a great game although between each of the story objectives it does require you to grind a bit
9861	1	a	A GREAT Game!   - A lot of ships and configs.  - Immersive history. - Funny zombies.  - A lot of missons.    I played since 2012, Never boring. I'm excited to continue in SPAZ 2.     Thank you Producers.
9863	1	a	Great shoot-em'-up title that reminds me of similar PC games of the past. Very cool!
9865	1	a	An arcade-like game with old school graphics and game-play that is lots of fun.  Build up your tech tree as you move from system to system, persuing the over-arching mission. Every system presents a new chance for local missions; choose some locals to help or fight as you make your way to more difficult systems.  Salvage hull designs to build your fleet. Set the AI of your companions to suit your objectives. Jump into the pilots seat of any vessle you have in the map.  Build and outfit different hulls for different roles and swap between them in a quick, easy way.  The whole thing adds up to being a blast to play.  As a bonus, the developers seem like a stand up bunch. Throwing them enough for a beer is little enough recompense for the many hours of fun I have had with their creation.  Five Stars. Would Kill Space Zombies Again.
9867	1	a	Literally cheap as chips and you will enjoy it longer.
9869	1	a	Install a BigBeffmod when you got bored of the chapter four. Don't make a galaxy with more than 150 systems, unless you would like to grind.
9871	1	a	Fantastic time waster. Needs more content. Still, tons of fun especially if it's on sale.
9873	1	a	A modern take on the classic Star Control. Nicely done, lots of ship building options and research paths. A bit grindy at times but a great game.
9875	1	a	Seems grindy at first but it's pretty addictive and you don't mind playing missions over and over to advance and explore its universe. I suppose it will get repetitve eventually but it's been a lot of fun so far...
9877	1	a	A procedurally generated space dogfighting game with a little bit of RTS micromanagement thrown in. While the story isn't the most in-depth you'll run across, SPAZ has enough content generated every time you load up a new universe to keep you on your toes every single playthrough.
9879	1	a	Edit: 1/10/2016 This game is still a blast to play. Get it and look forward to SPAZ 2!   ---- First things first, one of the devs of this game gave away a bunch of keys for free on Reddit. Just to be nice! That's quite the act of kindness coming from a very small Independent game. However, I did not receive a key. Instead, I purchased the game since it was available for $3.99 as a weekend deal.   I sat down with it once it downloaded, poured me a spot of Scotch, and started playing. Seven hours (!) later I realize that it was now quite early in the morning and I still found myself thinking 'Just one more mission'. This is easily one of the most satisfying Indie games in my library. Addicting, colorful, witty, and overall killer experience.  I suggest picking this up at any price, a stellar title with some down-to-earth developers.
9881	1	a	Incredibly fun and addicting, I couldn't stop playing it. Anyone who enjoys a really deep top-down shooter should love SPAZ.
9883	1	a	Simple game, a lot of fun. Well worth $5 USD
9885	1	a	its a kick A$$ game while i not visited al teh planets yest one cane say it half the fun is getting there
9887	1	a	BUY. THIS. GAME. That is all.
9889	1	a	What, you DON'T like being a space pirate? Or getting huge lasers and plasma cannons to shoot people with? Or flying around shooting innocent civilian and military members you JUST were allies with simply because you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space pirate and that's what you ♥♥♥♥ing do? Or kicking the ♥♥♥ of weird alien zombie necromorph spaceship... things?   What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you?
9891	1	a	Really Really awesome! Sucked up 47 hours of my life!
9893	1	a	Had a blast! Can't wait for the sequel to go on sale! :)
9895	1	a	Great game to kill some time, but gets repetitive after a while.
9897	1	a	This is one of those games that just keeps you coming back for more! There are lots of ways to customize and a cheesy but fun storyline. I had a lot of fun playing this and getting all of the achievements.   All in all, zombies, space and lasers are a good combination!
9899	1	a	Cool design, innovative gameplay, very long lifetime game. Good Devs and Modding Community, littlely repetitive, but who cares when youre fleet admiral, and crush ennemy flotilla by ten different ways? Try Mods... And Try SPAZ 2, with same refs, but totally different gameplay
9901	1	a	One of the best indie games of all time.  Very well executed visual style. lots of replayability. Absolutly recommended  9/10
9903	1	a	very fun game with good rpg aspects.
9905	1	a	Great game and story.
9907	1	a	The developers' pet project as the game they always wanted to play turns out to be one I've always wanted to play (and that you should too). SPAZ is one of the most brilliantly-executed 2D arcade space combat/trading games I've encountered. The depth is there, with research trees for technologies and blueprints for imaginative ship designs, with customizable weapon loadouts, and with over 200 star systems to explore per galaxy. There are hours upon hours of just plain fun gameplay to be had in this gem.
9909	1	a	This game is amazing, i love it. It reminds me of an old game called solar winds. 10/10
9911	1	a	Every time I come back to this, I enjoy it a little more. Not much I can say to describe why I like it, except that it scratches that itch for space combat and ship customization. Mods are pretty tight too.
9913	1	a	Blah! This is like...everything I want from Galactic Civilizations, Sins of s Solar Empire, and Smugglers....plus ZOMBEEZ! Epic $15 spent should you like these sort of games. ^_^
9915	1	a	Great blend of 2D arcadey-sandbox action and RPG space shooter
9917	1	a	I don't normally write reviews, so I'll just say a few blurbs.  I liked this game so much, I bought it 3 times. And once as a gift for a friend.   The 2nd one is coming out tomorrow. I'll buy it at launch, just because the developers have earned it from this game. And I normally wait for a huge sale, or GOTY edition before I spend any $.
9919	1	a	It's a good game, if you like long-term space top-down shooters.
9921	1	a	Welcome to Space Pirates And Zombies (And Bounty Hunters)!    This is a game for all who love to be able to do some customization to their spaceship, explore the galaxy, form alliances and upgrade their ship in diffrent ways. This game also has an interesting plot and you learn more about it as you go.  Just want to say something before you start: Civs = Civilians UTA = United Terran Alliance    HUGE GALAXY TO EXPLORE: There can be up to 300 star systems to explore! And each one has a few diffrent areas (like planets, junk yards, awesome empty space, toxic waste dumpyards, asteroid fields) where you will find the mission, event and conflict zones. But even if the area doesn't currently have a mission in it, some valuable resources can still be found there.    BLUEPRINTS AND BLACK BOXES: There are Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge hulls to choose from, you get new ones by picking up black boxes (drops from Civilian, UTA, Bounty Hunter and Zombie ships when they explode) or hacking the ships with a special kind of 'weapon'. All mid to late game ship hulls need multiple black boxes to be fully unlocked.  There is a wide variety of beams, cannons, launchers, bombs, mines, drones, turrets, subsystems, armor, reactors, engines, shields and cloaks to choose from. You can buy the blueprints from the Civilians (refugees who fled from Earth) and the UTA (some kind of corrupt space police). Some items need multiple blueprints before you fully unlock them, and to be able to use the stronger weapons, you need to do some research with data you collect. Data drops from ships belonging to the Civs, the UTA, the Bounty Hunters or the Zombies, but you could just do some missions to get it.    SPACE STATIONS: All 4 factions (Civs, UTA, Bounty Hunters and Zombies) have their own space stations, and these space stations can come in diffrent sizes. The Civilians have Mining, Science and Colony space stations, each one of those come in 3 diffrent sizes. The UTA just have 3 sizes of Security Stations. The Bounty Hunters have Outposts and Bounty Hunter Strongholds. Known Zobie space stations: Infested Outpost, Heart, Artery.    RESPECT AND BOUNTY: The UTA blockade the stargates which you need to open first if you want to be able to go to the next star system. To do so you either attack them, bribe them at the UTA's base (with goons of course), or hire a raid on the gates at the Bounty Hunters' base (although hiring a raid causes you to lose the Bounty Hunters' respect).  The Bounty Hunters (Space Pirates) will attack you if you have alot of bounty on your head (destroying the other factions' ships or starbases puts bounty on your head). You should try to prevent getting too much bounty (as their ships are armed to the teeth). But getting high bounty on purpose to draw their ships out for the black boxes is a very good idea. A fast way to get bounty is in Conflicts, here the Civs and UTA forces colide in an inhabited system and start killing off each other.  But to stop them from coming after you, you have to earn their 'respect'. Destroy their ships, pay the bounty, compete in their own personal arena or do certain missions to earn respect.    MISSIONS AND AMBIENT EVENTS: In each system the UTA and the Civilians will offer you lots of diffrent missions. There's also your Main Missions, Secondary Missions and Ambient Events that you should probably try to do once you see them (both for the rewards and the lore).  The Main Missions are very hard to do, but if you succeed, you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts (sometimes). You also have to do the Main Missions to upgrade your mothership for a bigger hangar and better specialists. The bigger the hanger, the more ships you can have active at once. You can also put bigger ship hulls on then.  Secondary Missions also have a bit of lore in them and reward you with rez, data, specialists and have nice ships in them to destroy for the black boxes.  Side Missions also have nice rewards you get when you complete them, including some specialsists.  Ambient Events are a very for the loot there is to be found when doing them, here's some examples: Comet Spotted, Traffic Jam, Wreck Field, Observation Outpost, Cheap Motel. Buy the game and find out what riches there are to be found!    SPECIALISTS: By doing main and side missions, destroying ships or competing in the Bounty Hunter's arena, you get specialists. They can give you bonusses to stuff like your ship's defensive skills, offensive skills, resource collection skills etc.  All specialists also have traits, which can increase the bonusses they give you by 33% if the requirements are met. Some examples are: Friendly (likes a team), Warrior (likes stronger systems), Miner (likes mining systems), Roid Rage (happier without men) etc. Specialists come in 5 grades/rarity levels: Common (50% drop chance), Uncommon (25% drop chance), Rare (12% drop chance), Elite (6% drop chance) and Godlike (3% drop chance). The rarer the specialist is, the better bonusses it will give you.  Your mothership (the Clockwork) can only hold so many specialists, so you must pick the best ones to keep. Luckily as your mothership gets upgraded, you can hold more and more specialists. If you don't like one of your specialists or don't have enough space for him on the Clockwork, simply just throw him/her out the airlock. But if you do so, you get a small amount of data, the amount probably depends on the specialist's rarity and rank (nobody could figure it out yet).  Whenever your ship's 'data level' levels up (after gathering enough data) the current active specialist(s) gains some experience points too, they start at Rookie, and can then rank up to Veteran and eventually Master. But as far as we know a specialist's rank does nothing to increase the bonusses he/she gives you.    FRIENDS: To form alliances (with the Civs and the UTA) you have to do missions, destroy the opposing faction's base or bribe them with goons. And if the Civs, UTA or the Bounty Hunters are your 'friends', they will sometimes join you in fights against the enemy you are fighting.    GAME CURRENCY: The main currency of this game is called 'Rez' with it you buy stuff at the Civs, UTA, pay your bounty at the Bounty Hunters and upgrade the Civilian and UTA starbases in the late game near the core of your galaxy. A good way to collect Rez is by mining asteroids. Mining Bases are always mining a HUGE asteroid so go pick some tiny bits of Rez up and return them to your beacon.  There is also your crew, your mothership can hold a certain amount of crewmembers, known as goons. Your ships take some of them on missions and pick new ones up during battles. Goons can also be sold at Mining bases for Rez, sold at Science stations for data or bought at Colony stations. When your ship levels up, the mothership clones a certain percentage of its max goons, and keeps them if there's enough space onboard. If a ship (both allied and enemy ships count) is destroyed, most of its goons and Rez is ejected. Ships belonging to the Civs, UTA or Bounty Hunters also let out some data and blackboxes on destruction.  Atleast the goons get into shuttles that fly away from the exploding ship, so they mostly survive the explosion. These escape pods can only hang around there in space for a certain amount of time before they automaticly eject the goon(s) inside that then die instantly. The escape pods can also be destroyed when weapons hit them.    Anyways, Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is finally out! So go have a look at both!  And also remember to look on the wiki and read some other reviews for the stuff I didn't explain in this review.  GLHF! (Good Luck and Have Fun!)  :-D
9923	1	a	This is stupid. And yet, I have played a whole bunch of it. It filled a niche in the games market that I never really had something for. There are a lot of top down space shooters with ships and whatnot, but really, I've only played flash games in that category. I loved them immensely, so when I had a chance to pick this up, I said, why not? I still recall the first day I played it, I got into it a bit, then got dragged down to the pool by my little sister, then a thunderstorm started up, and I came back home and kept playing. How many games can you recall specifically the day you started playing?
9925	1	a	A great game and time shredder. As it was said by the developers themselves it is a game like the old ones that seem to not be built anymore nowadays. It's combination of real time combat with round based development progress are come along great. The visial representation is awesome. The gameplay has way more depth then one expects initially and the storyline is catchy. And Zombies. In Space!  Warning: Addictive!
9927	1	a	More people should play this game, ridiculously well-done for an indy title
9929	1	a	Cool retro simulation that still has an 'open world' aspect on exploring. Very nice story, and the customizations are just nice. I hope SPAZ 2 will be as good as this one.
9931	1	a	Bought it, kept playing, still remember it fondly.
9933	1	a	It has a party style RPG feel to it but in space. You can customise the ships and equipment, need money to puchase it, and expeience to equip it. you can control each ship individually, pause to give commands, or let AI run your no active ships. The story is good, but I enjoyed the gameplay more. It's very grindy.
9935	1	a	  Fun combat with nice strategic ship design.
9937	1	a	Great game, brings me back to old school arcade ship shooters. That and TI calc games.
9939	1	a	A great game and time shredder. As it was said by the developers themselves it is a game like the old ones that seem to not be built anymore nowadays.

9941	1	a	Awesome game. I put a lot of hours in this game - probably the most out of any indie title.  If you ever like overhead space shooters, but always wished for a little more RPG elements in it, then this is the game for you. You can customize your ships, upgrade the ships that fly with you, and upgrade your main 'base'.   There's lots of missions to play so you never feel bored.   There's a lot of content in this game and I definitely recommend it!  Edit: The bounty hunters update added a lot to the game as well. Excited for SPAZ2!
9943	1	a	This game has all the makings of random giggles and chaotic juicy farts. Makes for an interesting yet fun time. I would recommend this game just on the fact that its so simple yet fun with random humor added. The best part is the huge lack of a full crew to have created it yet it costs next to nothing for how much fun you get out of it.
9945	1	a	Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.   At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ♥♥♥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.   Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)  However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.  Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.  In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.   Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.   (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)
9947	1	a	I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D
9949	1	a	Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have.  But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.  Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations.   Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)  If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!  I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.   READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.
9951	1	a	After some 1,400 hours on the game, I can say with FULL VALIDITY this game has ruined my life. If you like realistic physics, teamwork, and every form of warfare, this game is for you. 10/10
9953	1	a	I wanna play a Zombie game! (U can) I wanna play a realistic game! (U can) I wanna fly a plane! (U can) I wanna fly a Helicopter! (U can) I wanna drive a tank! (U can) I wanna drive a car!

9955	1	a	This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign.   Crowd around, children, it's story time.  One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.  The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his 'clan'.  I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.  This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.  My new friend was dead.  10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.
9957	1	a	I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.  Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.  You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.  You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.  The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.  I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.
9959	1	a	 ├Professors Review┤
9961	1	a	Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.  Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.
9963	1	a	The only game i'll happily play at 5 fps.
9965	1	a	 For all the haters out there; Arma 3 does not have glitches or bugs, they are called features and we  love  them.
9967	1	a	Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: '$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!' Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.  Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator   and   a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).   The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.   Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.  I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched 'tappy' sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.  Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.  So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D
9969	1	a	You can go through one whole hour of combat, with bullets blazing, without managing to spot a single enemy nor shoot a single shot. Hands down the best combat simulator there is.
9971	1	a	The best and one of the kind military simulator, with unprecedented tactical depth and wide array of additional features, like:  - Accurate ballistics &amp; penetration simulation  - Good range of vehicles to choose from  - No 'story rails' and total freedom of choice in sandbox environment  - Barely surpassed weapons/gear customization  - Greatest community out there with quality mods/addons Worth its cost on 300%
9973	1	a	I played Altis Life and a cop arrested me because I said I was black. 10/10 so realistic.
9975	1	a	This game is the reason my girlfriend of four years and I broke up.  I do not regret a thing.
9977	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
9979	1	a	I got PTSD from this game.         In the most immersive way possible.
9981	1	a	The only game where another person on the other end of the mic makes you do push ups irl.
9983	1	a	Arma 3 has taught me that 10 FPS is playable.
9985	1	a	when you begin: you will get rekt. you will forget what keys to use. you will try to quickscope. you will try to kill teammates. you will create a character with outfits that make absolutely no sense but you won't even know. you will try to spot enemies. you will try to charge in on your own. you will try to change the buttons but you will most likely fail. you will get banned for no reason.  but remember, it will be worth it because you're gonna turn into a fine warrior.
9987	1	a	It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not...  I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I had no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions.  It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful.  10/10
9989	1	a	Brilliant Military Sim sandbox. Like simulators? Like Military Shooters? Like Sanbox games that encourage mods and community content?  If yes, you should already own this.
9991	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
9993	1	a	Just look at home many hours I have spent in this game... NUFF SAID!
9995	1	a	A brilliant simulator beyond words.  Drop your CoD console controllers and get in here.   Nobody will call you a '♥♥♥♥♥♥' or a '♥♥♥♥♥♥' or threaten to ♥♥♥♥ your mother.  In here - we are all in it together, equally worthless and equally ambitious ;)  \m/
9997	1	a	-go into mp co-op server -bunch of wild old men yelling -'delta 2 4 9er we need cas at coordinates 230914' -i dont know who delta249er is -i get scared -begin shooting -accidentally kill 8 bad guys -people say i did 'good ♥♥♥♥' -get awarded medal -quit game  2/10 needs more goats
9999	1	a	Want to survive a hostile island full of haters?  You can do that.  Want a to survive a zombie apocalypse?  You can do that.  Want to scavenge for weapons and battle each other and be the best?  You can do that.  Want to run a small guerrilla army and take over Altis?  You can do that.  Like to role play island life?  You can do that.  Want to create lots cool scenarios?  You can do that.  Want to snipe your enemies or fight a conventional war?  You can do that.  Want to fart rainbows and ride a unicorn with a laser cannon horn?  Maybe one day we'll have that.
