1	1	a	this is a must have for any WW2 navy geeks..ultra realistic, tough missions, great graphics, detailed modelling. I recommentd the Pt BOAT gold pack as both original and expansion are worth the price at $14.99
0	0	a	The game could be really cool - and honestly isn't that bad when you get it to work. Do direct x 9 and you may get it to work for a while but it hard locked my computer after playing for a few minutes.
3	1	a	Great game!...Warthunder also think it is a great game!
13	0	a	This is a truly horrible game. I tried to play it for a couple of days then uninstalled it.
14	0	a	Why did I buy this?
5	1	a	 This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the  Results  and read from there.   Age of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods.    Campaign:  This is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions.    Gameplay:  Age of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team.    Teams:  This game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese.    Hints:  If you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level.    Results:  If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.   Pros: +Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game). +High level of variability in teams +Allowing for turtle or rushing player types +Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty) +Each civilization is like a whole new game +On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map. +Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map.  +Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive.  +Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support.   Cons: -Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file) -You cannot select your AI team membersâ€™ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards). -Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this). -Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography). -You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2.  -You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.
7	1	a	If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?  Well it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.  In terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos.   Though with this iteration of the series, there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly.   Another change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units.   But by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food, to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.  The singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth.   If you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.
9	1	a	I remember playing this game as a child. I would come home every day hoping that my brother wasnt playing so i could play. The game only got more fun. I only had the original game and no DLCs so when i saw this game on steam 8 years later, it was obvious that i had to buy it. If you havnt played this game yet, i acctually feel bad for you.  10/10 Would 'Tuck tuck tuck' again.
11	1	a	Age of Empires III. How can one possibly begin to review a game of such magnitude and prevalence that this game holds on the gaming world? A game that, even though it has been out for over 10 years, has a large active online community? It isnâ€™t possible, but I shall nevertheless try.  This game has a rich story, which is full of interesting historical points. Even though it is fictional, it pleasantly covers the conquests of the new world. In the vanilla version and â€œThe War Chiefsâ€ expansion, the player can endeavour to fight against various European civilisations in order to achieve glory and fame throughout the Americas. In â€œThe Asian Dynastiesâ€ expansion, it spans centuries of Asian colonialization by the British as well as the Japanese and the Chinese Dynasties.   The gameplay is a perfect reflection of the RTS genre. You slowly build your settlement to include markets, barracks and a host of other buildings, increasing your population and army before getting ready to attack your enemy or defend your settlement. Getting the fine balance between your food, wood and coin collection can be challenging but rewarding when you get it right. Will you build a good army to begin with, or a good economy, praying that your enemy wonâ€™t attack before youâ€™ve had chance to convert your good economy into a powerful army? Each of the units has a strength and a weakness. For example, skirmishers counter musketeers, cavalry counters skirmishers, and musketeers counter cavalry. So itâ€™s important to get the balance right when creating your army. The new eso-community patch has nicely levelled out the civilisations, making the OP civilisations slightly less powerful and the UP civilisations slightly more powerful.  Graphically, the game is simply gorgeous. Even though itâ€™s definitely not a new game, it doesnâ€™t feel outdated in this respect and looks magnificent from a distance (youâ€™ll want to play fully zoomed out to maximise what you can see on the screen at all times). From buildings setting on fire and slowly crumbling as they take damage, to the glorious water reflections, to the breathtaking bloom effects, youâ€™ll be wondering whether it was actually made in 2005, or 2015.  The music is purely divine. Iâ€™m listening to it as I type this as itâ€™s one of my favourite game original soundtracks of all time. As your colony grows into a mighty empire the soundtrack seamlessly transitions from slow, peaceful renaissance/discovery era, to the powerful and more rhythmic late game, mimicking the chugging of steam engines and factories as you journey into the industrial age.  Overall, a stunning game. If you havenâ€™t ever played it, buy it and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
13	1	a	10/10 Another way to ruin your social life if it already wasn't ruined to begin with.
15	1	a	A fine installation in the Age of Empires series that has a greater emphasis on combat as well as teaching you about things other than human resource management and medieval history lessons. Instead, you will gain a deep knowledge of zoology and learn how to beat up people and steal their stuff.  General: &gt;Zoology Lessons â€“ Some things you will learn: Capybaras and tapirs live in Central and South America, Ibex, Saigas, and Marco Polo sheeps live in central Asia, Serows live in Japan and the rest of Asia. &gt;Japanese Daimyos can materialize samurai out of thin air. &gt;Shogun Tokugawa is a wizard that can open portals to other worlds and summon the likes of monks with clubs, shinobi that shoot grenades using their bows, and entire artillery companies. &gt;The original American Continental Marines were an army of Japanese Ronin Samurai mercenaries. &gt;If you throw a lot of torches into a building, it will not burn. However, it will break apart and then finally explode. &gt;Native American fire pit dances generate magic that they put to use in battle, putting Warcraft spellcasters to shame. &gt;Medicine men, surgeons, and priests all perform the same healing magic. &gt;Even standing near an idle monster truck could be lethal. &gt;Even before the creation of the United States, George Washington always knew heâ€™d end up on both the quarter and the dollar bill. &gt;As an Asian power, you can ally with your enemy through the consulateâ€¦ and still wage war with their forces with soldiers from their own home country. &gt;Chinese flamethrowers never burn anything, they just kill it and blow it up. &gt;The British employed the use of longbowmen well into the 1800s. &gt;Cuauhtemoc of the Aztecs is a cool guy; he has a blood fetish and refers to himself in third person. &gt;Queen Isabella so desperate, sheâ€™ll sleep with Cuauhtemoc &gt;Akbar of the Indians is worse than a fervent Jehovahâ€™s Mormon as he constantly attempts to convert you to his religion (Hinduism) while beating him up. On the bright side, he canâ€™t nuke you like Gandhi. &gt;Russian strelets are a gift from the Aztec blood gods. &gt;Russian strelets are equipped with large foam axes and airsoft muskets. &gt;Created an Iroquois home city called Toronto, named the warchief Rob Ford. He smoked crack, befriended blowgunners and blew up his own city. &gt;As another reviewer simply noted, you can beat up monkeys and steal their money. &gt;The Haitians hoped that their new ironclad warships would be their knights in shining armor. They turned out to be their morons in aluminum foil. &gt;The story of the original Thanksgiving is full of lies, propagated by the capitalist pigs in Washington. The true story goes as follows. In 1603, Shogun Tokugawa wanted to construct a new shogunate palace. He sent a group of Japanese pilgrims across the ocean. A few years later, they landed on Plymouth in New England, an excellent place for a new shogunate palace. There, they befriended a native scout and his pet intrepid scout turkey. Shortly thereafter, a group of allied Chinese pilgrims came ashore and set up shop alongside them. The Japanese and Chinese came together for a great turkey dinner. HOWEVERâ€¦ The French and the Ottomans landed around the same time and did not take kindly to what they saw as encroachment upon their lands. A great war ensued in which the Chinese and Japanese ultimately prevailed. In the end, a great Thanksgiving feast was held in the new shogunate palace with Tokugawa as the host.  &gt;SPECIAL EDIT: Indestructable outposts  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZbC69DS_D0   Civilizations: &gt;You can beat up the British and steal their tea. &gt;You can beat up the French and steal their military victories. &gt;You can beat up the Dutch and steal their tulips. &gt;You can beat up the Portuguese and steal their secret liquor. &gt;You can beat up the Spanish and steal their dogs. &gt;You can beat up the Germans and steal their beer. &gt;You can beat up the Ottoman Turks and steal their turkey. &gt;You can beat up the Russians and steal their vodka. &gt;You can beat up the Iroquois and steal Hiawathaâ€™s poetry. &gt;You can beat up the Sioux and steal Gallâ€™s gallbladder.  &gt;You can beat up the Aztecs and steal their bottled blood. &gt;You can play as the Japanese and steal your alliesâ€™ food. &gt;You can beat up the Chinese and steal their many inventions and claim them as your own. &gt;You can beat up the Indians and steal their elephants and then beat up their sacred cows.  Campaigns: The campaigns of the base game and The Warchiefs expansion provide an interesting story that follows the Blacks, a family of mostly brutal dark magic thieves. They can create entire armies and civilizations that a can appear and disappear within an hour. However, they end up being known and portrayed as heroes as they more often than not beat up bad guys and steal their stuff. The Asian Dynasties have similar stories but are completely unrelated to the Black Family.  Blood â€“ As Morgan Black, &gt;Beat up the Ottomans and steal their cannons. &gt;Beat up pirates and steal their maps. &gt;Beat up the Spanish and steal their money. &gt;Beat up the Knightâ€™s Templar and steal their water.  Ice â€“ As John Black, &gt;Mock your uncle Stuartâ€™s lack of masculinity despite the fact that he packs the most powerful right hook punch in the entire New World. &gt;Beat up the Cherokee and steal their cannons. &gt;Beat up the rogue British and steal back your damsel-in-distress girlfriend Nonahkee. &gt;Pursue a rogue British general across North America with a fleet of monster trucks. &gt;Finally, blow yourself up and prevent the Knightâ€™s Templar from leading a Russian invasion of America.  Fire â€“ As Nathaniel Black, &gt;Beat up the British and steal their colonies. &gt;Beat up the Hessians and steal back your damsel-in-distress mother Nonahkee. &gt;Win the Revolutionary War with giant stone busts of George Washington that crush and trample entire armies.  &gt;Level the British forts at Yorktown with these colonial titans while they proclaim, â€œCheck in your wallet. Thatâ€™s me on the dollar bill.â€  Steel â€“ As Amelia Black, &gt;Beat up rival companies and steal their railroads. &gt;Beat up the Sioux and steal their land. &gt;Beat up the Knightâ€™s Templar and steal their money.  Shadow â€“ As Chayton Black, &gt;Beat up the Sioux again and steal their land. &gt;Beat up a Civil War veteran and steal his money. &gt;Beat up General George Armstrong Custer and steal his mullet.  (Asian Dynasties) Japan â€“ As General Kinchiro (Batman), &gt;Beat up Japanese daimyos and steal their land. &gt;Note: The Japanese can run mid-19th century steam trains in the early-17th century.  China â€“ As Captain Huang,  &gt;Beat up pirates, Indians, and Aztecs with your shirtless partner Lao Chen, and then completely cover up your presence.  India â€“ As a sepoy named Nabir, &gt;Beat up your own countrymen and steal everything they have. &gt;Shoot your commanding officerâ€™s bodyguard and just walk away. &gt;Beat up the British and steal their saltpeter. &gt;Beat up the British and steal back your elephants.  11/10. If you donâ€™t have the money to buy this game, beat up someone and steal their money.
17	1	a	Worthy of any RTS fans collection! Good classic strategic combat, well balanced against your building and resource management.  Although older game now it has held up well and also retains an active community.  Good multiplayer and extensive campaigns to play.

21	1	a	All the feels are comming back when i played this game 8 years ago . I loved it so much i have two copies cd and steam, you can not go wrong if you puchase this game   10/10
23	1	a	Still better than  Age of Empires 2 .  Strike one for imperialism.  Looks nice, sounds nice, cannons are a great feature, has a working online service, trading cards, steam hours counting, *breathes*, all the DLC you might have missed in the old days, great 3-tiered base campaign which follows a families lineage.   Takes place in the times of exploration, which is a nice departure from ancient times.  The simplification of some game features were hit or miss, some were niceties, others just are too simple. An example of one that was a miss was the removal of individual farm squares, and collection buildings, although it can be assumed that it is automated, it still seems too simple.  Has a nice variety of units, although, the crossbowmen seem kind of weaksauce when I got Janissaries with guns and cannons so big they can be used for artillery. Its let hack and slash, blow for blow of some other strategy games, and more so the style of 'you mess up, you just might die'.  Price is a little on the high side however, and if you can get it cheaper than $40, I would whole heartidly recommend it.
25	1	a	you can beat monkeys to death and steal their money
27	1	a	You can force women to mine gold 10/10 would reverse gender roles again
29	1	a	Great game, but I cannot justify recommending to friends to pay $40 USD for this game when its literally over 10 years old. Get it when its on special
31	1	a	Though many people say AOE2 is the best in the franchise, I actually think AOE3, with the abundance of exotic civs from 2 expansions and unofficial mods, has surpassed that timeless classic.  Graphics: AOE3 looks great at distance, even up to today's standards. That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.  Sound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.  Gameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.  Mods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2.   Community: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.  Conclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.
33	1	a	we want Age of Empires 4!!!
35	1	a	My opinion on every AOE is almost the same. I absolutely love these types of games. I enjoy building and training a growing army then completely smashing everyone else (unless they are better than me huhuhuhu) but honestly AOE III is a bit graphic outdated now but itâ€™s still an amazing game for it being released in 2005.   Recommendation: Absolutely. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and won't mind a bit less graphics then the newer games.
37	1	a	Age of Empires III is criticized for being not a good follow-up to AoE II. I don't fully understand the criticism. I prefer the colonial-era setting of AoE III much more than the medieval one of II. The skirmish mode of AoE III results in roughly 45-75 minute games, which is great for short bursts of gaming. It's a great way to unwind and is an engaging game that has stood the test of time.
39	1	a	I own two coppies of AOE3, that's just how great of a game it is. Between my retail copy and my steam copy I'd have nearly 1000 hours played. Positives: 'Card Deck Tech Tree' Allows you to select up to 35 technologies that are unlocked based on your XP in the match. The abillity to name your Explorer and Homecity. City leveling and user leveling adds noticeable multiplayer progression. Tradepost [specified spots on the map allow you to build a tradepost for extra resources, units and technologies offering a bit of a King Of The HIll feel]. Negatives: No diplomacy [unless a custom scenario], only 3 team options [FFA, 1 or 2], no capturing enemy units/technologies [in previous games you could use your priest/monk to convert enemies to your team].
41	1	a	Thumbs Up For Workshop!!
43	1	a	Age of Empires 3  Genre: Strategy - Real Time Strategy Rating: 10/10 Personal playing period: 5+ years Is it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy players collection. Girl vs Game: Unless it's some super model I'd definately rather play the Game.  Personal Comment: This is an amazing game with endless amounts of game time. The hours on here isnt a fraction of my actual game time online and offline. Been playing this game since the day it was released and still play it and love it today. I even missed a couple of meals as well as toilet breaks playing this believe it or not. I have bladder and bowel control of a ninja thanks to AOE.  Online gaming: The online gaming community is still very active and people of all skill levels are on it. You will find anywhere between 500 to 2000 people online at any given time. Beware though that even though AOE is helpful and awesome the online community are sometimes a bunch of cocktonsil nimrod supremists who think they're amazing whilst never having seen or felt a girl up close unless in a magazine. But if your skin is thick and you dont give a flying **** about other people you'll be fine.  Short Summary: This is a real time strategy game that plays off in the medieval times. There are 8 standard civilizations, 3 native indian civilizations and 3 Asian civilizations. Each civ provides a different set of advantages and it takes time to learn how to utilise the various civs to their full capability. Learning each civilisation takes time and it is great fun doing that. There are countless amounts of maps that allow for the use of different strategies. The game also has a story rich single player campaign. I have not played the campaign yet but never felt the need to as the standard game modes offer more than enough fun and game time. The game also has progressive improvement meaning the more you play the more items get unlocked and the stronger your civilisation becomes. This ensures that you want to play more and more in order to improve the strength of your favourite civilisation.  Learning Curve and Gameplay: Easy to start but tough to master. The learning curve to start playing and learning the basics is very easy. Learning the various civilisations and their strengths is more challenging and may take a lot of practice and time. The gameplay is very simplistic in it being a basic RTS with click and place. Gathering of basic resources and using those resources are easy and self explanotary. A tutorial can be played to understand the basics but this game is very playable and a new player will get it after playing only for a few hours.
45	1	a	Old but amazing!  Still an awesome game and addictive playing multiplayer. Highly recommend this if you're into real time strategy games.
47	1	a	A game from back when RTS games were still riding high, when 'base building' wasn't a dirty word and factions were meant to be colourful and fun. It shows its age now, but the core mechanics are still solid.  An unusual characteristic of an RTS was persistency; or how your play affected you in the next game. AOE III had experience gain over time that would unlock 'cards', which then could be called into play in a future match. This also came with nice cosmetic upgrades for a 'capital' city, which let players really feel that they were leading an army into battle. Sadly these cosmetic upgrades were not in place for Asian or American civilizations in the expansions, although the persistant card unlocks are still present.  The factions are nicely done. The European factions all largely play the same, with some emphasis on artillery, cavalry, or infantry between them. Asian civilizations are also fairly similar, just implementing 'wonders' as well as other minor changes. I do like the emphasis on the Americans, who end up playing much more differently as they lack the hard defenses that others do. Overall these different factions make for a high level of replayability.  An old game, but worth the money. Especially since newer quality RTSs are infrequent.
49	1	a	PLease make another! AOE 4
51	1	a	Started playing back in about 2005. Log in and win a couple every couple years now. Always a classic. By far my favorite game ever.
53	1	a	Remember when the Chinese fought the Russians in the Caribbean? How about when they built entire villages in Texas and defended against Germany?   Historical accuracy is on point.
55	1	a	This game very amazing. Hoping that they will make Age of Empires IV!
57	1	a	A follow up to the 2'nd Age of Empires that everyone loved.   Among many this game is not so good, some things were simplified, such as gathering resources - now there are 3 instead of 4 of them and your villagers don't have to come back to the lumberjack or the city centre to store them.  Many smaller tweaks and adjustments, and of course a heavy focus on musket fights, artillery and the transition from Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution and father away into the 19'th Century.   It's a shame that there weren't any additional elements added to the Steam release of the game.  Controls being one of the more touchy ones. For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud, but they did add Trading Cards so that's one interesting thing to look forward to.  This game is soon to have 10 years after it's release. But this edition is by far the best one yet. You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as 'one of the best'.   The modest presentation of it's ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EWfMfHlFck&amp;list=PL37F10A7ECDC81CA0&amp;index=9   A Musical score composed by Ensemble Studios musicians Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan.   If History is of any interest to you, if the New World conquests were something you're keen on. Buy this game, especially when on sale!
59	1	a	Good points of Age of Empires III:  Good unit diversity: Each civ has a core of units semi-unique to them, making each one feel different enough that playing the Germans doesn't feel like a playing a reskin of the British, or vice versa. For the 'European Civs' (I put that in quotes because while the Ottoman Turks are not from Europe at all, they play like one of the other European civs), that diversity is actually rather subtle, with each civ having one or two units totally unique to them, as well as a couple semi-universal units that are their 'Best Units', which get special high-tier upgrades. For example, while the Spanish get Hussars, like the British, the British can upgrade them to 'Kingsguard' Hussars, while the Spanish just get regular 'Guard' Hussars. The distinction is rather intuitive; basically, if a unit gets a special name once it hits its second upgrade, it'll be better in some way than a unit that doesn't. In this way, the European civs harken back, somewhat, to Age of Empires II, which had each civ only have one or two unique units. On the other hand, each of the Native American and Asian civs are completely different, with entirely different units and even different mechanics, and which units each civ is best with is fairly obvious a few minutes into playing them. The diversity is further enhanced with mercenary units available from the home city and native american units from trading posts.  Good story campaigns: I can't quite make this point without clarification. The first three campaigns were not that great. Those were the pre-expansion ones, and frankly, the series had really stopped working out those storytelling muscles it had in Age of Empires II. The action often felt disjointed and rushed, with the endings of each of the three campaigns being the only bits that seemed to matter or have any impact. However, all of that said, the latter five campaigns were actually quite good, especially if you could disengage them from the taint of their predecessors in terms of tropes and pacing. In addition, the characters personal struggles in the latter five campaigns were more apparent, their inner struggles seemed to mean so much more. Really, if you want a great story, the latter five campaigns are pretty damn good.  Good* Mechanics: This game has some rather... mixed mechanics. I'll get to the bad later, but for now, the good news! The home city is the big thing that was touted on release, and frankly, I like the concept a lot. It allows a player to gain advantages specific to their strategy, whether it be resource gathering, naval dominance, or raw military power. Essentially, the way the Home City works is that the player assigns cards to a deck, each card representing a batch of units or an upgrade or some resources. When a home city shipment is available in game, the player selects one of the cards they've assigned, and after a brief waiting period (Hey, it takes time to get a Declaration to Claim the New World overseas. Cut them some slack.), the units, tech, etc. arrives. In addition to this as one of the primary mechanics, you've got your normal suite of resource gathering (done with villager-type units) and military unit production. An interesting nuance of the unit production here is that when you've got a military building selected, let's say, the Barracks, and let's say you want to train a sqaud of Musketeers. You can shift-click the unit portrait to train five at once. While this may not seem novel by itself; a few games already allow this sort of thing, the novel thing is that doing it this way makes the waiting period for your units slightly longer, but you get all five units at once. The Russians and Chinese have this as their primary mechanic, with the Russians training 'blocks' of infantry, and the Chinese creating 'Banner Armies' which are groups of various unit combinations. Overall, the mechanics are decent in most respects. In addition, the game very cleverly and subtley hampers rushing, which was a brutal, and often severely effective tactic in Age of Empires II, by making it so that the player cannot send units from the home city, or even train them, until the second technological era. I hardly ever notice that my efforts at building an army are being hampered by this restriction, but when I do notice it, I am appreciative of the clever design choice.  Bad points of Age of Empires III:  Bad* Mechanics: As I said, this game has some mixed mechanics. Now we come to the bad. The primary problem we have here is that while the home city, is in concept, a nice idea with some potential for strategic use, it seems best used as a rush enabler. Earlier, I mentioned that the game restricts rushing by limiting military units to the second age and following. But the home city can easily be stocked with military unit shipments so that come second era, you can get an entire army, virtually free of charge. Here's a hot tip for those cheese players out there: Get the best second-era military unit shipments you can. Then, in game, save up your shipments. Once you get to age II, build a Church. Then research Mercantilism, which gets you around 3 shipments for 1,000 Coin. Then, in essence, spawn a horde of troops. Admittedly, this really only works for the European civs, but the overwhelming potential for early-midgame rush is still somewhat staggering, and it means that some of the more interesting home city shipments may not ever see play. In addition, many games, it seems, are decided well before the final technological era. The reasons for this are two-fold: A) Reaching that final era and researching all the upgrades is simply prohibitively expensive, and B) It just makes more sense to strike your enemy before then, fatally, if possible. This makes the late-game content feel a little unnecessary, as you're probably already winning if you can research that final era, and if you're not winning, spending 4,000 food and coin isn't going to make things that much better. The game does mitigate this somewhat, by having a 'Revolution' feature, an alternative to the final age-up, which turns all your villager-type units into militia-type units, and also gives you a plethora of new military options for your civ. However, if you're far ahead enough that you can forgo economy entirely, than you probably don't need the feature anyway. Also, it's only available to European civs, so the final age cost problem is still relevant to Asian and Native American civs. Also, unit counters and stats can be difficult to wrap one's head around, as the developers saw fit to give the player the literal math used to determine unit stats. For example, I believe the movement speed for the average footsoldier was 7.25. Not 7, not 8, but a fraction, 7.25. While this may not seem like a major issue, throwing numbers like that at a player makes the game feel less than polished, and also degrades the meaning of the numbers themselves. 7.25 what? And what does it mean when my Musketeer deals 8 damage, but the Hussar it's attacking has 0.20 armor? Does it deflect 0.20 damage? Or 20% damage? The game doesn't tell you, meaning you'll have to examine the numbers closely to determine exact impact of your units against your opponents.  Anachronism: While I will be the first to admit that anachronism in a strategy game isn't that huge an issue, and is in fact, almost to be expected in these kinds of games, the situation here is rather glaring. Granted, the problem is bigger in the first three story campaigns, and I wouldn't mind it quite so much if it were restricted to the game itself only. But c'mon. Having Revolutionary War era musketeers accompany Amelia Black, a railroad owner? And having them in full garb in cutscene? That's the sort of thing that stretches disbelief to the breaking point, and was one of the reasons that those campaigns did not match the quality of the latter five.  Overall Review: It's pretty good. Steam's char. limits are â™¥â™¥â™¥.
61	1	a	The game gives rather different experience than Age of Empires II, it's much more faster paced, the natural resources are limited, but you can get farms, plantiations and factories that produces them in unlimited amount. Also, you can capture trade outposts that allow you to get more experience needed for shipment's (which give additional units, resources or upgrades for your nation). Which those changes you are able to fight for longer, have bigger battles and in exchange - have more fun.  The unit combat is really sweet and enjoyable, mixing various types of units gives an edge in the battle, which means that spam blobs can be easily defeated if played right. The game is well balanced, even with weakest nation you are able to defeat any other nation, and if meele combat is your kink, you can have a lot of fun here.  The only con is that camera position is really really close to your units, and you can change it just by a little bit, which might be irritating, and when you alt+tab the sound options reset's so you have to change them again. Also, there is a lot of problems with multiplayer if you want to play via lan, which I still didnt figured out.
63	1	a	  Drowning in nostalgia
65	1	a	I think this is the best game in the series and the exapansions are very good, still plays and feels amazing in 2015, and i love the online play.
67	1	a	story time, me and my brother got this game and with no prior knowledge decided to 1v1. after about 30 mins of fighting he sails to my base and proceeds to destroy it with highly superior troops. but since the gamemode we were playing on required you to destoy everything your opponent owns there was an awkward moment while we wondered why he had not won. Turns out i had a lone settler chopping wood who had been doing that the entire game, after taking control of this settler i started a wild goose chase which ended with my settler hiding behind 3 low level outpost awaiting his doom at the hands of hundreds of enemy soldiers  10/10
69	1	a	I'm pretty sure I have played more then 2000+ on the disc version so trust me, its definitly worth the price ^^
71	1	a	Online play is toxic, but fun. Camapaign is fine. Great for LAN parties if that's even still a thing.
73	1	a	Already better than no mans sky.
75	1	a	Long time AOE fan. This is my favorite of the series, because they took out so much of the tedious micro managing out of the game. The cards 'shipments' is a fun aspect too. Awesome multiplayer. My fav. strategy game ever.
77	1	a	bought it for nostalgia reasons and you know what? NO REGRETS THIS GAME IS AS EPIC AND FUN AS IT USED TO BE!
79	1	a	ÃŽ am Portuguese and of course I choose the Portuguese empire! I sailed to south america and I invade their lands! I killed them, I stole their resources(land, food, gold and wood)! And after been proud of the things I did, I build a new civilization called Brazil.   Review: 10/10 Very realistic!
81	1	a	I've been playing these titles since they were released during the late 90s. The soundtrack is pretty relaxing and enjoyable. The Game is just epic, i am happy that the game's had being released on steam.  If you dont own or have this epic, this is a must buy game.
83	1	a	Childhood Relived
85	1	a	I highly recommend buying this game. The community for this game is great and has quite many players for a 9 year old game. I'm the leader of the clan TLDT and if you want to join just whisper me on eso. TLDT has over 100 members, a clan website and regular clan events.
87	1	a	Brilliant Game. Brilliant Bundle. Played 3 through my childhood before I had steam and now I have this collection I have once again logged many hours on this awesome game!
89	1	a	Do I recommend this game? I do. I really do.  It's like masterpiece of music or artwork. You can make beautiful colonies, great armies and great battles. It's not about accuracy, but about tactic, strategy. You need to get resources as fast as possible, get units and destroy your enemy. Simple, but hard, since different nation has different bonuses. So far I loved France and Portugal. France for unique settlers, which are strong and gather faster than usual settlers. Voltigeurs and Gandarmes are strong together. Advanced formation for Gandarmes recommended. (able to turn on in gameplay options)  Portugal is... just beautiful. I love the language and voices they have. Cassadores are powerful long-range units with cute voice. Organ guns are ideal against infantry. Jinetes (dragoons) are hardcore enemies for cavarly, so use 'em to keep your artillery safe from enemy's horses. There maybe hard choice for pikemen or halbardies, but imo pikemen are way more useful, even if weaker. I work with 45 Cassadores and 5 Heavy Cannons (also +1 for voice) which are powerful formation, but also weak. So I used to work with weaker (low hp) units, but faster and more powerful. Rathauses (or how do you call it) are a bit annoying, since if you want to build beautiful looking colony, 3 rathauses are enough imo.  Even tho price may not be very convincing, spend money on this (or wait for sale, it's always an option) and have fun. Company is fun either.
91	1	a	Pros : This is absolutely a fun strategy time-sink. Many hours haven't even been logged on Steam for my current account due to owning two accounts with AoE3 on it. Since good RTS seem limited to Starcraft and Warcraft, I like more realism and history than a fantasy universe. The art and graphics (if that is your main focus) are beautiful. Units work create formations which I have always enjoyed in a RTS. Gathering materials is pretty basic, wood, gold, food, and balancing everything is not too stressful which is great for any strategy game. I also enjoy the way the different difficulties are set. Easy being easy enough to learn and still win and Normal seeming challenging. There is a sandbox mode which is great for people learning the game as well and dont wish to focus on combat.  For single player, Age of Empires 3 has a genius combination of history, customization, and RTS. I make myself sick of this game and even if I stop for a few months I WILL be back.  Cons (without bias) : Let me start with the warning alert. Over and over you will hear this as long as you are being attacked and not watching that area. It causes me to mute my game when there are multiple battles. Not fun. It seem frusturating laggy during combat and this is because of units being in formation. Getting used to a combination of different unit speeds makes you break up your selection. Being that realistic is not fun to a lot of people. Single player doesn't hold your hand during the 'tutorial' portion. They expect you to know a bit about RTS already. The ships are terrible in huge groups which they make up for in speed. This is for both you and the enemy so it may seem that they pop up on you very quickly.
93	1	a	Civ games seem so slow and boring compared to this game 10/10.
95	1	a	Its different from the AOE 1 &amp; 2 style , with more choices , rpg like , enhanced better graphics etc.  -Story is awesome if you will choose to play campaign , 3 stories , each one is better than another. -The difficulty with this one is reasonable , i mean unlike AOE 1 &amp; 2 campaigns , you have to be so pro to finish them without cheats , this one will let you finish the campaign with no cheats. -The purchasing unit in this game is intersting , saves alot of time than previous AOE's , for example you could build 5 units in 1 queue instead of 1 by 1 , theres also town supplies that you can get them every 4 mins ~ ( you get to choose ur cargo and set up before starting game ). -This type of games aint about graphics i know , but this game's graphics are fairly nice and pleaseing to see. -When you're done with the main story , you could still play customized battles , as you will gain experince that will allow you to level up ur own town , with way more more cards/choices/upgrades than you had in story mode.   Either you're going to play it alone or with friends , its so much fun. i'd recommend buying this game in full/sale prices , worth it anyway. 9.5/10.
97	1	a	Not as good as its predecessor, but still a good game. The AI is a little wonky, and if you know a few tricks it's easy to use some sneaky tactics to beat the computer, even on the hardest settings. Would definitely reccomend this game if you are just starting to play RTS games and want something a little more forgiving than Starcraft or AoE2.
99	1	a	Probably played over 2000 hours on this combined with my disc copy. When's AOE4, yeah?
101	1	a	Would recommend this game and the entire series to anyone! Great stuff, from the first game to the last.
103	1	a	Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that itâ€™s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But itâ€™s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.   At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the gameâ€™s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your â™¥â™¥â™¥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.   Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3â€™s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Iâ€™m stuck on one mission that I simply canâ€™t seem to complete.)  However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.  Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Iâ€™m sure there are so many others that I havenâ€™t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.  In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.   Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.   (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)
105	1	a	I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D
107	1	a	Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have.  But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.  Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations.   Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)  If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!  I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.   READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.
109	1	a	After some 1,400 hours on the game, I can say with FULL VALIDITY this game has ruined my life. If you like realistic physics, teamwork, and every form of warfare, this game is for you. 10/10
111	1	a	I wanna play a Zombie game! (U can) I wanna play a realistic game! (U can) I wanna fly a plane! (U can) I wanna fly a Helicopter! (U can) I wanna drive a tank! (U can) I wanna drive a car!

113	1	a	This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign.   Crowd around, children, it's story time.  One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.  The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his 'clan'.  I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.  This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.  My new friend was dead.  10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.
115	1	a	I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.  Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.  You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.  You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.  The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.  I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.
117	1	a	 â”œProfessors Reviewâ”¤
119	1	a	Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.  Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.
121	1	a	The only game i'll happily play at 5 fps.
123	1	a	 For all the haters out there; Arma 3 does not have glitches or bugs, they are called features and we  love  them.
125	1	a	Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: '$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!' Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.  Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator   and   a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).   The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.   Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.  I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched 'tappy' sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.  Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.  So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D
127	1	a	You can go through one whole hour of combat, with bullets blazing, without managing to spot a single enemy nor shoot a single shot. Hands down the best combat simulator there is.
129	1	a	The best and one of the kind military simulator, with unprecedented tactical depth and wide array of additional features, like:  - Accurate ballistics &amp; penetration simulation  - Good range of vehicles to choose from  - No 'story rails' and total freedom of choice in sandbox environment  - Barely surpassed weapons/gear customization  - Greatest community out there with quality mods/addons Worth its cost on 300%
131	1	a	I played Altis Life and a cop arrested me because I said I was black. 10/10 so realistic.
133	1	a	This game is the reason my girlfriend of four years and I broke up.  I do not regret a thing.
135	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
137	1	a	I got PTSD from this game.         In the most immersive way possible.
139	1	a	The only game where another person on the other end of the mic makes you do push ups irl.
141	1	a	Arma 3 has taught me that 10 FPS is playable.
143	1	a	when you begin: you will get rekt. you will forget what keys to use. you will try to quickscope. you will try to kill teammates. you will create a character with outfits that make absolutely no sense but you won't even know. you will try to spot enemies. you will try to charge in on your own. you will try to change the buttons but you will most likely fail. you will get banned for no reason.  but remember, it will be worth it because you're gonna turn into a fine warrior.
145	1	a	It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not...  I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I had no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions.  It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful.  10/10
147	1	a	Brilliant Military Sim sandbox. Like simulators? Like Military Shooters? Like Sanbox games that encourage mods and community content?  If yes, you should already own this.
149	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
151	1	a	Just look at home many hours I have spent in this game... NUFF SAID!
153	1	a	A brilliant simulator beyond words.  Drop your CoD console controllers and get in here.   Nobody will call you a 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' or a 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' or threaten to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your mother.  In here - we are all in it together, equally worthless and equally ambitious ;)  \m/

159	1	a	I was talking to a guy in a courtyard and a helicopter squished him. So I stole his gear.  10/10
161	1	a	Was about to log out before I watched a man named 'john' play 'In the arms of an angel' while planes were falling around him before eventually killing him.  11/10 for feels, please get this game, for me, for john.
163	1	a	With 70 hours, I can safely say this game is definetly worth the money. It caters to all types of players. Casual players can usually find themselves playing custom missions such as Wasteland and King of the Hill. Roleplaying players have Stratis and Altis life, and tactical players can find servers with Coop and Team vs Team missions as well as tactical groups that play the game in a very realistic manner. Besides the vanilla content there is a variety of realism and fun mods both in the workshop and from outside resources. Feel free to do your own research, check out the Zeus game mode, as well as some tactical gameplay videos that can usually be found  https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi .  tl;dr Game is awesome, very moddable, hours of gameplay.  Edit: Just to update the review, now with a lot more hours and proper tactical gaming experience behind me, I can say I rediscovered arma completely. In my first mission I didn't even fire the gun and it was more fun than most of the stuff I have played before. Now, this type of 'tactical' gameplay might not suit everyone so if you feel like it, give it a shot, if not, go back to the rest of the fun stuff.
165	1	a	Kids play Call Of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play Arma
167	1	a	I ran a marathon without leaving my chair.  11/10
169	1	a	Why is this game still 60 bucks it came out 2 years ago.
171	1	a	So..you're here to possibly buy Arma 3..I was in that position before, I just bought it when it was 50% off.  Here's a checklist for you:  Do you like Call of Duty? Can you 360 no scope in CoD? Do you like 9 year olds screaming on the mic?  If you answered yes to those then this game is NOT for you.  Do you like CS:GO? Are you a pro AWPer in CS:GO?  Well if you answered yes this game will rip you apart and you will be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sniper.  Do you like simulators? Do you like military games? Are you up for the challenge? Do you want an alternative to joining the military in real life? Do you have at least $30?  If so, then you are ready for this challenge.  --------------  Pros:  MASSIVE REALISTIC COMBAT servers with 100+ people  Few 'squeakers' on mics  Steam Workshop  Many players still today.  Single player Modes  Tutorials, and all kinds of training for practice.  --------------------- Cons:  $60 pricey, but worth more than any call of duty game.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AI - It's ok, playable.  Lag - This game is apparently heavily dependent on CPU in huge multiplayer games your fps can drop from over 9000 to 20 in a matter of seconds.  Glitches  Bugs  When people shoot from far away it sounds like BB guns.  Trolls in multiplayer - they can steal your helicopters and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you buy or just be a pilot and kamikazi with you in it.  Doesn't come with cookies. 
173	1	a	Decide to play Arma 3. Log into Exile Server Start Driving with American Friends, with one Brit in the car Sun starts coming up Tell Driver to pull over All the Americans step out We line up outside of the Ifrit Every American salutes the sun rise Give 21 gun salute Brit sits awkwardly in car  20/10 Would be Patriotic as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again
175	1	a	I thought I would put this out there during the Christmas sale.  You have no better time than now to buy this game. For the price of the Apex expansion alone, you can get Arma 3, Apex expansion, and the DLC bundle. $70 worth of content for $35. From the 3 hours I have played, it is worth it.  If you're considering Arma 3, definitely consider it NOW during the sale.  I'll write a proper review of this game once I put in a few more hours. I've only experienced single player so far.
177	1	a	'Get off side chat' 10/10
179	1	a	Spent 1hr crawling through woodland to get to the perfect sniping point and then accidentally threw a grenade killing me and my spotter.  10/10
181	1	a	&gt;Bought a server online. &gt;Placed server in basement and turns it on. &gt;Play two hours of arma altis life with friends and one random dude. &gt;Give all friends including random dude admin powers. &gt;Leave server on so they can play. &gt;Forget about friends/server for six months due to life. &gt;Log back on PC after six months. &gt;3,600 emails... &gt;Random dude started Altis life community that gets 100+ people a day with people I don't know. &gt;Message random dude. &gt; Says he made this for me and gave me 10% of donations. &gt;I am happy. &gt;Tell him to keep it up. &gt;Forget again for another six months due to life. &gt; Find server under fourteen boxes of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and turn my pc back on because I want to play again. &gt; Join server, no admin powers, get confused, call admin, he doesn't believe me, ask for random dude: He bans me. &gt; Tell random dude what happened; He tells admin what he just did; admin says hes' sorry. &gt;Log off. &gt;Join next day. &gt; Still no admin powers; start playing normally. &gt; Man says he has 600 million in his bank acount while he is mugging a helpless newby. &gt; Getangry.jpg &gt; Goes on server forums saying: SERVER WIPE COMING THIS THURSDAY. &gt; Mass panic. &gt; Random dude says to stop. &gt; I say its my server, my rules. &gt;Don't restart. &gt;Continue to mess with people on the server by deleting all their money because they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. My profile picture pretty much is random dude's face when I banned him for taking 90% donations.   This is my only experience of arma etc the campaign.  I like it.   
183	1	a	I rarely rate a game this high, but this one is a perfect 10/10 for the genre it represents vs. any competitive products out there.  Bar none, the BEST military simulation on the PC that is available to the public and priced under $10000  Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic, there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic, etc, etc, etc. However, there are no other games that combine ALL the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.  Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series, which started out as 'Operation Flashpoint 1985'. OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and the Arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created OPF1985.  With a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor, mods, mods, and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games.  If you want the same feature set, but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars. But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.  If you want to enjoy this, but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC, then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this, get Arma II.
185	1	a	Hard not to be overly fanboiÂ´ish or hateful on this iteration of the game.   My best advice: DonÂ´t believe the pictures. Read up on the game first. And itÂ´s not a casual shooter.
187	1	a	You can run through the battlefield in just your underwear.   10/10

197	1	a	I broke up with my girlfriend because of Arma.  t-thanks b-bohemia..
199	1	a	This is one of the only games where I can be playing at sub 25 FPS and still have fun.
201	1	a	i think ive finnished learning the controls ill update once i play.
203	1	a	Where the Battlefield series should have naturally progressed to; a huge multi-faceted, vehicle crammed blood bath with a fantastic community (for the most part). Thankfully this beat Battlefield to it so we don't have to deal with EA to play!
205	1	a	Still haven't beaten the campaign.
207	1	a	ARMA 3 Multiplayer review 10/10 So my first day on ARMA&lt;3 3. I was born. I rolled out the spawn point. Before I even got out spawn the was a hive of activity from people running around shouting profanities in ever language you can think of. From the kid running down the road after his car that been robbed by three guys who are now flipping the kid the middle finger as the kids is chasing them down the road shouting in his high pitched voice â€œ GIVE ME MY CAR BACK YOU F&amp;%$%â€. Then the is that guy all geared up looking like he just came from a game off battlefield 4 who is selling his expert military killing skills to you for a one time low price â€œ protection to hits all under ones roof, you a fresh you should hire me I would give ya some tipsâ€ he shouts in a menacing voice at you. Donâ€™t forget the fresh spawns running around trolling people, lying in front of their cars stopping them from driving off, to the five guys surrounding the only cop in the place shouting at the top of their voiceâ€™s â€œ we are protesting against the police force you are corruptâ€ I could hardly take it all in when a Dutch guy walks up to me and says â€œhi dude how are you?â€  I replied â€œim cool just looking to get $hit rolling, you know?â€ the Dutch guy say to me in a very mellow voice, very very mellow voice â€œ yar come with me brudda I got two friends we going to make some money you wan in?â€ Without a thought I now found myself in a car with three guys who are all not talking even when I ask them where we going. we head down the road at speed, before long we are in a field with the guys now out the car pointing guns at me all shouting at the top of the voices â€œget out the F$Â£%% car now!â€ intermediated and curious at the same time I get out the car. To find one of them smashing me over the head with his pistol in a rocky balboa of a swing witch sends me crashing to the floor. Now the three bandits have me on the floor and are now proceeding to hit me over and over again to keep me there, they ask me for one million dollars. I laugh at them and tell them im fresh to this hold thing I have no money. They chat around to around for a minute then they tell me that I have wasted there time and im going to have to payâ€¦  They then opened fire on me and I was killed.  Spawn back in where the guy with the menacing voice runs up to me and says â€œdonâ€™t get in cars with strangers, that one is on the houseâ€ as he walks off in to the long dusty road of Role Play. I ended up making a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ load of friends on the sever, it was great Altis life. Joined a clan steam rolled through the clan and became warlords in our own rights. Zeus the clan ran the sever we had our fat fingers in all the pies. Not a lot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed with us but if they did we would pull such a force together with ours members and our allies, no one could escape. Robbing banks, robbing players homes, robbing players, taking hostages for ransom if no pay out shot the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er and make a carpet out of him, drug dealing, drug farming, drug taking knocking off drug dealers and farmers the lot. It was like my very own Scarface.  Military Simulator Game ARAM&lt;3 Is an awesome game, brilliant combat simulation with breathtaking graphics and terrain. The standard maps are based on two real islands in the Mediterranean sea in Greece. The maps are identical to the real islands. The game developers went to that much length to map the terrain that they got arrested by the Greek authorities for spying, thatâ€™s commitment. The Incredible scale of Altis the main island is over 270 kilometers, it has 730klm of road linking 50 towns, villages, and cities. Accurate star map for navigation.  The islands have five unique factions, NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA and the civilians each have their own motives and vehicles. Over 15 stances, now remember your keys you donâ€™t want to get stuck in one of them. The moding is great on this the are tones of mods out there for you where its game type to gun grips and that AK47 you always wanted. The multiplayer and the moding community work well together. But I find the game modes and vanilla content good as well. Breaking point and arma life, wasteland chernus (cherno map for arma2 dayz mod) are but a couple of mods you should check out. The list goes on. The is so much i could say more about this game but that list goes on too. I give this the best marks i can.
209	1	a	  This was my Christmas gift from my best friend on steam, And we had both hell of alot of fun at it. Made new friends while playing it, and learned alot more about Military tactics and procedures.   Pros: Full real sized open world map of a real greek island. Ultra Realistic combat Always something for every Military junkie like myself. Challenging yet well laid out singleplayer campaign. Use of any kind of vehicle available rangung from Quads to Jets. Use of any role that fits you.  Fun multiplayer modes, Co-Op or PvP  Active modding community.   Cons:  You need a beast â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC to get the full expierience and a stable internet connection.  Hard to see the enemy, but the same goes for real life.  YOU WILL DIE If you are not carefull and use tactics against your enemy, If they have the upperhand on you, you won't live to tell the tale.    Overall despite that you need a beast pc to play, And some friends to get the real fun out of it. It's totally still a must have for any tactical military milsim players!  10/10 - 'Would play again' 
211	1	a	I don't even have this game, why is it allowing me to write a review?   EDIT: And as of 5/8/15, I now own the game.
213	1	a	I was just cruisin down the street until I came across some russians broken on the side of the road, we couldn't unstderstand eachother and they had guns, Decided I would be nice, come to a complete stop, get in my passenger seat and say hop in... It took them a few seconds to realize my idea because we could not understand eachother at all, I taught them english for a few things on our adventures, They took me to get me a gun, we went to the bank and robbed it, we did drugs, we even killed the police cheif after holding him hostage for 30 minutes. It was a great time, I have to say my favorite part of it all was I the fact they called me charlie and spoke a language I did not understand and I would guess what they wanted me to do until I got it correct, and when I taught them things like 'Shots Fired' they used it to explain things like 'Shots fired Police Cheif Charlie', And that meant 'Shoot the police cheif Charlie' I hope one day we meet again 10/10 would take a adventure on a Russian server with the Russian mafia again.
215	1	a	My mates and I grouped up on a Wasteland server. We gathered around each other and tried to teach our newest member how to play. He'd press a button, ask what it did, we'd explain etc. We where almost done when I heard him say 'Hey guys what does G do?'. I was aware of a clanking sound towards my feet. Then it all clicked in one hilarious moment and I shouted 'GREEEEENAAADDEEEEEEEEE!' and dove towards the ground. Everyone else dove in various direcions except for one who dove on the grenade explaiming 'I'VE GOT IT!'. The only survivor was me and the lad who threw it so I spend a good minute patching everyone up.   So when teaching your mates to play, don't all stand in a circle.
217	1	a	Great military sim/shooter, tons of mods and unlimited possibilities for different types of fun.
219	1	a	Does CoD allow you to be pinned down for 6 straight hours in a house while you cry hearing screaming and dieing?       Men Play Arma 
221	1	a	Community ruined due to famous YouTubers who play battlefield and call of duty spreading the amazingment about this game  Still my favorite game after the salty 10 year olds took over and became admins on all the servers  13/37 
223	1	a	This game.....This GAME.  Where do I start, I love the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of this game, been trying to achieve MLG at BI's series for a long time now. I've played the Arma series since I was rekkin kids on A2 from 600 on Utes with my Ruski tool, holding a base right in the middle for a few hours every day. It's a beautiful and engaging experience, that leaves you on the edge of your seat, sometimes wishing you were holding your Grandma's face to squeeze tight (till she dies)... Tactical decisions are important, using the terrain and engaging with the movement structure of your enemies is a thrilling experience, adrenaline pulses as bullets and rockets fly closeby. You will never have to remember parts of maps (minute detail), as the maps on this are so big that it allows you to use your brain, instead of arena shooters which don't challenge the psyche.   Graphics - The original Arma 3 engine includes DX11 integration and standardised PhysX interactions, due to a new update recently the game has come to include Volumetric Lighting (big +), Upgraded textures (more vibrant), Water Refraction and a host of other improvements (60+ bug fixes - glaring bugs such as the offsight RPG Alamut Optic). The graphics second Terrain to Item models, however new improvements in the recent update have subsided these issues, Gear is of a signicantly high polycount as well as Vehicles.   ISSUES: Now I'm sure most of us have had a bad experience of Arma FPS lag. And for a long time now, BI has been using the BS excuse 'It's mods.'   Although partly true, that is actually a lie. The way Arma simulates enemies, its peer to peer network structure, animation timers and no multi-threading support are the real reasons behind the terrible frames of Arma 3.  This. Needs. To. Stop.  Although too late for an A3 release, A4 must leave these issues behind.  Gameplay - Arma 3 can be a deeply tactical and engaging game. Many complex systems entwine with each other to create as much of a realistic experience as possible, for example:  - 27 Hit boxes on overall model (from head to toe) - Multiple ammo types (ballistics, AP, EPR, special purpose ((need mods for some))  - Multiple types of vests (explosive resistant, harnesses, body armour, fba) - Multiple attachments (flashlights, scopes, silencers, laserlights) - Unique damage system that many call BS but is actually indepth af for example: Armour actually takes stress under duress, which creates a deeper and more realistic feel to armour. - Your gun can deflect bullets - Bullet penetration  Different types of team play are offered in Arma 3. From 2 - 80ppl, if you wish to be in a large group, there is one out there for you. Expanded group finding features such as the Squad pages and things such as Side chat to hook up with like minded people. There are several clans of varying sizes such as mine, however there are some humungous clans for the more mil sim oriented. Now here's the real thing that makes this stand out from other shooters, I think this is a big thing: anyone can be good at this game. All it takes is knowledge and sensibility when dealing with the sort of situations Arma 3 can spawn. Such as:  - Attacking a base of 14 people by yourself, watching as a chopper crash lands into the base, explosions and debris everywhere! Bodies and people flying to and fro.. - Singing Beyonce down your mic to someone before running out and blasting their head off - Your first RPG heli kill - Your first 9.3 heli kill - Your first 7.62 heli kill - Your first 5.56 heli kil- you get the idea! - One 7.62 to get a double kill on a moving vehicle - Lagging - Dying by rocks - Lagging - Dying by terrain glitches -Lagging  Everything from Capture the Flag to Zombie mods. A favourite of mine is Sa-Matra WS, a very good mod indeed! The varying game modes and the sandbox aspect of Arma 3 really engages the community and attracts newcomers! This game can be completely different dependent on which mod you play. However many of these can easily corrupt which leaves some users unable to resolve issues.   GLARING ISSUE: Horrendous desync issues have plagued Arma 3 since its inception, these have prevented any serious types of eSports leagues. This is a detrimental experience to gameplay, and you will run into it constantly you will get killed by lag constantly and if you are okay with this buy the game, if not DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER. (Wait till Arma 4)   Ergonomics - UI in Arma 3 has never been a problem with Bohemia taking a down-to-earth approach to UI design, clearcut menu's, expanded Map features such as markers, topography etc.   Mod support has been vastly expanded with a server browser that is noob friendly, a launcher that highlights and patches missing files and full Steam Workshop support. This is a 10/10.   Finally let me just sum up the experience you will get from this game. If you're looking for sophisticated group play, come to Arma, you'll find a group of weary game travellers such as yourself, who know there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and can provide you with some irreplicable entertainment. Beware of lag and FPS issues, these are the two things hold this game back from a 9/10 or 10/10. It is my favourite game but it is still very imperfect.   Final Verdict: 8/10  
225	1	a	Stop commenting on my review.  EDIT: Get a life.
227	1	a	It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.  The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the 'follower' category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.  It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.  While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to 'find cover' (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.  Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.  Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on 'Patrol' and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.  After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.  Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.
229	1	a	This game ruined my life
231	1	a	This game is a very great Game !  It's definitly worth the money (but don't buy it for full price)   Pros:
233	1	a	the clouds look good
235	1	a	This game has potential and the tools for an amazing experience. I've had hundreds of unforgettable events playing this game with a group of people. Even after almost 1800 hours i still find this game very exciting. But your experience is truly dependent on the creativity of the mission creator and the people you play with..  If you're willing to make effort finding a good group to play this game with you will certainly have an astounding experience.  However some things you need to take in factor:  You will need a need a rather good computer, especially a good CPU to run this game smoothly.  Having a headset, or a seperate microphone is essential for communication.  It may be difficult to find the right group for you, keep searching.  Arma 3 Squads  [forums.bistudio.com]   This is not an easy game to get into, there are complex functions you may have never seen before. It will take you hundreds hours to master this game.  This game is aimed towards a more mature crowd than your average shooter.  This is a very mod friendly game, and some you may find difficult, but thankly we have things like steam workshop to make stuff more simple.  Lastly, i just want to mention big appreciation to Bohemia Interactive for constantly improving this game, and to the group i play with  Task Force Crusader  for the astounding experiences.  10/10 Make ArmA not War.

I blow up with a 300k truck with 300k worth of oil. Scream ALT+F4 while mashing keyboard. Launch arma Spawn with all my gear and oil in truck. 10/10 would play again
239	1	a	Started game Set the game to ultra settings Had a gtx 660 so I changed the settings down to medium 15-40 fps, crap Buys a gtx 970 so I changed the settings to ultra 15-60 fps, crap turns settings down to lowest 15-120 fps, crap  11/10, would spends hundreds of dollars again
241	1	a	all fun and video games until someone hop in the A10 WARTHOG
243	1	a	This game is just bad! ;) But honestly this game took my life and made it worth living... I've made so many friends playing this game that I can't even count, as well as some rivals. &lt;3 Arma 3 gives you a way to escape reality and have fun. So many different things to do that I can't even begin to explain. Just buy the game. Best decision you will ever make if you are looking to meet people especially. Or if you are just looking to shoot people or fly helicopters or jets or coordinate attacks. You can go into the heat of battle and save lives, or go in and take lives. This game will teach you how to use a compass too city boy and how to drive offroad, just watch out for them twig bushes they are deadly.    P.S nothing gives me more pleasure than taking a helicopter full of 15 geared men and crashing it into the ground ! LOL I love this game. Just kiddin, best pilot NA Combat land veteran.. Also after 3k hours in game I still play and have fun everytime I play. This game is just simply a must buy. 10/10
245	1	a	This game ruined my life...   It started out as just a fun little casual relationship, y'know, just 'oh i'll go on a multiplayer server and go play for a bit' sort of typical gamer-game relationship.   I saw there were no women wondering around... I wanted to fix it, y'know, quick fix, something to do, some options for people...   That was three years ago. now I can't even go to the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing shop without wondering how I would bloody model it and put it into this godforsaken game! it has latched onto my life like a zombie baby and is sucking all of the energy clean out of me, I can't sit and have a good play session without noticing a bug in something and trying to fix it. I now instintively open max and model when I turn the PC on, and everything I model makes its way into the game somehow, I'm in a group of modders and I swear they are a cult worshipping the Arma franchise, I can't stop myself, it's literally an addiction... I need help.   Okay on the more serious side... this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME... if, IF you are that strange masochistic type of person who loves near simulation levels of combat realism and marching across huge maps.   I'm talking PURELY from the standpoint of an Arma 'purist' if you will, not a DayZ convert, not a lifer.  Okay so the biggest pro of this game by far is the modding capability and the community, as a member of the modding community I can say just how much you can customize this game and make it your own breed of wicked software.  every major aspect of the game can be changed and it's one of the biggest and best points of this game I can truly sing the praises of.  You can add new islands, new characters and character assets, new weapons, new vehicles, new missions, new game modes, new interface aspects, you can add true to life elements such as radio comms, and ballistics. All through addon content, trust me, if you're like me and you are a sucker for variety the storage space taken up by the mods is about 4 times as much as the actual game does.  The support Bohemia Interactive have for the modding community is fantastic, by far one of the most supportive developers of modders I know, providing a variety of tools and support to help you make addons, in fact in this most recent instalment they even take direct inspiration for extensions of the game from modders themselves, from interface elements like stamina indicators and Virtual Arsenal to actual designs of assets, such as the new ENVG in the APEX expansion.  The Arma modding community is bustling with friendly helpful people ready to help you get a leg up if you're struggling. and that's hosted by Bohemia interactive themselves, not a third party.  The DLC BI makes is very much an extra platform for mod makers as much as it is extra content for players, and they've made it so that these core engine features in the game are available to everyone, not just owners of the DLC, making it a much more fair and universal system.  Other pros:  The freedom you have within the game, it's not on rails and in corridors, it's a vast open environment, open world if you wanna call it that. if you wanna go halfway across the HUGE map to hit a target at the perfect angle you are free to do so.  If you wanna kill one guy with a helicopter, and there's a helicopter available, then hot damn you can do that.  if you wanna nuke the damn place, download a nuke mod/script and live out your sadistic fantasies of pressing that red button.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i've found myself, before today, just putting a truck down in the editor and going for a drive around the island to kill some time rather than people, you can do that too, y'know, be a pacifist for the day.  You wanna roll in first person? done you wanna roll in third person? done  you wanna look around with your head and not your entire body? done. you wanna play as a guy with pink face paint? mod it, and done! wanna attach a machine gun to a rabbit? with some jigging in the editor, consider it done!   Zeus lets you rationalise your god complex: and that is exactly why I love zeus game mode. someone in the server is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off and i'm zeus they can see to it that they'll have a nice lightning bolt of 'shut the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up'  you can place down cars, planes, entire hordes of enemy troops for four guys to fight, and laugh meniacally as you watch them squeal.   With recent updates, the visuals are now so much nicer, and things run a little smoother overall.   APEX itself is a pro, like seriously, just for Tanoa, just buy it already.     Cons:   Multiplayer sometimes isn't fantastic, since the advent of DayZ and Arma Life, 9 year olds have found another game to disgrace the presence of, not fun, not saying i dislike those platforms, just the kids who ruin the good experience for the rest of us, especially when our hard work in the modding community is used and abused without permission.  The game's performance isn't fantastic, BUT, BUT hear me out here, you can do A LOT about that the sheer number of options available to you ensure that in some degree you can get a good framerate. The sheer complexity of the engine means it needs quite a lot of CPU power, so bear that in mind. I've put my PC specs down at the bottom and I get fairly okay framerates on ultra high settings, you by no means need a Â£1000 PC for this game.   It has a few quirky bugs like the AI with Xray vision and dying if you're lying prone on a rock, i find the latter happens rarely these days.   It loads like a dead snail, it's my biggest gripe with the game, is how long it takes to load I HIGHLY recommend you install it to an SSD, it's much faster.   You will LITERALLY not see the light of day if you get into modding this thing, it takes away your life.    When you love this game like I do, you put its faults aside and just damn play it.   my PC specs: AMD FX 8320E @3.2Ghz AMD Radeon R9 380 Sapphire Nitro 4gb 16GB RAM   For the record: modding this game gave me my first ever step into the games industry, so if you're serious about your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, come to the dark side...    TL;DR   Buy this game if you want a tactical sandbox shooter that gives you so much freedom to do whatever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you want its unreal, and you have a half decent system and don't mind a few quirks here and there.  Mod this game if you are serious about getting mad skills and a possible first step into the games industry if you refine it enough.   Also mod this you want to literally go insane  help me...
247	1	a	Wow I love it. Amazing game. What a joy to play. Already years beyond anything I have seen in either battlefield or cod. As a former marine. I love the hardcore nature of the game. I loged into a server and their were other people on team speak. useing real strategy. I am meeting friends. I love the fps system, I love all the ways you can customize your character. It's a dream to play. My only down side is sometimes on sandbox server the game is a little slow. I sat for over a hour just starting at trees not seeing anyone. But pvp fast action games, are a blast. The ai, is very smart, one of the best ai I have ever seen, ever. I am blown away by this game. I will easily sink a 1000 hours into this jewl of a game.
249	1	a	No one said you have to fight a war with pants on. 10/10
251	1	a	 ARMA 3 is one of my favorite video games to date. It's a massive military sandbox with tons of factions, weapons, and vehicles. What's not to like?
253	1	a	I love shooters I love realism I love editors  I love zeus I love multiplayer I love singleplayer  I love mods I love this game
255	1	a	In the mainmenu 20 FPS In game 70 FPS 10\10
17	0	a	I'm bound to get a metric tonne of dislikes for this, but I'll live with it. Please note that I'm only giving it a negative review because of my history with the Arma franchise (starting with Armed assault, moving through arma 2 and all its expansions and playing using ACE mod on each) and the fact that I had certain expectations when I inevitably pre-ordered this game.  Now please note, I have no issue with the setting, near future is fine provided it is done correctly, and in that regard I believe Arma 3 really shines. I have yet to play a game set in the near future that is as 'believable' as Arma 3, because the majority of the weapons and vehicles already exist... and a lot of them are outdated.  My issue with arma 3 is the fact that there is a shocking lack of content with the base game, there is a massive step downwards in terms of realistic fidelity, and the performance of the game is abysmal, even with someone with a computer that is massively overpowered for the game. Now, the argument could be made that no where else could I turn for a game that seamlessly integrates combined land, sea and air warfare on a massive scale, and I would believe that argument if Arma II and it's expansions didn't exist. That's the problem, this has all been done before, and to a much better standard. Why do soldiers only flinch when shot, and continue to fight back as if nothing happened? In Arma 2, if I shot the leg/arm of an AI, his movement would be impaired or his aim would be impaired, in Arma 3, nothing is simulated whatsoever. Instead, enemies take multiple hits to be downed, even with extended armour turned off!  I don't understand why Bohemia decided to create 3 factions that are more or less mirror images of one another (the reused assets between mounted MG's, grenade launchers, missile launchers alike is puzzling and frankly, lazy.), I don't understand why they removed core features such as dragging/carrying wounded allies to be healed properly by a dedicated medic, as opposed to the magical 'heal all' FAKs we have in game, and I don't understand why they're still using the same tired engine as they used 20 years ago for a game that is on a much greater scale in both terrain, amount of buildings and graphical fidelity.  Don't get me wrong, Arma III is a stroke of technical genius, managing to take the virtual reality engine and make it look THIS good is mind blowing, but what's the point in looking good, if the game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? Even when installed on an SSD, there is still the stutter loading when playing online, and I've found that in cities etc. the framerates are completely unplayable when playing with a reasonable player count of 30+.  So here are what I consider to be the pros, and the cons:  Pros: - Beautiful looking game - Interesting concepts behind a near future setting - Movement is easily better than the previous games - Stance system (whilst part of movement, is good enough to be mentioned on it's own) - Bipods (when they work) are really damn cool - AI is much smarter than previous installments, reacting better to cover and suppression - Sound design is much better, although guns still sound a bit 'off', something I rectify quite quickly with sound mods - Inventory system is really nice and intuitive - Steam workshop support makes mods easier to use, however due to the file size limit only really supports basic mods which I couldn't care less for. - Campaign is a bit more cohesive this time around, previous campaigns felt a bit aimless - Pre recorded voice lines  Cons (there are a lot of them): - The game caters to more casual players (will explain with the following points) 1. Ammo pool showing how many shots are left in your gun, regardless of difficulty setting is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid 2. AI can tank several rounds, and fire back with perfect accuracy with nothing more than a flinch, gone are the days of crippling someone's arm to reduce their accuracy or taking out their legs to stop them from moving 3. Vehicle crosshairs almost never line up with their HUD counterparts, and cannot be turned off 4. Weapons have poor penetration value, I've seen the argument being made that in the future armoured vests will allow you to survive longer, which I can appreciate, but that does not stop the fact that the kinetic force of a bullet would still wound you to the point where you are ineffective. I don't mind the soldiers surviving, but at least incapacitate them for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake. 5. Magical FAKs that heal you to the point where a dedicated medic is a luxury, not a requirement. 6. (More of a server issue than the game itself) Everyone is running casual epoch, altis life etc servers. These far outnumber the traditional game servers, which I think speaks for itself really. It's a game targetting people who aren't here for an authentic military shooter. It's here for people that want to use third person, sprint everywhere and not take things seriously. - Each faction is practically identical, there is no assymetrical balance like the previous games, everyone has one assault rifle, one type of grenade, one type of MBT, one type of transport helicopter, one type of attack helicopter, ONE JET EACH (wtf?), and the exact same grenade launchers, missile launchers, UAV's, UGV's and submarines. The recycled content is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy. - The DLC's thus far have offered very little content for their price. For example BAF in arma 2 added an entire new faction to play, with vehicles and weapons respectively. Whilst I can't comment on the expansion pack, Operation arrowhead was practically a new game, and from the PR that bohemia have released, TANOA seems about the most compelling part of Apex, which will probably run like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because the amount of trees etc. - I don't like Altis. Personal preference. - Game runs like absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on several rigs I've tried, including a 5960x, 24gb of ram, 2x Titan X's in SLI all running from an ssd to remove any loading stutter. It's just not possible to get this game running nicely. - Hardly any weapons/vehicles per faction. I touched on this briefly, but it was months until CSAT and NATO got jets, and they're both ground attackers only? Why? Why is there only one large transport vehicle shared between each faction? Why does each faction have the exact same UAV's, the same UGV's, submarines, grenades, chemlights, smoke grenades, ghillie suits, armour etc etc etc. WHAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. - Why does it take multiple bullets to drop a guy at 1m? Unless I'm using 7.62, 12.7 or intermediate cartidges, armour seems to sponge bullets for absolutely no reason. - Why can I not drag wounded allies? Or carry them?  This game drives me insane because I wanted to like it so desperately. Each iteration in a series should build upon it's predecessor, and in many regards Arma III improved in many ways, but took so many steps back that I can't recommend this game to anyone.  Now ACE 3 definitely makes this game a lot easier to stomach, but the base game is still unfortunately there. It's unfortunately the only way I could say you should play this game if you're used to Arma II. I'm sure I'll get a lot of arguments from people saying that mods will fix X, Y and Z, but the fact is; Arma II didn't need fixing, so why should Arma III?
257	1	a	ArmA 3 is certainly a great military-sandbox game. It's a hard and true-to-life experience, unless you just want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around in the sandbox area with either AI or human players. It still feels like a beta product, though.   PROS
259	1	a	Within 24 hours of buying this game, I have played 14.2 hours. I'm pretty sure it's good
261	1	a	It's okay I guess,played for a few hours.
263	1	a	Well , i bought this game on the first Alpha Days , when it was 32.99$.  I Really like Strategy (hope i wrote it right) and Simulator games &amp; FPS games.  This game Contains many objects and many ways to play , the vanilla has no many weapons nor cars and aircrafts ,  BUT , there is A BIG BUT , you can use the Workshop on steam to use Maps \ Missions \ other mods to make your playing much more funny and realistic.  if you consider spend around 40 - 50$ when it's on sale , do that , on this game of course.
265	1	a	Good, realistic.... f**k it, its ARMA 3-the best game ever 11/10
267	1	a	Love this game! This is one of the best games in the OFP/Arma series, I've already built a WarMod for it for the IFA3 mod, and 2 more WarMods i will be building for it soon. The Eden editor which is the 3d editor imo is the highlight of the game, yes theres a ton of missions, campaigns, MODS, other functions, &amp; features, scripts, codes, textures, sounds, tools, ............................ the list goes on and on, theres so many genre's of mods in this game I wonder why anyone buys other games.  The greatest thing is the community is massive, the forums are always busy the Developers are always updating fixing and adding new features, functions as well as new content sometimes, I cant recall how many times this game has been updated since its Alpha release but I think theres no other game out there that has been patched and updated like Arma3 has. Sure people will have their issues and dislikes about the game, i think every game has that. Arma3 has a high learnign curve it depends but its not limited to what is listed or what it gives you, its a very diverse, in depth, open ended, sandbox, theres so much content you can play with, so many things you can do, and create that you will get more for  your money then any other game imo. I would highly suggest that you run it with a quad core, and a decent GPU, plenty of ram, for example I have a duel core, 8gb of ram, Nvidia GTx 750ti, 850watt PSU, i average 30-35fps in what i play, CPU is the biggest thing if you can afford an upgrade upgrade the cpu above all things.  I been in the OFP/Arma series since it started and compared to the editor in the previous games, the editor in A3 is the best, it has so many features and functions and isnt that hard to learn how to create a simple mission, like in the previous games you can play your mission in the editor.  For maps which are what you play your missions on, Arma3 comes with 2 maps, they are.....MASSIVE and has tons of details, amazing work, for more maps I highly reccomend a mod called CUP Terrains CUP stands for Community Upgrade project it adds all the maps from the arma2/OA games as well as new ones in arma3! Among other things like all the infantry weapons, tanks, vehicles, and other stuff. Also there are several major popular mods for zombies for those of you who are into zombies, survival, looting like in DayZ ect,. its all there theres something for everyone in this game.  You want to play     serious military realism     Post-Apoctylyptic Zombies, lands, scenerio, and horror survival     be the Russians and kill ISIS     as the Bundswehr army     with Aliens, Dinosaurs, monsters, space, Halo     SP, MP, COOP     Realism units, clans, groups     WW2 - Iron front in Arma3, Pacific Theater, Western Front, British Germans, Russians, Italians     Code, script, textures, models, create new factions, mods, missions, campaigns, weapons, cars, tanks, jets, planes     fly in fighter jets, propelled planes, commercial jets, tourist planes     at night, underwater as a scuba diver, Halo parachute, hang gliding just explore     RTS, be a commander, a lone soldier, squad leader, give orders, be a medic, engineer, driver, pilot, machine gunner     kill terrorists, be a terrorist, be an assassin, a lone sniper, sharpshooter, a police officer, marine, army, airborne,navy     special forces, silenced, blow up stuff -things, vehicles, buildings, people, anywhere!     like an arcade, military simulation, rpg, rts, modern, WW2, Vietnam, Sci Fi, zombies, survival,racing     make a lot of friends and meet alot of interesting intelligent people!     you can do all that! Idk what else to say buy it its worth every dime, even better on sale ;) If you ever need help with the game or resources, need help getting started, want to know about mods, how to install stuff where to find stuff, either catch me on BIS forums or send me a friend invite. Cheers! :)
269	1	a	I've always meant to write a review for this game, after spending 1,700 hours in it. God knows how many hours I've spent on Arma 2. Anyways, this is one of the best games I've ever played. While I might describe this as a game, I consider this as more of an engine. Why?   Because games often restrict you to a lore, a path, tools, programed in a way without giving you the chance to explore other possibilities; they want you to experience what they want you to experience. For this game, it's different - you can choose to be a common soldier in the Vietnam war. You can choose to be a helicopter pilot in the war in Iraq. Whatever theatre, faction, weapon, uniform you fancy, there are often mods for it.   So forget about how badly optimized this game is, because the fact is with how vast the possibilities this game opens you to, you really are pushing the boundaries of this engine. People often complain about how badly optimized this game is, and at the same time complain about the lack of free will in other games. This game has the latter, so appreciate it for what it is.   The community is one of the best out there. But because of the influx of new players, also be wary of who you might run into.
271	1	a	'The best sandbox war game of the year'  Arma 3 is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive, taken to the next level. With increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! The control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE. It is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.   This game is mostly open source, Meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game. The things you can do are endless and that is it's selling point. Bohemia Interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions. This game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason. The scripting language for ARMA 3 is .sqf, Based off the C++ coding language, but it seems like a little of everything works. (there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work) I have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3, making this my most played game, by a long shot.  The best way to play this game is modded and with friends. By it's self, arma is fun, but somewhat bland, but that seems like that was part of the plan... BI (Bohemia Interactive) made the game as basic as possible to allow you and it's users to change it the way they like it!   Do I recommend this game?  YES!   This game has supplied my friends and I countless hours of playtime with new and exciting missions and firefights, and with a few basic mods it has become 400% better than before.   9.2/10
273	1	a	Don't expect 60 FPS and get ready for the most amazing tactical (or not) sandbox ever. 
275	1	a	A great simulator of my home country, Alpacastan. I appreciate the correct modelling of Alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. I also love the fact that you can recreate traditional Alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. It always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, Backwards Cap Guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the Great Cleansing of Stan.  RIP, he will be missed.  11 frolicks out of 10.
277	1	a	If you want to play the best military simulator experience, Arma 3 is your best bet. It has the combat, vehicles, weapons, it has it all. I have played Arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun. There are a variety of different game modes that you can play: such as Wasteland, which is less serious than others; Life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of DarkRP in Garry's Mod; Insurgency and Domination, they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously.  Lovely game, 10/10.
279	1	a	The most comprehensive military sim out there, setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons, vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for.  The game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original Operation Flashpoint, released over 10 years ago. However, of all the iterations, Arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most. These aren't big changes, but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth.  Graphically, it's convincing. It isn't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel ALIVE. You can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on (Yup, it is a real place).  If you don't know anything about this game, the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic'. You are a single soldier in a large, real-time conflict. You can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go. Expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead. Don't expect to behave like Rambo and to survive.  I wouldn't consider this game 'complete' just yet- for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing, the main campaign is only 1/3 released. That being said, it's the community that really supports this game. Mods like Dayz show how flexible and open-ended the game can be. Really, Arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support, letting the community come up with the best content.  Personally, I haven't spent much time in the large-scale multiplayer side of things. I prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable. Expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own. I've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island. Yup, on my own, with no NPCs or other players. I love the sights and sounds. I love exploring over the next mountain, or lounging about on a beach, soaking up the digital rays. I don't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game- the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and I chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment I could extract from it.  The community is what makes this product what it is. They're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come. You'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team-worthy fashion and thanks to the Steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer.  Buying this game is an investment. The developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must-have title, though it could take several years to reach that stage. Don't expect gameplay that's easy to jump in to, nor should you expect a fun standalone experience. But this game is no COD. By default it's not a mainstream game, but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless.
281	1	a	The only thing in the known universe more addictive than heroin.
283	1	a	Step 1: Join realism server. Step 2: Get yelled at for being noob. Step 3: Join Exile server. Step 4: Get yelled at for being hacker. Step 5: Make own server. Step 6: Get reported for abuse. Step 7: ???? Step 8: Profit (?)
285	1	a	Ruins your social life.  So many mods to play. So much gamemodes to play.  Dont buy this game if you want a social life.  Trust me... It's too late for me.  20/10 would glitch in rock again
287	1	a	Walked into a table, died.  Would recommend.
289	1	a	This is my favorite game of all time.  Pros: +Extremely realistic (AI acts intelligently, weapon handling depends on fatigue, distance, etc) +Great community (for the most part) +Thousands of great mods (try Exile, King of the Hill 1944, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Epoch, etc., all available for free from Steam Workshop. Other mods can be downloaded from  Armaholic.com)  +Ability to make your own scenarios/mods +No running and gunning- tactics and planning are the only way to win +Huge learning curve keeps kids away (this is a very good thing) +Looks great, even if the framerate is on the low side. I get 30 FPS playing KOTH on an i5-2500k with 12GB RAM and a GTX 560. Not a beast of a computer, but it has no problem running this game. +Ability to play in third-person or first-person views.  Cons: -Can't drag a fallen team member to safety before reviving (this is a big difference from Arma 2) -Updates can mess with mods -The vanilla game doesn't have a huge selection of uniforms/guns (this can be easily fixed though with mods, so it's no big deal; however, some servers don't support mods which makes the selection useless) -Still expensive. You need the DLC, as many servers require it.  In summary, buy this game if you want a mature shooter that values tactics and punishes a lack of teamwork. This isn't a twitch shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield; it is a game that tries to be as realistic as possible and entirely succeeds, in my opinion (note: I have nothing against COD or BF).   It is worth the money.  100/100
291	1	a	Great game let me get to some negatives... -Expensive DLC (Buy on specials) -Game doesn't come with lots of content(Arma 2 came with a lot of content) -Expect a lot of downloading(mainly mods and mission files) Positive -LOTS OF MODS TOO DOWNLOAD -again LOTS OF MODs to download
293	1	a	This game features a lot more than it may seem. It's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over. Everytime you play will be a different experience, may it be your role, the difficulty, or the ai. It's all different every time. You can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it's not really game-breaking, it's just a moment you can laugh about. Plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable, There's so much different changes you can do to the game, from changing your character's voice or face, up to making a whole addon and even more. Im not gonna say the game's completely perfect though. The main problem may be the community, but from time to time you'll not meet with that problem; some people will be nice to you and help you if you're a newbie to the game, and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare, as people dont appreciate them on the servers. The gameplay; Now that is one hard question to answer. The gameplay mostly matters about you, and the gamemode, how you want to play, will still be valid, but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he's only using a simple rifle with no scope. As you would guess, another problem is the AI, sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it's just the best AI you can find in a game. now, im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it's better to find out yourselves, but i'll just say that King Of The Hill, Wasteland(mostly fun with friends), and Zeus(you'll be most likely to spend days on this one) are the ones i recommend. The community: The community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and/or experience. I'm not gonna say much about it except this but there's alot you can say about the community. The Engine: this game requires a beefy pc(currently at its state) but the engine is brilliant, It can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard CPU usage. The engine is mostly dependant rather more on the RAM than the CPU, i recommend atleast 6-12 RAM for this game if you're gonna play it alot.  Overall: The game's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it, altough you will find mostly funny moments and non-serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable. Certain people refer to this as a 'Walking Simulator' but the point is that ArmA III is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms, you WILL find yourself walking and running alot to objectives, but that's how it is in real life too. The game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming. You can find alot to do in this like commanding AI and/or players, which is always hard at the start, and participating in large assaults on towns such as Kavala. In my opinion, ArmA III is worth a shot.  -Lankercool, Commander and Soldier, also regular Zeus player in the ArmA III Community.
295	1	a	Its OK.............. :) 3560 hours later. THiS GAME I AWSOME!!!!!!!! (and still getting better by the day)
297	1	a	A really nice game. If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. Do missions or just have fun in some modes. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend !
299	1	a	When The Community Can change the game logic
301	1	a	THE GOOD -------------------- This game is actually the 4th installment of the Arma series and I've been playing since the start. The developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game. They keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom Real Virtuality engine rather than replacing it, as well as adding new campaigns, missions, vehicles, weapons, and game modes.  The part where this game REALLY shines, however, is the community driven mods. The game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make ANYTHING they want out of this game. It may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page, but I've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims, 'grand theft auto' like games (Arma Life), hardcore zombie games (DayZ), a StarGate tribute which had working, animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show, ww2 sims (Invasion 1944), Jurassic Park tributes, and so much more.  These mods take a lot of work to create, sure, but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing. Simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down. Now add some waypoints for them to attack a town. Add some soldiers inside the town. That's it! If you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers, using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy. This all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on. Want to do more? Read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you'll have the ability to make suicide bombers, 'battle busses' (essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it), nuclear bombs, and really ANYTHING you can imagine. If you have any issues, someone will be willing to help you out either on  reddit.com/r/armadev  or on the official Bohemia Interactive forums.  I hope you'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or I just freshly made in the editor! Even if you don't like making your own content, there are fun mods already out there such as the popular Battle Royale mod where you're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear. Just look around and you'll find endless entertainment in this game!   THE BAD --------------- I mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced. This does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games, but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs. Another warning I would give would-be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your PC. People who have rigs that they THINK are powerful because they can play Battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise: Arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware. At the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware, even when pretty impressive, just doesn't get along with the game that well at the moment.
303	1	a	ARMA 3 is a great game if you don't like having fun, like me.  You're going to be fed bitter morsels of fun only after suffering like Sisyphus. But unlike Sisyphus, you will eventually succeed and the fleeting moment of victory will be much better as a result of your misery. It's even better when the suffering is compounded by playing with friends. After multiple restarts because a BDRM annihilated you with pinpoint accuracy from 3 miles away, you'll have a great time.  The main problem with this game is that it's set in 2035 and you're fighting Post-Human Space Iranians in a tank from the 70s. Thankfully, this game is supported by an excellent modding community and you can use mods to take the game back to the greatest era of human history; The Cold War. You might not get the chance to die on the atomic battlefields of the North German plains, but you can get pretty close to it thanks to this game and the dedication of the modding community.   Eventually, you will reach the mod singularity where you will simply have too many mods. You will spend hours in virtual arsenal making the perfect loadout. You will think 'Finally I create a decent depiction of an Iraqi republican guardsman circa 1991!' but you will feel nothing.  Thanks to this game I have had to confront the existential horror of consciousness, and I would recommend it to anyone.
305	1	a	i don't even own this game why can i review it  10/10 it's meh
307	1	a	Arma 3 isn't game... its a way of life.  I know this now because I am one with this game. I am this game. This game is me.  After 1564.2 hours invested in this game... I have come to the conclusion that Arma 3 isn't a video game but a government research project into alternate reality simulations. This isn't a game... it is their first draft of the Matrix.  I... I have done things in this alternate reality that I never thought I'd do... I learned how to fly helicopters at terrifying speeds just inches from the ground and I've dropped scores and scores of fine young soldiers into battle. I have used a supply crate as a helicopter-borne wrecking ball. I have learned how to operate rocket launchers with extreme prejudice and impunity.  In one instance, I became a heroin running gang-leader that got into an epic shoot out with the police that ended up with me flying away in a stolen helicopter high on adrenaline (and a little cocaine)... then shortly after that I was in a high-speed police chase that ended the lives of several good police officers in fiery explosive deaths as their cars tumbled and rolled around corners as I zipped away at 300km+ in the worlds fastest Prius. I have sung Kumbaya over a barrel fire at a meth lab with my mortal enemies.  I once crashed a jet straight into a single enemy soldier because God Bless America, god dangit!  Most importantly - I've learned from this game. This game has taught me a lot of stuff... like that stairs can straight up kill you. I moved to a single story house because of this and I am happy to report that no stairs have tried to kill me since! I have also stopped climbing on and around rocks because they can swallow you and you'll never get out of the rock... I have put up posters all around my neighborhood advising parents to keep their children away from stairs and rocks, lest they end up dead or swallowed whole!  If I had to look back on it, I'd say my feelings are like Lois Griffin in this clip -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlHTPDDguF4  - WHAT DID I DO??!?! WHAT DID I DOOOO!?!?!? *Wretches* - I mean that in the best way possible... what a delightful waste of time... way too much time!
309	1	a	 Very Addictive   I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military sandbox shooter. This game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat. Before I get any farther into this review, I would like to point out that this game is nothing like COD or Battlefield. That doesn't necessarily mean it can't be fast paced, but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some. I'm going to focus primarily on general gameplay, rather than go in-depth with mods.   Overall Gameplay 9/10  This game is often called a walking simulator, however this game is so much more than that. Once you play long enough, you just look at walking as another method of travel. You start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectives/other players. Do you want to risk driving to a location, only to get blown up by AT (anti-tank) or would you rather take the longer, but mostly safer method of walking. Once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk. That being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure. This is perhaps one of favorite things about this game. Want to stealthily insert from the sea SEAL style? Would you rather set up on a hill 1.5km away and pick off the enemy? Or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path. The decision is ultimately yours. You may find that a lot of this isn't in the vanilla game, but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more.   Combat 8/10 : Combat is great, but it has its problems (some very frustrating problems at that). PvP combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics. However... The AI is ridiculous. It has gotten better overtime, but the AI is completely unpredictable. Sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off, or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off, only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim. Don't let that ruin your experience though. Some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the AI doing something completely hilarious (EX: taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason).   Mechanics 9/10:    falls 2 feet to the ground, dies...  To be fair combat mechanics in Arma 3 are much better IMO than that of previous Arma titles. Bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done. It can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the .50 cal Lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles. Bullet spread/drop seems realistic enough. If your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real you'll be mostly dissappointed, but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little. There are lots of options for movement and stances (they can actually benefit you greatly in combat). I HIGHLY recommend staying away from rocks. I have no idea why, but rocks can instakill/trap you if your not careful. Not all rocks are like this, mostly just large ones... stay away...    Visuals 9/10:  When first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking. For the full experience I would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume. The immersion is very enjoyable. If you can't run the game on ultra dont feel left out. It still looks great, and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online (being able to see through foilage/fog).   There's probably a lot I could add to this review, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods. There are too many good ones to list.  I may sound a little biased because I love this game so much, but if the above that I described sounds remotely like something your interested in then I highly recommend it.
311	1	a	Arma 3 is a tactical military shooter, it has an unique spot in having the biggest maps with most players combined. Imagine yourself 120+ players in 2 or 3 teams fighting it out incl vehicle warfare... Tanks planes helis even boats included in that list, described at the shop description arma really sends you to war. The bad side is that this comes at a cost of at least a good pc to even being able to play it to full potential. And even then you limited by what the servers can pull off, eventually you will enjoy the game a lot more in smaller groups.  But arma 3 is not all about war, with steam work shop full of content or not to say the least about 'armaholic'... Arma 3 has so many possibilities that you won't run out of content to play quickly. With arma life which pretends to be a GTA with real players as cops medics and military. Included with gangs and your own choice to be the bad or the good guy and fight it out in the wild wild west. Or mods based on the older arma 2 mod DAYZ still to this day better than the standalone... But also with more known game styles like KOTH which is more a team death match with a level and money systeem.  What the best side and also directly the worst side of arma 3 is that everyone can hire a server. Games can never really die in this way, look at how many still play arma 2 daily... When a game dies mostly seen in EA games shutting down their servers, arma on the other hand will never really close down. Aslong everyone can hire a server whenever they feel like it... Great community can grown upon this but also people can abuse it, with scripts with saved slots as example. Pay the server owner â‚¬10.- a month and you can always play (join the server because only vips(donator) can join the last 20/30 slots). While every server has to pay hes server rent, servers with scripts like this or those that show xx amount of players always on the server is a big issue. (mostly combined to too double the effect ofc...) It is funny because i've been admins on several servers, have seen how it has been run from several different points of view. And none of these server owners have ever used or felt forced to use any of these scandals so yes i'm surprised... While most just hire the server as a kind of donation to the game or those who get real donations from community members help the game thrive.  Arma 3 also has a great single player game the voice overs are sometimes weak to say the least but it goes... I won't really call it a story, although a story is being told, just see it like a training course for the multiplayer. ;) Arma 3 also gives you a very strong but still simple 3D game editor whereby making missions is as ease that everyone can do it. Or also known zeus which makes you being able to play as a game master, you can make missions or sent waves while you friends are playing. It gives you an eagles eye of view of the battlefield and gives you the tools to spawn and do almost anything you can Imagine. Arma 3 is one of those uncut gems and well worth every penny you put into it.
313	1	a	The game it's self is awesome, especially since I've upgraded my machine.  You really need a good CPU it'll make the difference!  A couple of bad points to it thought.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCKGWReDeQ8  Admin abuse.... Honestly this was my first experience of 'Online' play.  Also you'll notice the water marks. I was spawned in with gear that I shouldn't of been able to wear. So I'm punished by being spammed with Water marks of icons that fit the mod in order to buy that DLC.   I wouldn't of cared if it didn't effect the entire game.   Edit:  Admin being a prick.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTjb56MLgU  Admin cheating  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaO3-R2a9sk 
315	1	a	Arma 3 is one of those games where you feel aslthough you yourself have been transferred onto the battlefield. The gameplay, especially when paired with a friend is to die for and the extensive DlC's and community content mean that you will be able to squeeze all your moneys worth out of this game. Where it's demanding on your hardware it makes up for this with it's at times almost photorealistic graphics. One spot that could use work in my opinion is the weapon handling, clunky and hard to manage at times the gunplay dosen't always feel as realistic as other games I have played. All in all though I am absolutely in Awe of this game as I was with its predecessors. Very good game that I would definately recommend.
317	1	a	Here's a story just to tell you what kind of game this is. Lemme start by telling you this game is definitely more of a template than it is a full game solely based on its modding capability alone.   So I have a Vietnam Mod for this game, adds new maps, units, weapons, etc. Our platoon lands in the jungles at LZ Fiona, a clearing in the jungle in the hills. We spread out and head into the jungles. A shot rings out and the LT. takes one in the chest. V.C. Ambush. I hit the ground and ready my M16A1 I have no clue where the rounds are coming from but they're coming. As I'm lying in the brush three figures run by, but they don't look friendly. Startled I swerve quickly back into their direction and let loose a full auto barrage from my 20 round magazine, I see blood flying out of the figures and then they drop. I got three of them. I look back ahead of me and start letting out one-round bursts trying to suppress the enemies on the opposite hillside. Ammo's getting low and the bullets keep coming. I climb through the muck and grunge of the jungle floor to a nearby friendly, he's hit but no time to mourn now. I pilfer through his gear and find what I needed, sweet sweet ammo, ~30 bullets left. I reload, and the hell begins anew.
319	1	a	So real I thought I was going to die irl.
18	0	a	Sad, What was once a great simulation has turned into a big middle finger to loyal followers. DLCs that should have been released with the original game because let's face it, Even on release, it was still a beta. I have followed Bohemia since operation flashpoint and I loved their games and their attention to realism.....Arma 3 could have been so much but releasing half dlcs instead of the old good hardy dlcs you use to get with Arma 2 and still not fixing glitches, I can no longer support this game. Heck, even all the arma clans that switched to arma 3 is suffering membership loss due to the unplayability of this game on multiplayer and that's where this game really shined at one point. It's a sad day.
321	1	a	Honistly i dont know how the game is i finshed half the story and played a lil altis life But i just sit in editor playing with the ai all day )_)
323	1	a	A man robbed me for the keys to my quadbike, he then proceeded to drive my quad into a fence, causing the quad to explode.  10/10 Justice was served by an inanimate object
19	0	a	This is a review for the Single Player Experience.  As I have a busy life, I donâ€™t enjoy the MP side of this game. Most of the adoration you hear about this game is solely the MP community. Most of the cool videoâ€™s you see on YouTube are made by and for the MP guys. And they can only get those shots with real people, as the AI is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  PROS: Beautiful graphics. Value. Moding community. Be Careful. A lot of the mods will degrade your game to the point of it being unplayable and it will take a full uninstall/reinstall to get working right again.  CONS: BUGS/GLITCHES/CRASHES NIGHTLY!!! STILL AFTER 3 YEARS!  In the editor, never merge SP missions. They will never work.  In the Eden editor, if you click Play/SP with Briefing, and then in the briefing you click on Cancel, that mission will never, EVER work right again. You will have to start from scratch.  AI. Legendarily Horrible. I can only assume it is on purpose. There is no way this AI could be real. It has to be some perverted experiment.  Mission Planning. Doesnâ€™t exist. You will have to find a MOD. See above. You will have to learn, I canâ€™t believe I am writing this, you have to learn a script in order to make your own missions. Something they forgot to tell you on website/box/adverts/videos. JOKE!  Command and Control. Joke.  Communications. Joke.  Game Value. Low.  Simulation Value. Non-Existent.  Technology: It is supposed to be the year 2035! JOKE. The tech in this game is more like 1955.  Conclusion: The only redeeming qualities of this game are; Potential. Someday, this game might be good. And it is the only game of its kind. But they spend all of their (BIS) limited talent on areaâ€™s we donâ€™t care about. FIX the AI. Make this game playable for SP. Basics. Do some research!   DONâ€™T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REALISTIC MILITARY SIMULATION! This isnâ€™t it! You will literally spend 50% of your time scripting. 45% fighting the game AI/GUI, and 5% fighting the enemy.  Good Luck!
325	1	a	This is the best Golf simulator out there. You really can feel the swing in ur whole upper body as you go on killing people with your towed zamak beneath ur transport bird on wasteland sa-matra. And the crowd (victims) goes wild in the global chat 1/2 times you manage to score. This keeps you going for hours and hours. The occasional aa missile hitting you in the side makes for an even more interesting golf course as you will need to 'get out of the rough' and repair/re fuel the heli to get back on the fairway  12/10 will golf again
327	1	a	Fantastic game. Very slow to learn alone but with friends on a large server.. was fun. Hours of laughs, stress, goose bump urban warfare and guerrilla warfare. Very realistic and the graphics... WOW! Goodbye Call of Duty and Battlefield... Arma 3 is the real deal!
329	1	a	My honest to Gaben review. Base Game: -Open Arma 3. -Find highly populated server. -Spawn. -Realize everyone is chillin' in the military base talking about things completely irrelevent to the game. -Select weapon. -Walk 3km to enemy outpost. -Realize you could have taken a vehicle. -Try to take on over 10 AI. -Get 360 noscope-one-tapped by an AI. -Stare at computer and take a moment to realize what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ had just happened. -Close Arma 3.  Epoch: -Find high pop. server. -Find a gun. -Freak out and think gun is rare. -Find 6 more guns. -Go to trader. -Sell guns. -Buy car. -Lost car to bandits &lt;10m away from safezone. -Complain to admins. -Attempt to steal car back. -Get banned for stealing car. -Shake head. -Close Arma 3.  Exile: -Spawn. -Run 10km and find a 5.56 magazine with 1 round. -Throw your hands into the air in disgust. -Close Arma 3.  Altis Life: -Spawn. -Run to drug farm. -Crash ATV into a rock. -Call taxi. -Taxi repairs ATV. -Collect drugs. -Drive ATV back to main city. -Killed by 'Freedom fighters'. -Respawn. -Xxx_ThugL1feM4ster_xxX approaches you. -Xxx_ThugL1feM4ster_xxX roasts you. -Fellow civilian gets in man's face, 'What u talkin bout boi. Wut u doin to tis guy her.' -Man freaks out and sings Drake. -Civilian: 'Shoot me ri-now. Do it. I dare you. You ain't go the b-' -Civilian dies to gangster. -Run. -Get mowed down by the random civilians with military-grade weapons. -Respawn. -Go to ATM. -ATM glitches and resets money. -Bash keyboard. -Close Arma 3.  10/10 would stick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in blender again.
331	1	a	Best milsim game out there, huge community
333	1	a	Downloaded Arma, and then opened it. Proceeded to do a horrible tutorial, but after that, it was just beautiful. Opened an RPG server, and ran 2 miles to get to an atm, and ran 2 miles to a shady car salesman. Bought a car, spent the next half hour trying to figure out how to actually get into it. After I finally managed to glitch into it, I underestimated it's ability to travel at light speed, which in turn caused me to crash into a wall. After that, my car was a smoking mess, with a top speed that a sloth could outdo.  10/10 would crash again
21	0	a	Game requires several gigabytes of modding to be playable. Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently.   The game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a 'realism' mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either.   You can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car.  The body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less.  Many of the 'futuristic' weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar.  It's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point.  Buildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes.  Overrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance 'coincidently' where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking?  Ridiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game. The Iranian soldiers also look like bugmen or bumble-bees.
335	1	a	Military sandbox. Fun. Niche.  Terrible game, though. 10 year old engine doesn't do it any good. Would fail immediately if there was any competition.
22	0	a	Dear Bohemia,  Instead of releasing more islands and single player garbage no one cares about, how about you guys do something about the game's atrociously bad framerate?   This game is very heavily CPU dependent (doesn't really tax your graphics card at all) and yet I still get lousy framerates with an overclocked i7.
23	0	a	This part was written when I had an FX 6300 OCed at 4 Ghz, 8GB ram and an HD 6870: For my current config, look way down below. ------------------------------------------- Operation Flashpoint was good, I bought it three times. Arma was acceptable, I bought it and its addons. Arma 2 was excellent, I bought it twice and I also received it as a gift over Steam.  but frankly, arma 3 is completely disappointing: In 2015-16, Arma series becomes a pay to win with Marksman DLC and APEX addon. In 2035, rocket launchers are utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the art of guidance systems has been completely lost. In 2035, IFVs are going slower than tanks and flips magically for no reasons. In 2035, your occular implants shows you full screen advertisings for having been a passenger in an helicopter that no one cares about, added in a DLC. In 2035, Weapon zeroing is made en masse over advertised values for ammo (ie: if your ammo is made to leave the muzzle at 800ms and actually leaves it at 920(as for the Katiba). then you will definitely not hit your target beyond 500 meters because it will overshoot it. In 2035, AA rockets are tracking the target as soon as they leave the launcher, good luck if the target is going downward because your rocket will go downward too. In 2035, Westland Lynx are equiped with rockets, not guided missiles. In 2035, the Fennek is an MRAP, but on the plus side, the retractable periscope is funny to use. (Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 9 FPS. (Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 20 FPS, but the players will teleport all the time, shoot before you see ! Also in 2035, every soldier is the fattest America, Greece, or Iran has to offer and can run for 2 meters provided you are not carrying anything heavy, like a weapon. In 2035, players will be so stupid that you will want to kill them all, even your teammates, because they will join the strongest teams. In 2035, AA radars are the most useless stuff ever created, only usefull for single targets, and on the ground, what happened to the Operation Flashpoint scanner ? In 2035 you will finally be able to go underwater, too bad there is nothing to do there. and finally: in 2035, you can forget about usefull vehicles, here MRAPS do not have AT launchers, and AA tanks have a ridiculously short range, bad accuracy, useless radar, and only 4 rockets which MAY allow you to shoot down one helicopter hovering and not using countermeasures.  In short: the future SUCKS.   for the record I had 976 hours of play time on arma 3 at the time I wrote this (now 1200-ish). This number is still bound to increment, but I can not recommend the game for anyone until they fix their engine, and the future.  Edit: I will be nice for once: The ballistic system is a nice addition to Arma. sorry I ran out of nice things to say. Yet another edit: If modding the game was not such a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥, and if Bohemia did not RELY on modders to make their game for them, I would probably recommend it. Of course that means modding it is a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ (unless you are creating everything from scratch, which means you can make everything and as such should not bother with this engine) and that I do not recommend it.  A word for JPS2004308 who commented this rant: How does that apply to what I said ? Also I would very much like to point out to everyone here that you copied / pasted your comment to all negative reviews of arma 3.  With an I-5 6600K OCed 4.4Ghz, 16GB ram, SSD drive and an noisy RX 480: -------------------------------------------------------------- At last ! This game runs smoothly (it is way less of a torture to play, jumped from 9 to 70 FPS and my view distance is 7.5km instead of 3km(1km with 19 FPS).  -------------------------------THE APEX RANT: I have to point out if BI wanted *me* to buy the APEX add-on, they should have never dropped those utterly crappy DLCs on the market first. I am sure the new map will be gorgeous and fun to play.  As I said I did not buy it and now the main menu changed, with almost every sub section containing an APEX related link that will *invite you* to buy it. Now if you launch the editor, you will be able to place *APEX UNITS* that you cannot use, which obvioulsy clutters your UI, Same thing about ZEUS. And if you look closely, APEX equipment, even when it is just a retexture of a piece of gear you already have access to (jungle camo version of X weapon), you will not be able to use it, a chasm between APEX and non-APEX in multiplayer, if you want your enemies not to be able to use your weapon, just get APEX. Oh and far worse: two pieces of gear are way tougher than the A3 equipment. If you want to be invincible in multiplayer: Take the Viper helmet (Special purpose helmet of the CSAT) and the Special purpose uniform. those two are way more effective than the former CSAT uniform, to crown it all take a GA Carrier GL Rig, and enjoy your walking tank which is something like 30% more resilient than the former possible walking tank (Defender Helmet + GA carrier rig + CSAT fatigues).  So yes, they are turning the game into a Pay to Win and this since Marksman DLC. ----------------------------------------------------------------- To be honest if you want to really enjoy A3, go find the ACE3 mod first. For some very strange reason they are the ones who, in my opinion, bohemia should hire. Yes, you can stick with ACE2 and arma2 if you are intelligent, but ACE3 corrects a lot of the 'future sucks' I wrote above, it seems though they have decided to not take in account the date of 2035 and stuck with what they know to be currently true. While it seems retrograde, it turns out to be way more futuristic than what bohemia did: At least Titan rockets can make top attacks now. And for those of you who like to be even more of a danger to your teammates, there is a dead man's switch, and the ability to strap explosives on your vehicle (or the enemy's). Also insert here some nice comment about the RHS mod, but to be honest I expected no less from those guys. Go download it instead of buying APEX, it is free and it is good.   -----------------------The 'Did you find this review helpful' rant: Okay so people around find reviews 'not helpful', for some reasons there are more 'unhelpful reviews' not recommending this game than there are recommending it (basically I am pretty sure that if I pressed the 'recommend' button people would find this review more helpful). THINK A BIT you pieces of trash fanboys, what you are doing (Saying 'no') makes negative reviews having more weight than positive ones, the only problem with that being steam forcing people to show only negative reviews to see them. A not helpful review could be some random comment or inside joke as there are many around. An helpful review points out what is wrong or what could be improved.

337	1	a	It's like 30 games in one. The mods and scenarios etc are amazing thanks to a great community!
339	1	a	Democracy Implementation Simulator 2016 10/10
341	1	a	Really nice game, this is not like Battlefield or Call of Duty, this is real war! This game has everything and its gameplay is addictive.  I recommend you to run this game on a good PC.
343	1	a	Get the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off Side!
345	1	a	It's difficult to compare Arma to another game since it's so unique. The gameplay is not your typical shooter as it incorporates strategic elements and doesn't play like a traditional FPS. Console gamers will have no issues with this game's controls even as their first shooter on a PC.  Arma has a slight learning curve, it may be a little confusing at first until you learn how things work and learn to take cover. Arma has a lot of little details to gameplay that you can improve upon to give yourself and edge such as the stance adjustment controls. But they aren't vital for successful gameplay. Arma is only as complex as you want it to be. Even though it is a simulation game, it feels much more natural to play than other simulations.  Singleplayer - The story is actually pretty good, some of the scenarios definitely have a challenging OP:Flashpoint feel to it which I'm a fan of. It's divided into 3 episodes with their own chapters, each episode giving a new perspective to the conflict and upping the scales of battle. There's also a Bootcamp mini-campaign which will help new players a lot.  Multiplayer and Community - Arma is a great game to play alone, it's even better together. There's lots of public servers with a variety of gamemodes that you can just jump into. Lots of awesome custom scenarios too such as the Co-Op scenario Invade and Annex, as well as the PvP scenarios such as KoTH and Wasteland. But the best experience is playing with an organized group. There are casual co-op groups, PvP clans as well as hardcore roleplaying 'milsim units'. You can feel around for what's right for you.  Editor - Arma has always had a very powerful Mission Editor tool and has open support for custom scripts. This alone is all we needed to make missions. Then BI gave us Zeus - an in-game editor, look up some videos - this alone will entertain you for hours by yourself. Now BI has also promised a 3D Mission Editor to cover even finer details.  Mods - The game is advertised as a military simulator and it does a great job of that just as-is. But really it's whatever you want it to be and you can deepen the simulation aspects with user content. The community is actively pumping out amazing mods for this game and BI has always been highly supportive of community content (even to the point of cash giveaways from the Make Arma Not War competition). If you can think of something cool to add to Arma, it's probably already got a download link.  Criticism - Although the game engine gets some flak for being 'unoptimized' (BI has been improving on the game's performance significantly) when you think about it, how many game engines have this kind of attention to detail in such a wide scope of gameplay? You can be infantry (even fight underwater with certain assault rifles), skydive/HALO jump, pilot a transport chopper, fly a jet, drive a tank, use artillery, anything. Not to mention the detail of the environment even to the starmap. What other game can you think of tracks the temperature the ground depending on time of day and when last it rained therefore affecting your thermal optics? Yea, thought so.  DLC - Arma 3's DLC is optional, and you can just get modded content which are not affected. Even if you don't buy the DLCs you'll get the improvements to the game and still be able to play with anyone who has/doesn't have DLC. Just wanted to clear up the myths of Arma 3's DLC.  I've been playing since the Alpha/Beta with 1,000+ online hrs and I'm still not bored. Arma 3 and Arma overall as a series has come a long way and has improved tremendously and BI listens and improves from community feedback. Arma games have a long lifespan and there are a lot of people just buying it now. It's been almost 2 years since the Alpha was released, and expect Arma 3 to be active for at least another 3-5 years, probably more. Think about it, why buy a bunch of other games when Arma can be all of them for one price? Definitely the most well-spent money I've ever spent on a game for the enjoyment I've gotten so far and will continue to have. No doubt about it. I'm glad I could support such an awesome studio, keep up the great work BI.
25	0	a	Arma III is a good game with a good concept of what it is trying to do. They have started to roll out the campaign, finally after a few months after realese. What helped Arma II was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game, as this seems to be the direction that Arma III is going and that for one thing is excellent. This could spur some very interesting gameplay and I am hoping it would catch on with groups such as ShacTac or LSG just like in Arma II. Graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor, implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game.   Now for the downfall. Not everyone has this but many people do. The game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise CPU and GPU properly.  (http://i.imgur.com/pkwvj34h.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/RQog0QF.jpg)  These two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful. Playing the game at 10-25 FPS is not possible. You are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance. The BiS developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem, moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining. This feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers.  When it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly. A similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is 'too hard and we are not willing'  (SOURCE:http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/discussions/0/864961722019263834/  ). Really I do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them. They are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising.  Finally PROS: Excellent Multi-Roll Military Sim Beautiful Graphics IMO Way Smoother than Arma II ex. shooting,aiming Altis and Stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplay Improved physics with bullets and vehicles The ragdolls!  CONS: Severe performance issues and utilisation The sound assets could be better (That is nothing mods cannot sort) Game feels incomplete having only a select few vehicles/weapons The campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incomplete  Thanks for reading!    **Edit 
347	1	a	Much better than the running simulator.
349	1	a	Pros: -One of the best if not greatest military simulator -Ability to be modded -Downloads missions and addons off steam -DLC is reasonably priced for the content -Exceptional graphics compared to ArmA 2  Cons: -Really buggy -Can lag some days but other days runs smooth -Some features could have been changed or even updated  Overall I would recommended this to anyone who wants to be heavily involved into a military sim that can either be modded to play zombies, roleplay or military pvp
351	1	a	The Bohemia Interactive, well-known for the VBS series for the armies, have released the arma 3 as of september 13, 2013. It is a very renowned and creditable game because they showed their efforts to embody a variety of things in the game : constellations, military realities, and so on. We can easily find out about why it deserves to be popular.  We can create the mission by ourselves. This huge merit makes us to deal with enemies in a environment that continuously changes. Plus, we can play the game in various game missions, not a fixed ones.  Not only that, the addon system is a bonus factor that help us to enjoy the arma 3 in customised circumstances. You can imitate whatever you want using the addon system.  I want to say that you have to buy this game if you are reluctant to buy it. Given that arma series is a civilian eddition of VBS series, it is clear that this game is a perfact fit for you. I didn't mention lots of realities of arma 3 though.
353	1	a	my girlfriend bought me this...... 6 months later she said it's either arma 3 or her.... damn im gonna miss her.....  great game  would ex-gf again.  11/10
355	1	a	I'm a huge fan of the series (since the good old operation flashpoint), but now i'm hugely disappointed by what public multiplayer has already become! Arma was a Military Simulator aimed for those who like the genre, 90% of public servers today are RPG. For me Altis Life is the plague of ArmA... There needs to be a forced filter to remove them from the server browser. To get that real 'Arma' experiance nowadays you need to play with friends or join a group/clan... No way to get the real Arma experience on public servers. (Sorry for my poor English)
357	1	a	I bought the game a day before it went on sale :|
359	1	a	This game has a very steep learning curve and difficult controls, but once you figure it all out the possibilites are endless, there are so many different games and mods and opportunities with this game that its crazy. Like doing military roleplay and stuff? Join a squad and do unit gameplay. Wanna do TDM style of a game? King of the Hill. Wanna do co-op missions? It has it. Wanna play a survival game? Millions of different types. Wanna play GTA Online without the hackers? Altis Life.   The list goes on and on. This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing I cannot stress this enough but you have to put the hours in to learn the controls and how the game operates
361	1	a	Made an enemy outpost as Zeus when my friends were riding along the road. They did not suspect a thing. God bless America.
363	1	a	Great game , do not listen to people with their 'pay to win' comments. This game is not made for that purpose. This game is made to be a military simulator. Not another variant of your standard bad CS/COD shooter games. Do you want military simulation ? This is what you should go for.
365	1	a	This is a review and story about my time in Altas Life, one of the many gamemodes that Arma 3 has to offer. For anyone who doesn't know Altis Life is a real life simulation mode in Arma 3 with civilians, cops, rebels, gangs, and more. Now let's begin. &gt;Be me &gt;Playing Terraria because of the new update. &gt;Get skype called by my friends, asking me to help them join them in mining and selling uranium illegaly. &gt;Sounds fun as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. &gt;Close Terraria and open Arma 3 &gt;Join the Altis Life server we usualy play on &gt;Spawn in Zaros &gt;I have full rebel gear from the last time that I was on &gt;Had to sneak around to avoid cops but it was night time so it was pretty easy &gt;Go to a car dealership and buy a offroad and speed off to the uranium mine  &gt;When I get there, my two friends are there storing uranium into what appears to be a semi and a van. &gt;The also loaded my truck up as well. &gt;We stock up on repair kits and drive off to the uranium refinery. &gt;Refine all the uranium and then head off to where we need to sell it. &gt;We finally get there &gt;My friend is in the building selling all the uranium. &gt;We ended up with a total of 1.5million dollars that we needed to take to an ATM asap. &gt;The at the topleft corner of my screen i see a message saying 'YOU ARE SURROUNDED, DROP YOUR WEAPONS AND GET DOWN ON THE GROUND OR WE WILL SHOOT' &gt;Battlemode engaged &gt;Look to see who we were dealing with &gt;It's the largest gang in the server with 11 players on with full military grade gear and two military helicopter &gt;All we have at the time was 3 people with bulletproof gear but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ civilian weapons. &gt;A firefight ensues and we end up taken out four of their guys but we all end up dying. &gt;mfw that whole thing start from finish took about 2 hours of time &gt;mfw we lost a potential of 1.5 million dollars. &gt;mfw It was all worth it because Arma 3 is fun as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Seriously, if you want to have a great time with friends(Arma 3 is a game that I would recommend to have atleast 3 people with.) Buy Arma 3 when it goes on sale. But make sure to buy the DLC because most servers use it and you can't join unless you have it. 10/10 seriously one of the best games I have every played (if you're poor you can just get arma 2 and operation arrowhead and get a taste of the arma series before you spend $30 during a sale for a game you may not end up liking.)
367	1	a	This game is like Gravy flavoured Ice Cream, some like it, others love it. If you hate it, go and force feed it to yourself until you're in one of those categories. But seriously, go and try some Gravy flavoured Ice Cream.
369	1	a	i dont own ARMA 3, and iv never played ARMA 3. but yet it lets me review it  trusting game
371	1	a	Arma 3. a completely unique and fun game, giving a huge variety of scenarios, gut wrenching gameplay, with a huge sence of realizm blows COD, Halo, and Battlefield out of the water. I kiss COD, Halo, and Battlefield goodbye. this is Arma. having no same exact mapped mission. with no same exact scenario, with two Gigantic islands, and alot to explore, from controls, to different ways to approach things, everything is so much more realistic to any other first person shooter, for ground gameplay to taking to the skies in an A-10 or Huey attack helo. has so much more to offer. adding underwater combat, volumetric simulation, and Authentic FLIR imaging. gives a experience worth living for, takes the player right into battle at the comfort and warmth of you'r home.  the community is gigantic giving huge amounts of content the community creates for a quick subscribe and free download. giving multiplayer a boost to a stunning 100 player scenarios. goodbye 64 player servers.  and yes. the Arma 3 community has quite a bit to offer.  OPS on ground are stunning. having that adreniline rush of bullets whizzing past you or the curiosity to find where you're getting shot at from. Arma 3 supports a simulated person. not a gun with a hitbox, having 15 different ways to get out of sight. and to return the fire. the ways to call support and the ways to provide it are incredible. there are also many species of wildlife you can run into such as, goats, snakes, bunnies, dragonflies, and butterflies, Arma 3 completely excels on ground ops.  OPS in air arent DCS world realistic, but are still realistic to its point. thanks to volumetric clouds, volumetric fog, and randomized weather chages gives Air OPS a huge advantage and disadvantage in different situations, different vehicles to take flight in means different ways to support squad and teammates in the battlefield. the wildlife here is birds. but flying is fun, yet can be very dangerous, wear you're seatbelts!  OPS in water such as in boats or even diving are both very fun, might as well veetoh COD:GHOSTS fish A.I. a huge veriety of killable wildlife such as eels, fish, seaturtles, and sharks. also with the many different passenger and assult boats. having that ability to choose what kind of vehicle you want can give you the upper hand.  OPS in armor such as tanks, imidiately makes you feel like a badass, rolling through with an M1-Abrahms platformed tank, makes you feel the most powerful thing on the battlefeild, then you have things like a pickup truck with a 50. BMG HMG that seemed good but you got blown up. alot of things have the upper and lower hand, as said many times depending on the situation, but before i let you go, try not to hit the bunnies, what did they do to you...?  Arma 3 has definately alot to look forward to in the up coming years, i hope this review was helpful, and at the same time confirms you to join the Arma 3 community. im not saying too much of everything, so you the reader has to play the game to find out more  but remember.  MAKE ARMA NOT WAR!!!
373	1	a	Watching friends fly helicopters for the first time. 10/10.
375	1	a	I don't even own this game but i can review it 10/10  EDIT: Now i do own the game, and i would say it is a fun and realistic shooter, with a great modding community Still 10/10
377	1	a	The sheer number of Mods and missions available for this game is unbelievable. Great fun on the techie side too can be had hosting a server from GamingDeluxe
379	1	a	I witnessed someone driving a pickup truck, then crashing into a rock and exploding into a fiery hell. 10/10
31	0	a	Let me start by saying that I have had fun with this game, as you can see by my playtime. But that playtime has been plagued by bugs, glitches, low FPS, and a constant feeling of 'Why didn't they...?' in the back of my mind. I never got into ArmA 2 because of its FPS problems, netcode, clunky and unintuitive controls, and just bad game design. ArmA 3 has fixed NONE of these problems.   - First off, the performance. The Real Virtuality engine is an engine from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 18th century being held together with duct tape and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Server performance still affects client performance. This is a joke. If the server gets overloaded, you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s. This is why performance is so inconsistent.  - The player controller is the same one from ArmA 2. This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ controller cannot play more than two animations at once, on the legs and the torso. Full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this. Again, this is a joke. Animations are also very stiff and crappy looking.  - Same old bugs and glitches from ArmA 2 that were never fixed. You can lean into walls and see through them, much worse if you're using 3rd person. Grass pops in right in front of your eyes. Objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you. Vehicle physics are almost non-existent and you will explode from the smallest crash. VOIP is incredibly laggy and sounds like it's coming out of a 90s phone.   - Game is supposed to use DX11 when in reality it still uses mostly DX9, one example is shadows. ArmA 3 still uses â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ stencil shadows instead of soft shadows, even on max settings. Aside from that, visually the game is nothing special. It has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close it's quite ugly. Low res textures are a problem.  - The game is billed as a 'military sandbox' by Bohemia and a 'military simulation' by PC Gamer but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing NOBODY plays it as one. 99% of servers are gamemodes like Wasteland, Epoch, and Altis Life; gamemodes more suited to Grand Theft Auto than a game with as much potential as ArmA 3. Worse still Bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless End Game gamemode that nobody plays. I was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game it's supposed to be, and I played a lot on that server, but the FPS was so bad (~25) that I eventually stopped playing.   - Stemming from the issue above, tactical PvP just isn't a thing. There is some tactical PvE which I have enjoyed playing, but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those Terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a .45, you're out of luck.   - 3rd person. Everyone uses it, or rather abuses it. It's impossible to get the drop on someone in CQC because he's looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person. 'Don't play it', you might say. That's impossible, because I have never seen a public server with it disabled. 'Don't use it', you might say. Again impossible, because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when I come around the corner unless I use 3rd person to look over the wall too.   - Updates are a farce. Game's been out for 2 years and only NOW we're getting bipods, really? The DLC is another joke, 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns, wow Bohemia what a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing deal.   - 'Never half-â™¥â™¥â™¥ two things. Whole-â™¥â™¥â™¥ one thing.' - Ron Swanson. Driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that isn't a flat surface. Plane mechanics are pick-up-and-play. Guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered doesn't happen. The only saving grace is the combined arms aspect, but alone they're terrible to play.   I'm going to stop here because I could go on all day about how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all. I never write long reviews, but how much I love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me. This game is NOT worth 50 euro, maybe 20 at best. The only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game.   The only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it.
381	1	a	Hmmmm... Not entirely sure how to start this review. This the first ARMA game I have played. While the game even now is buggy and glitchy, its still an extremely solid 'soldier' exprience. I love the atmosphere generated through this game and large scale battles which ensue are always a joy. Also the amount of content under the steam workshop will keep you going for hours and hours. As far as 'realistic' shooters go, ARMA 3 is probably one of the best well if you can put the issues with the game aside.  Final Score: 85/100
383	1	a	Great game. Hour-long sessions of:  'Yes, I can hear the gunshots.' 'Yes, I know they're almost hitting us.' 'No, I don't know where they're coming from.'
32	0	a	Game seems fun and with lot of options and great mods, but the optimization is so horrible that i couldn't enjoy it and had to refund. Will buy it if they improve the performance but 3 years after release i doubt it.
385	1	a	If you like taking screenshots, this is the game for you!
387	1	a	Cod = Kids Battlefield = Big boiiz ARMA = MEN
33	0	a	This game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots, but then Bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it. You can find screenshots jam packed with weapons, attachments, camos, characters, and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because Bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development.  That might have been an accpetable option, except Bohemia didn't fully commit. Because of this, a lot of the game is just copy-pasted nonsesne. Almost all vehicles use the same HMGs, GMGs, and auto-cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle. All static weapons such as the mortar, GPMG, and anti-tank/anti-air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions. There's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game, all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety. An example of this is the MX and Katiba. These each have their respective variants in the CQB, regular, grenadier, and DMR roles, but each one of them is the exact same. They have the same ballistics, same damage, same recoil, same magazine capacity (even though the MX has a much longer, thicker mag than the Katiba,) and hell, even the same round!  Take a look back at ArmA II, you'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go, but in ArmA III everything feels the exact same and in MANY cases it IS the exact same. They couldn't add a different auto-cannon for each faction, but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear!  Another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future WITHOUT actually adding any futuristic content. Any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that 'look futuristic.' The Merkava replaces the M1A2 Abrams tank in the least sensible move since Jimmy Carter running for a second term, the Bradley is replaced by the Namer, another Israeli tank, and come to think of it, this entire game is a showcase for Israel. This doesn't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it's spread out amongst all factions, but it made a lot of sense in the original story when Israel was annexed by CSAT and CSAT started using Israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their Soviet-made equipment from yester-year. This is a great example why they should've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game.  When you get down to the core of it all, all that matters is the gameplay. Unfortunately, that is horrendous, too. The game feels like they watched Rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in ArmA II, combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge. Players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying, even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill! Full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you don't you're going to be the one in a body-bag. Seriously, they took a simulator game and turned it into Call of Duty.   The encumberance system is another horrible mess. Seriously, your character is not fit for military shape because he can't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break, and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction, because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to China and is shaking harder than Michael J. Fox with a cold.  Another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is. Seriously, even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and, at times, outright freeze-framing.  All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the ArmA series, because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience.

391	1	a	Better than Arma2, but i miss the old Arma felling.
34	0	a	They keep releasing 15 dollar DLC while many bugs exist from Arma 2 plus more. I cannot reccomend a game that the developers don't want to optimize or bugfix.The developers need to focus on the many optimization issues in multiplayer servers(vanilla multiplayer servers have issues). The game is basically, it runs at 30 FPS on GTX 970 with and I7 processor in basically any vanilla multiplayer server. You phase through walls and your character gets stuck on EVERYTHING. I have 980 hours on ArmA 2 (was a moderator on a server). The game does some improvements over Arma 2, one being the weapon mechanics have been improved a bit. I would only recomend this game on a large sale.
35	0	a	Thank you Bohemia Interactive for confirming my beliefs that you have lost it.  I am not paying $15 for helicopters. Get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.
36	0	a	If you are an Arma fan, this game will change all that.  When you spen 60$ and your computer can't run it, It will be because your computer is crappy. When you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other Arma games, you will be called spoiled. When there is nothing to do offline, no point or story it's because it's still in the works even though it's a full release. When you can't eek out better than 10FPS no matter what your specs, it's because you didn't tweak enough. When you can't find a server to play on it's because you don't know the right clan. When you do get on a server and it lags, greifs and glitches, it's because you play on crappy servers. When you don't think it's realistic, it's not a sim.  When you cant have any shoot'em up fun like BF it's because it is a sim. When all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not Arma3, it's not fair to compare. When you voice any of the above views here or the BI Forums you are a liar.  http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?163875-I-am-a-player-of-BI-games-from-OFP-CWC-Heres-what-I-think 
393	1	a	One of the few pc games that isnt a port, but still feels like one. 10/10
395	1	a	Successfully vaulted my way up a big rock. Shortly after I slid down the rock and fell to my death.  10/10 realistic rock physics.
397	1	a	Its the best computer game in history!!! Arma 3 really sends you to war. it has a big terrains,massive multiplayer mods an thousands of addons that makes it perfect.Just mess with Arma!
37	0	a	Like every Bohemia Interactive's game, it is badly optimized, you need a quantum computer to make it run smoothly at high graphics.  Players, don't be stupid , stop playing the Bohemia Interactive's '30 fps games', so they will start optimizing them a bit more....Jeez...
399	1	a	Amazing Game, you all need to pick this up if you like realistic combat. Harsh for any new player to master but when you get the the feel of the game and master the controls it's great fun!
401	1	a	I remember playing this game after getting a taste of Arma 2 and i was so disappointed. I joined a Invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack AI. I was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. They told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of Arma team play. I joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. If you like millitary tactics and teamplay, Arma is right up your alley. It is not like any of the big fps's out there, you don't feel like a action movie super soldier. You feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. If you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. Nr. one advice.  I watch this every time I wonder why i play arma and I just want more:  http://youtu.be/y8oPEskvSAo 
38	0	a	I just cannot grasp how this game is so popular. I think I am likely missing the aspect of having a large and dedicated team to play it with? I have read that makes it more fun but I am just not much of a pvp person, I have always enjoyed co-op pve and this game does not seem to have enough of that. I was excited when I read about the new Zeus mode and this is what I exclusively tested with my family but it was very limited. Perhaps someday a game like this will enrich us few who enjoy co-op pve play.
403	1	a	Arma 3 is everything that I have ever wanted within a simulation shooter. I purchased it in Alpha and I was completely unaware of the amount of gameplay possibilites! You can go all out and re-create a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout, you could role-play on one of many open world servers, or you could just jump on a CO-OP server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy.. I had never played an Arma game until now and I have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing Arma 3 in Alpha and watching the game progress as it has. You would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale!!! The reason I really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from 'years ago'. Those games being 'Choplifter', Arma 3 has an AMAZING 3D Version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fuel/damage/ammo...ah, so good. The first game I played, some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper, and as we arrived to the LZ I heard the pilot say, 'Good Luck guys', and I was completely blown away!! I thought that it was an AI pilot! The second, 'Black Hawk Down' for pc from like 99', the PVP is so much similar but way better. Last but not least, 'Battlezone2', that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base. I recommend finding a community as soon as you get into Arma 3, you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world. Arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects, a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes, and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the Steam community. More friends more fun..... WIN WIN! And the Mods! End of Story..... See you in the battle soldiers! Be sure to get it before 2015 rolls around, 'Make Arma Not War' is going to add so much and I have high hopes for the future of Arma 3.
405	1	a	Buy this game and download Breaking point mod. So fu*king epic!! Just love it!
407	1	a	Best military simulation game there is in my opinion. Specially when you playing with a unit or big group  10/10
409	1	a	How i played this game : 1: Learn how to pilot a helicopter gg 2: Buy a Jet for the first time 3: Do backflips and sideflips 4: Crash into a wire 5: The jet explodes and the wire is fine 6: Disconnect and join another server 7: Find a squeaker, kidnapp him and take all his gear. 8: Tell him to stay in the field and we wont hurt him 9: Get into a helicopter, shoot him down and fly off 10: Feel bad, go back to pick him up 11: Get shot down with a tank 12: Get banned for killing him because he was an admin  10/10 would get banned by a squeaker again 
411	1	a	BESTEST GAME EVER SINCE BATTLEFIELD2!  yes, I said it =) If you played BF2 and you loved it, but hated all its successors... Arma3 is the deal. This game is what should`ve followed BF2, it`s pure, awesome, tough and unforgiving warfare. It`s NOT made for easy (or rather noobish) play, you can`t run for a mile and expect to be able to shoot straight the instance you stop running; you can`t either fly your AttackHelicopter slamming into trees and buildings along the way and expect to be alive... ArmA does not do that, you die, you get hurt, in any case, you do stupid stuff... you will pay for it.  It`s a Mil-Sim, not an Arcade-Shooter like all the other 'tripleA' titles out there:  you want a challenge? - get ArmA3! you want realistic movement? - get ArmA3! you want realistic weaponshandling? - get ArmA3! you want honest (!) and hard working developers? - get ArmA3! you want a game with HUNDREDS (or more) mods to chose from as you like? - get ArmA3! you want your own skill to be the baseline on how your play has influence on the battle/game? - get ArmA3!  By all the good stuff mentioned, it`s only fair to tell about bad/unfortunate things Arma3 offers: This game needs a good CPU, not an ok one, a good CPU... and a fair amount of tweaking to get it run somewhat smoothly. And for MultiPlayer: Client`s performance is dependant on Server`s performance, you can have a beast computer, but if the server you play on sucks, your fps will suck aswell. You`ll have to learn this game before you can be really good at it...  and then when you`re good, Arma3 is deeply satisfying.  Just for personal comparison:  I now have more hours of Arma3 playtime (1500h+), than ALL hours of ALL Battlefields I`ve played over the years combined! Thats the message, yes =)  AND IT DOESNT GET BORING YET!!!
413	1	a	Arma 3 is awesome, even the fact this game isnt so intense like all these these cods and battlefields. At this point we don't have to wait for more tanks and jets, you can get them from armaholic! The movements of the characters are just more than good. Fortunately BIS said goodbye to Arma 2 physics and introduced more realistic engine. I would recommend this game for all who want to feel more reality than in battlefield or call of duty series. Everything you need its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing beast computer.
415	1	a	After playing many hours on  ArmA III , from a realistic perspective and a fun one; it is a great experience for anyone who loves  military simulators  [en.wikipedia.org] . The game is divded into several categories if you will: Infantry, Airborne, Waterborne, Artillery, Armoured, Mechanized and HQ - it covers all of the basics (plus advanced) on the battlefield allowing for a varied approach to the game itself. Personally, I prefer being behind a console managing UAVs/UGVs! The successor of ArmA II has certainly taken on the role of 'NEXTGEN' and demolished competition such as America's Army and DCS World.  The  RV4 Engine  [arma3.com]  is used for DayZ Standalone and ArmA 3 thus far. Though DayZ developers have recently announced the change of their [heavily] modified engine, it really brings the ambience and full graphical effect of ArmA III to life. The detail of graphical texturing is one thing that appealed to me the most. In the majority of games I have experienced during my past, graphical texturing has always been a problem in games such as Call of Duty, (some) Battlefield games and even ArmA II. The level of immersion when experiencing the fidelity of ArmA III is insanely good.  Pros: Â» Detailed, well researched factions which integrate with some fictional factors: CSAT, NATO, FIA, Guerillas and even civilians. Â» Realistic sound effects for particular weapons, majority of them being rifles and pistols. Â» Ability to perform one of many roles: armour, infantry, etcetera. Â» Well established storyline for the campaign: even split into acts for more development time. Â» Realistic factors such as the attention to detail on the IFV-6c Panther - when moving over rough terrain, there are flaps on the side of the tracks that raise as it would interact with the physics in the world. Excellent detail! Â» Generally great game to play. Â» ...Many, many more.  Cons: Â» Ladders are extremely buggy. Climbing thin air is a thing once at the top of the ladder. Â» Artificial Intelligence needs a rework. Their reactions are not quick enough and are heavily delayed when reacting. Earlier today I told my men to hold fire yet they continued, even when disengaged. Â» No built-in immersive radios. External mods required: Task Force Arrowhead Radio, ACRE, etcetera. Â» Although one of the factions are based on NATO, it is all American equipment and characters - voice acting is American for example. Â» Editing a custom mission is impossible unless you have external modifications. Â» Animations in general could do with a bit of a rework.  Overall, I would rate the game about 8/10 simply based on my hours within ArmA III. I played the alpha and the beta and it has come a long way since. It was great to be a part of that development process and I am glad I bought the game early. Really excellent game! I love it!
417	1	a	This is a great game with a lot of flexibility and potential for player development. A realistic military simulation game with many great mods and a very active community.
419	1	a	-joins wasteland -team kill  -he reports me -i have to say sorry if not i will get ban -dont know how to talk in game -get 4 days ban 10/10
421	1	a	I've never encountered a better military simulation game. It goes beyond 'shooter' when played with a good realism cooperative group, with some good missions. Excellent title.
423	1	a	Cannot and will not stop playing. Logged over 850 hours and still going strong. The game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking Bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form Arma 2 or Ones that are completely new come onto the scene. With all the current DLC and the Marksman DLC on its way plus the winners of Make Arma Not War announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in. Whether its life you're into, base building on Wasteland/Epoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on King Of The Hill, If zombies is your thing try Breaking Point (These being the most popular) , If you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong.   But i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25(from personal experience). There are many forums with tips, tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your Arma experience. It may take a little bit of time but it is worth it.
425	1	a	Take Arma 2, fix the bugs, give it some of the best graphics in gaming, and you get Arma 3, once more modders get stuck into this game it will be a must have for sure.
44	0	a	Could be probably the best tactical first person shooter ever. But it won't, because developers keep on ignoring community regarding the frames per second issue. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Bohemia and your stupid DLC's.
427	1	a	I like it, wish it was more popular
429	1	a	10/10 just for the new sounds alone. this game just gets better and better.
431	1	a	Over 200 hours for me. Thumbs up.
433	1	a	Smashed into a sign with a military truck, broke everything  11/10 Would eat nachos with.
435	1	a	How to play: -Spawn in on altis life -buy a prius -drive 50 miles north to cocaine fields -get cocaine -drive to process cocaine -sell cocaine -get cash -drive 100 miles rebel outpost -buy megaguns and ammo -go to airstrip -GET EARRAPED BY 4 WARTHOGS -get a helicopter -go to Kavala -try to bandit -get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by the local police -die -disconnect -quit -open up gta5  9/10   
437	1	a	Very good game won't regret buying it. So many good mods, currently most time played on this game out of all my steam games.
439	1	a	if you re looking for style, this is the right game for you. Excellent bullet balistic, realistic gameplay and also customer friendly company :)
441	1	a	Arma Altis Life and City Life = No Social Life. kek Top mods in this game.
443	1	a	Updated engine with a hell of a lot of potential. Buy it as a long term investment.
445	1	a	Even if its not on sale, probably one of the best games on the market. Infinite replay value. Must have.
447	1	a	Launch goats to space with huge amounts of Explosives. 10/10.
449	1	a	Um so to get this start.  â€¢ Massive Desync  â€¢ More Desync  â€¢ Lets throw in some lag  â€¢ Your friends offroad just decided to fly  â€¢ FPS drop  â€¢ Shotty Hitboxes  â€¢ They â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the sounds so now every gun sounds like a BB gun and you can't tell which direction the incoming fire is.  â€¢ Third looking over a wall to find your target in a military realism simulator  â€¢ Apparently the entire maps of Altis and Statis are quarries cause thats the only reason I can think of why there is a minefield of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing large rocks scattered every 50m.  â€¢ Please don't make us pay 16$ for every new scatterbug dlc idea you guys come up with.  â€¢ Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ does 5 feet fall kill me and why havn't the developers fixed this issue that has plagued the past 2 games?  â€¢ Why do I phase into rocks when I try to walk on them and why do I have to vault to get past a tree?  â€¢ Your car is made out of carboard.  â€¢ 3=============&gt;~~~~~~~~  â€¢ One last thing... More desync  10/10 Welcome to FPS HELL
451	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game but isn't as good as Arma 2 (In my opinon)  This game has lot's of bugs and glitches. Arma 3 looks good but it needs a great PC to run smoothly.  Sa-matras wasteland is amazing and I'd recommend it
453	1	a	Buy this If you like Military action that is more realistic than the run of the mill shooter. ARMA has almost everything you want in a game. Action, suspense, easy to learn hard to master and Explosions.  CONs: Clunky UI Bad performance on low end system Slow actions in game such as drawing your weapon or putting a wounded soldier you are carrying down.) Enough Button keybinds to make you go Blind  PROs: The modding community The Multiplayer The Communaty in general. So many Cars, Tanks, Jets and Choppers all of them are driveable. Want to lead a squad of players on a mission to retake a City? - ARMA has you covered Want to fly other guys to and from the fight or provide close air support? - ARMA has you covered Want to setup challenges create missions or even run a game of your friends live provideing obstacles and enemy encounters on the fly? - ARMA has you covered  This game is awesome, and the multiplayer is what makes this game so good. A Few Examples of mods that I play ALOT: King Of The Hill by Sa-Matra - Three Player Factions Fight for a City using every tool at their disposal. DOMINATION: A Commander directs troops, and guides Squads of players on missions against AI, that pop up accross the map. EXILE: Every man for himself - Make money on mission or hunting players and get better gear.  I Love this game PS. There is a go cart addon where you drive gocarts. I dont know why, but there is :-D
455	1	a	The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands. With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized.
457	1	a	You can fight war without clothes on; Explosions everywhere; Destroy pretty much any vehicle with fences; Desync. galore!  What's not to love about this game! 
459	1	a	Lets put it this way. The game is exelent. The only thing i dont like is the fact that it takes about 3 bullets in the brain to kill someone.
461	1	a	Takes some practice to be good at this, and a lot more practice to work tactically as a team, But nothing is more rewarding than moving fluidly as a unit and getting things done without losing a single teammate. Once you get the tactics down you will then be able to fully enjoy this game. 8/10
463	1	a	Got 15 FPS to listen to two people scream at new players while we made a tactical blob of human bodies and drowned the enemy in our own corpses.  10/10 best Napoleanic war simulator.
465	1	a	I haven't met any Russians in this game yet 10/10
467	1	a	One of the best simulation Game great ambient so immersive &amp; the other Mod just special i recomanded Battle Royal , you need absolutly try this mod incredible experiences..
469	1	a	Download enough mods and it starts to get good again.
471	1	a	When I first got it, I was disappointed. But after discovering the vast amount of mods and customization with the editor, I haven't stopped playing. 9.5/10
473	1	a	The ultimate military simulator that you can actually afford. Highly customizable but comes with a learning curve. Has a lively public community in the forms of Altis Life roleplay or instant-action King of the Hill, but for the real experience you should find a clan or community to play missions with.
49	0	a	Terrible optimization for AMD cpus's doesnt matter what GPU you have I struggle to have a stable 30 fps without turning everything off   Rig gpu-gtx 980 cpu-fx 8350 ram-8gb
475	1	a	Its ok
50	0	a	Gonna start off by saying the game itself is great. The series is moving in the right direction. Or so i thought.  Developers, not just BIS, are only out for money these days. I started to love ARMA 3 then i see the ridiculous dlc attached to this game. Who in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thought it would be a good idea to create a couple of helicopters and some sniper rifles and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pawn them off to the community.   Are we gonna get to a point where games companies create a shell of a game and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sell the sky as dlc? or each individual vehicle THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME FROM THE START!!!  Are we already there?
477	1	a	I picked this game up when it first came out and have spent tons of time playing it since then. As with all the previous Arma series it has its problems (most of which I believe, should have been fixed before being sold to the public), but even with its faults it is still the closest thing to a real infantry simulator that a non-military person can purchase. With mods the game gets even better and more playable, and less 'sci-fi' like. Also, I've never played any of the single player stuff that comes with the game, I only do multiplayer with my group and I really enjoy it. Things to watch out for; you need a fast processor for this game - DO NOT buy it if your CPU isn't over 3.5 M. All of the Arma games are CPU intensive and this one is the worst for it. Don't expect it to be easy - this isn't Call of Duty or some other 'fps' that has the AI standing around waiting for you. They'll hide, shoot at distance and even chase you around. Use real-world tactics, if you're with friends, and see how well they work (they do), think 'stay alert' and you'll survive longer. There's loads of stuff I could say about this game, but really I play it for about 20 hours or so a week and really enjoy it.
479	1	a	This game offers a lot. And I mean A LOT. You can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. Or you could roleplay and buy an ATM from all the drug money you earned in Altis Life. Or have races with friends in Karts. This game is an Army Simulator, but it's great for modding which let's you do more things.  Now, this game isn't something like COD or Battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. If you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. Although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. Please don't think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. It takes skill.  Altis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. There is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. There is also Stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than Altis.   You need a good PC to run this game. I usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it.  Overall, this game has a ton of things to do and you can't get bored of it. I give it a 9.5/10
481	1	a	Probably the closest thing that us, the general population, has towards a realistic military simulator/game.  I suggest that you do not buy this if you are expecting a linear fast paced action game like CoD or Battlefield, this is much more in-depth then that. This is not simply, running around 360 no scoping people. Squad Managment and effective communication is necessary. There is also something that you can't experience in the said titles above, which is long-range combat.  (An example of this is preforming an assault on a base/camp with armor, artillery and other assests from varying distances from your own base.  However, this is still a game and should be taken lightly from time to time. I suggest learning how to do tricks in the littlebird (MH9-Hummingbird) and exploiting the terrible physics.   This game has multiple different gamemodes and tasks that could be simulated. So you'll never have the same experience twice.   Pros: -Very Realistic. -Great Graphics (If you can run them). -Interactive Environment. -Realisitc Vehicals (Most of the time). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cons: -Physics (You will hear 'Arma Physics' referred to multiple times). -Muliplayer Optimization. -Very steep learning curve but you will appreciate it over time. (More of a learn as you play) -Occasional Crashing. -Controls will more than likely conflict your normal keyboard setup, I suggest using the Arma 2 setup.   Overall 10/10  Even if you don't think this is for you, trust me, the teamwork involved in this game is beyond amazing, the amount of co-op I've played counts for 95% of my game time. I've met tons of new people from this and they're like family to me.

NPCs are broken dev plz fix.  10/10 ign  UPDATE DECEMBER 6TH 2016: 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny ^I'm not joking that's what it actually says^ My Specs: FX 8350, gtx 1050ti SC, 16gb of ram. Don't buy this game when it's $39.99, buy it when it's on sale for $19.99. It's a great game by itself but it's more fun if you have mods like exile, breaking point, or arma 3 life as they have many more servers and are way more fun. Campaign is slow at points, but has a better storyline than most other armas. Amazing graphics. NPC are still broken. One other thing about this game is that the updates make some mods bug, and not function, and the mods are what keeps the game alive, so if you have mods that are not working, you should go into properties and revert to an older version of arma to get them working again.
51	0	a	I gave this a shot over the free weekend and here's what I learned:   1. You need an incredibly modern and powerful gaming PC to run attractive graphics with this. My system is 5 years old, 570 GTX can barely run this at the lowest graphics settings possible, and that's barely getting 30 fps.   2. The amount of key mapping you need to do to make this even somewhat manageable as a 'game' is insane. Basically, you need one of those 7 or 9 button gaming Mice, because you won't have enough sensible keyboard key locations to cover all of the crap.   3. For a game where voice communication is extremely necessary, the voice comm functionality in this game is quite limited, but that's not really an issue because everyone is going to be using TS3 anyway...   4. Good luck finding a decent server to play on. Most of them are run by fascist bronys. Others are run by incompetent admins and you can count on getting spawnkilled by your own team over and over until you leave and find a different server. No, I'm not kidding.   5. The game isn't worth 60 dollars. The rest of the game (that's right, you don't actually get the whole game for 60 dollars, you need all of the DLC too because the only good weapons are locked) is going to run you even more. So it's over $100 game that isn't worth playing unless you have a $2,500 computer and a $120 mouse.   6. It seems like, if you met all of the requirements above, the game *could* be enjoyable. Just know what you are really getting yourself into...  
485	1	a	Early into the game, I noticed a few problems. The graphics are a little dated, but hold up overall. The big problem I see, is with the constant fadeout to FMV. This seems to occur so frequently throughout the Prologue, I began wondering what the point of the game actually was. I get it, that this was a tutorial phase; However, I could do with less fadeaway's and more actual gameplay. With the Con's out of the way, I like the realistic feel to the game, from the weaponry and equipment, to the military jargon, it has an air of authenticity, which makes these types of games appealing to many. Arma 3, may have it's flaws, but overall it isn't a bad game. If I were in charge, I would have modernized the graphics a bit, and put a greater emphasis on the smaller details such as battlefield damage to structures and the environment, the movement of the weeds, grass and tree's in the wind, and other little things to enhance the immersion experience. Still a recommendable game for those interested in Army Warfare Sims.

487	1	a	Adolf Hitler (German: [ËˆadÉ”lf ËˆhÉªtlÉ]; 20 April 1889 â€“ 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as FÃ¼hrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.  Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.  Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support.  Hitler actively sought Lebensraum ('living space') for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.
489	1	a	Excellent military sim engine with a huge pool of mods to create just about any mission or situation you can imagine.
491	1	a	The game is good . A great simulator of hostilities . Lots of possibilities. Good graphics . Good dynamics of the game. Sounds for 10 points. A kind of atmosphere is present when you play multiplayer with friends.
493	1	a	If you've looked at this on the Steam shelf and even been slightly interested, buy it.   Apart from the gorgeous graphics and highly detailed soldiers, weapons, vehicles and environments, it gives you an experience like no other shooter.  Best of all, it uses the Steam workshop which means you can very easily download (in-game) scenarios that other players have made. This offers an eternal level of replayability.
495	1	a	this is realy a good game there are enough modde't servers to play on you will find something you like
497	1	a	Not much to say appart that this game Rocks! its a learning process but fun as hell all the way. GJ on that one Bohemia.  Ps srr for the Bad english.
499	1	a	a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do I need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and 'survival of the fittest'!; if you're the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you!  so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, it's very own realism and it's not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel)  10/10 would buy again
501	1	a	Cod is for kids Battlefield is for teens  Arma is for MEN!!!
503	1	a	Fantastic game that still required a little rounding around the edges. One of, if not the best gaming communities who I hope will remain healthy and keep providing solid material.
505	1	a	Have barely played much of the game at all really, yet I feel it could be very promising.  Definitely recomend so far, will report back once I have played a sufficient ammount of gameplay to adequately say I have experienced all of the avalible gameplay (I estimate I am only 1/10th of the way there thusfar).
507	1	a	This game is one of the best Military Simulators ever! Set in the future with the Nato Forces, CSAT Forces, AAF Forces and Guerilla Forces and with the massive community you can do amazing things with friends or on multiplayer servers! I recommend this game 10/10 Best Arma game yet.
509	1	a	An amazing game that has you hooked for many hours as your explore the campaign and the many DLCS and multiplayer mods that are on offer.
511	1	a	One of my favorite games on steam, from Arma 1 until now, money well spent.
513	1	a	One of the best games ever got alot of hours on it
515	1	a	If you love Arma II you're going to love Arma III. They improve on a lot of the functionality of the game. Very smooth experience and multiplayer is very fun and challenging.
517	1	a	Such an amazing game. Definitely without a doubt the premier modern era FPS. Some amazing clans/communities as well.
519	1	a	Bullets actually hurt you. 10/10
521	1	a	Fantastic game already! Everything I wanted improved from ARMA and ARMA2 is improved in ARMA3 Alpha. The controls, animations and movement is sooo much better now, not clunky and meh like previous games in the series.  Yet it still keeps that great realism that we love the series for. It is in great shape so far for an alpha version. Cannot wait to see what the full version offers! How did they get it to run better and look better than ARMA2? Pretty impressive!  Get it now, maybe see ya online!  **Years later, End of Feb, 2016 and the game is vastly improved in many ways. One of the best shooters of all time imo, so much to do in this game and so many options, from online games like Altis Life, Breaking Point and Battle Royale. I have over 200 hours on this game now and I am sure many more in the future**
523	1	a	There is a Soviet joke from early 80s that goes like this:  Moscow, summer morning, Sheremetyevo airport.  A representative of some very successful Japanese tech corporation heads back to his homeland after an official visit to USSR during which he observed the technological feats of Soviet people. Of course, a huge delegation of Party leaders and reporters is present, just like during any other event of this sort. So, as he walks to his plane, he becomes surrounded by reporters and they ask him, 'What have you liked the most about Soviet Union?'. â€” You have great children, they're so playful, happy and optimistic about their future. â€” Awesome! - reporters reply - and have you liked anything else? â€” You have great children. â€” Yeah, we love our children too, but what about our cars and TVs and fridges and roads and other things? â€” You have great children - the representative replies - but everything you make with your hands is terribly bad.  So, Arma series has a really great community. An amazing one, really. I'm thoroughly convinced that no other game has a similar one. But everything made by Bohemia Interactive...  Well, it's not exactly  terribly  bad (and at times it's quite good actually) but Arma, in a way, carries the spirit of Soviet Union's industry: a single manufacturer that gets most of its revenue from excellent military products also produces various civilian goods. These goods, however, while being suitable for their purpose, have a mediocre quality, especially compared to the products of Western companies. But it's the only manufacturer in the country and the Iron Curtain is still in place so you don't really have a choice but to recommend these products to your family and friends.  You really like that Mercedes-Benz W123? Well, too bad, here's a ticket for UAZ-496, comrade.   You're #47,254,875 in the queue.  
56	0	a	Too many lies.
525	1	a	 If you are looking for a shooter equal to Call of Duty or Battlefield, you have definitely come to the wrong place. This game is not about kills and superior aim - it's all about tactics and coordination.
527	1	a	Haven't played much of the base game, but Altis life is addictive as hell and well worth the money.
529	1	a	Best military simulation game out here. 10/10
531	1	a	One of the best military games available. Its sandbox style and modding/customizations allow it to become almost anything you want. Co-operative military simulator, role-playing game, survival horror, you name it. It offers so many possibilities it has an endless replay value. What this game is to me is a military simulator, it has a numerous amount of upgrades from the previous Arma 2/Op. Arrowhead, most importantly the infantry handling and animations that now offer much more flexibility and greater control over your character. Vehicles none the less have been upgraded, the new PhysX 4 engine gives vehicles a much more realistic feeling. Lights and scenario rendering have been not only upgraded, but made even LIGHTER for your pc to run, as opposed to the incredibly heavy Arma 2 engine that would put an incredible amount of stress even to the most high-end gaming rigs. The downside however is that as of now the game doesn't offer much sandbox content as in vehicles and weapons but the developers have already announced future free DLCs that would address this and add some other cool features.  In conclusion i think this game offers infinite possibilities to those who can take advantage of them but it still needs some time to grow and reach its full potential, what we'll have then will be a game that is going to put to shame all the other commercial FPSs.
533	1	a	ARMA 3 makes me feel like i'm actually a soldier, carrying out objectives and operations like a soldier too instead of this hyper-active nonsensual chaos that is Call of Duty and Battlefield.  If you're a fan of ARMA or just hardcore games in general i seriously recommend this. Bohemia once again succeeds at delivering, improved AI and voice acting, stunning graphics and whole new arsenal of semi-futuristic guns, gadgets and vehicles that are sure to impress.   Step into a world where one shot is all that is needed, where teamwork truly is important...
535	1	a	I have around 500 hours in Arma 3 at the time of writing this review.  Arma 3 is both epic, and hugley frustrating for me.  EPIC - as a military sim, it is outstanding. We heavily mod the game to our 'light' milsim requirements and frankly im blown away with how good things can be.  FRUSTRATING - I have to have a few good friends do all the work preparing our missions, sorting our mod packs. I simply can't do it technically. Lucky I have some great friends, but it's alot of work for them (but it keeps them off the streets eh.........)  The more standard mod's wasteland, exile, king of the hill etc are real fun if thats your thing.  Be prepared to be immersed and have a blast with Arma 3!
537	1	a	*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*  This is one of the best Strategy Action Simulators i have played since ArmA II. Looks beautiful if you have top range PC. One Downside is that it is highly intensive on your CPU and I cannot recommend this for low end computers/laptops. You never run out of things to do, due to the Steam Workshop and Level Editor where many people create great game types and areas for combat.  I give a 9/10
57	0	a	ArmA2 has much more content and is far more realistic (only medic can heal and it takes a while, weapons acting as real life counterparts, in ArmA3 everything is 'balanced' and you can self-heal in 3 seconds by clicking a proper button). ArmA2 has also more vehicles, more weapons, more everything... really, there is nothing to go for ArmA3 except a bit better graphic, but this is hardly anything important, especially because ArmA2 looks not much worse.   Moreover it's been over three months since the release date and the game still has unfinished campaign and terrible AI bugs. You don't have to take my word for it, watch a video:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=178199064 
58	0	a	WIth the latest awful patch, it is usually impossible to connect in hosted MP. 1/3 of missions that we actually get playing soon drop to 1 FPS, requiring a restart. The devs ignore these issues.  Other issues:    Spyware!   Endless bugs   New bugs every patch   Terrible performance   The developers don't care about the game   Constantly drops to 1 FPS (devs refuse to address this)   Latest patch randomly kicks/prevents joining servers (devs refuse to address this)   Broken AI   Broken features   100% reliant on 3rd party mods for bugfixes, playability and content   Arma 2 offers more for less  I have over 2000 hours in Arma 3 alone, more in the other entries in the series. I have been modding and making missions since the early 2000s. I am the guy who introduced dynamic missions and campaigns to the series. That said, Arma 3 is not worth your money.  Arma 3 is basically a patch of OFP, a game that came out in 2001. The graphics are better, there are new scripting commands and the inventory system is better, but those are the only real improvements. In recent patches BIS finally implemented weapon resting (something modders had in Arma 2 years ago), but it is clumsy and poorly-implemented. The modded solutions are vastly superior.  Every patch for Arma 3 is a disaster. What is broken this time? What features have stopped working? What mods are broken now? Will my performance get worse again?  The latest patch has broken MP. My coop group can not join missions now, despite our modset being identical. Sometimes after trying to join over and over it will let players in. Then when we restart the mission it won't let people join. Last time we played it took over an hour of disabling mods and endless retries before we could play a single mission. It seems the devs are cracking down on mods.  Even the bugs are broken. Often bugs happen randomly and in a non-reproducable way. Sometimes the AI driver won't follow movement orders, sometimes he will. There is no pattern.  A big problem is that control of your AI squadmates is much worse than previous games. In OFP your could use tactical view to position your guys, tell them to hold fire and they would do it. This made it possible to set up ambushes. In Arma 3 this is impossible. Your AI will often not move to where you click on the map. A very common occurence is to order your squad to a position 100 meters behind you and they will instead move 100 meters in front.  Friendly AI struggle to engage enemy targets. Countless times I have seen my troops blankly staring down their sights at an enemy for several seconds, finally getting shot instead. In contrast, the enemy can still do a first-shot head-shot over iron sights from 200 meters away, something people complained about in 2001.  AI squadmates are little more than extra lives in coop. At least the needless respawn delay has finally been removed.  Another bug is when your squad takes fire, they will enter combat mode and you can't get them out of it. They become unresponsive to commands and are out of your control. This makes it impossible to break contact or dash to a new position. In other words, when you take fire, you lose control of your squad. This can be fixed with mods, but not in vanilla. Again, modders save the day because the devs don't care.  If you are a group commander in a vehicle but switch to gunner and then exit the vehicle, the vehicle driver will run over you. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It is things like this that make me think the devs never even play their game.  That said, enemy AI is improved over OFP. However, the AI still requires mods do basic things like enter buildings, take cover, call for support, crew weapons etc.  AI are even less capable of driving than previous games. I made a mission where the enemy starts in a village and spreads out from there, seizing the map town by town. However, I noticed that a few minutes after spawning, the enemy technical groups slowed down greatly. When I used a camera view to debug, I saw that most of the AI had crashed their vehicles so badly (whilst safe and driving down empty roads), that they had wrecked the vehicles in their group and were now on foot.  Let that sink in. The AI can not drive down roads for a few kilometers without wrecking their vehicles, even when not in combat.  The implementation of PhysX is terrible and often slows the game to a crawl or crashes it. About one in three coop games requires a restart because a vehicle gets stuck on a building and the FPS hits 4. You will also see hilarious glitches like tanks suddenly flying into the air for no reason.  The worst thing about Arma 3 is that the developers just don't care. They ignore major bugs, but then implement rubbish that nobody wants. So now there is Workshop integration (who cares?), but you still can't control your troops in combat.  Despite existing in earlier games, there are no females in Arma 3. So what do the devs give us? Go karts! It is absurd.  The action menu was terrible when OFP was released in 2001, and Bohemia has made no efforts to improve it. For those not familiar with it, you have to use the middle mouse button to control essential actions. Say you want to climb a ladder, you might accidentally set off your satchel charges instead. Or a single mis-click and you turn off your helicopter's engine. There are several mods which show how this could be done better, but again, the devs don't care.  A great point is the modding community. There are tons of fantastic mods that add units, islands, functions and fix Bohemia's shoddy work.  People will tell you that Arma 3 is some super-realistic military simulation. It has realistic elements, but it also has magic medkits that instantly heal you. The tanks are STILL using a hitpoint system and can be killed with any weapon as long as you hit it enough times. Also, tanks still do stupid things like get into combat, inexplicably expose their rear armor to the enemy and then use their coax to engage an MRAP whilst ignoring some AFV that is shooting them.  The artillery system is a joke. Some of the special round types (eg. guided shells) don't work at all.  The naval aspect is a gimmick with zero value in the game. There are no true naval assets, the aquatic elements serve absolutely no purpose and are useless in game.  In those rare cases when it all comes together, nothing breaks and you are fighting the enemy instead of the game engine, Arma 3 can offer an amazing experience like no other game. But you will need to spend dozens of hours researching and installing mods and learning how to avoid the bugs. Arma 3 is broken and unfinished, you will have to invest a lot of time to make it work for you. Vanilla offers a boring, unpolished, unfinished experience. Every patch will require more hours of troubleshooting before you can play smoothly again.  If you really want to see what Arma has to offer, just get Arma 2 and its addons. It is much cheaper, has about 500% of the content of Arma 3, is more stable and has far more mods. In fact one of the major modding projects for Arma 3 is to import Arma 2 content. Arma 2 has far more islands and factions. You will not have to deal with all of the bugs Arma 3 introduces.  Some fanboys will attack this review. But I have been contributing to OFP/Arma community for over a decade. I am sick of waiting for Bohemia to take their game seriously and fix the bugs. It seems all they care about now is Life game modes.  I could go on and on. One final bug: the one where you suddenly start flapping your arms and floating in the air like a bird.  Bottom line: Arma 3 is definitely not worth the money. Arma 2 can provide more than Arma 3 at a much lower cost and with less bugs. Even if you get Arma 3 for free, you will have to invest a lot of time and effort into it to make it playable. Even then, sometimes it will simply not let you join a server.
539	1	a	ARMA 3 is a game in a class of its own and defines the genre of tactical military simulations. One of the greatest benefits is the modability and vast amount of user created content, that can be implemented in this very open sandbox. The first part of the campaign 'Survive' showed that Bohemia Interactive made their game also interesting for singleplayer, but the true strength of ARMA 3 is for sure the multiplayer.  Don't get me wrong - this game needs a certain level of dedication to get the maximum out of it, casual players probably won't get happy. If you want a unique mod- and mission-setting you cannot just create a game and simply 'hop in'. Hosting a MP-server with mods, creating MP-missions that work flawless with mods - all of this stuff can be quite complex and hard to be learned by one person alone. But if you decide to join a group or community that suites your style of play (action-, hardcore-simulation-, roleplay-orientated or somewhere in between) then you might get a most interesting and challenging game experience.
541	1	a	Arma 3 Is a  Amazing Game . Its makes you really think when you are in gunfight, but sadly it has a huge learning curve. This game isn't for someone who doesn't want to feel their heart beating quicker than they have ever felt it, but it is for the adrenaline junkie. Mods/Workshop items for this game greatly improve it, and without a shadow of a doubt, i would reccomend this game to ANYBODY who loves tactical/realistic shooters.
543	1	a	Great game just please keep adding more vehicles :D &lt;3 &lt;3 
545	1	a	Its like skyrim with cops 10/ign
547	1	a	So, I am changing this review after serious serious SERIOUS play time. To be honest, the full game doesn't offer much content, it does offer much better mechanics though, its very in-depth and can be fun for a long time. But after a while all the cool stuff fades away, and it begins to turn into a boring war sim. I love ArmA. It is my most played series aside from PAYDAY. But I feel like I can't love it anymore, in my opinion I give this game a 7 out of 10. Because the time I had with it was great. The unbiased opinion of this is a 9 out of 10. Because of how everything works together, the only problems is how bad the online is, you drop frames due to CONNECTION ISSUES. Thx bohemia, volvo pls fix. I say its worth 30 dollars
60	0	a	Before you decide to downvote this review because its a negative recommendation, Please read. There are positive things about this game if you take your time to read this and/or the comments Ive posted below.  Bohemia have gone down hill, even if their game has enhanced somewhat, its not worth anywhere near the price they sell it at and the fact that you have to pay for small updates they call DLC's is disgusting, I completley regret buying this game, we've payed a bunch of greedy frauds.  The modding community could do better and their downloads are free. This is both disrespectfull to the average player and the modding community. Its like a 'Go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself' outlook on the whole consumer market of ARMA titles.  Whilst I used to be a follower of ARMA titles, I refuse to accept the fact that bohemia are too ignorant to pay some kind of respect to the community, its beginging to look like a move EA would pull. -Youve brought our game for a overly-expensive amount of money and now that we release content that should have been present in the ALPHA version is now being released late so we can rip you off even more then we did before.  This has completley ruined the positive vibes that I once had for Bohemia. Disgracefull.
549	1	a	This is the definitive military experience, sure it might be rough around the edges and maybe it can be a bit unforgiving at times, but no other military shooter out there comes even close to what ARMA 3 offers, unlimited replayability, thousands of campaigns and scenarios, mods, coop, vehicles, exploration, and above all a sense of total inmersion.  With the upcoming free dlc, and a huge community behind it, Bohemia interactive have again struck gold, having played their games since Operation Flashpoint, it has been an awesome surprise to see how far they have taken the genre forward, although, be advised, Call of Warfare fans will be in for a shock as nothing they have learnt there will have much use in here!  The graphics are amazing, the movement and controls are the best in the series, but be advised, you will have to take time to learn the ins and outs of the game, as it is sometimes unforgiving of even the slightest mistakes, eventually you get the hang of it and this game really shines!  Must buy! Get your gun soldier and hit the dirt!
551	1	a	At first I was very skeptical about Arma III. Playing Arma II was not such a pleasant experience, and I was very happy that I haven't wasted my money on this when the Day Z mod came out, So I bought Arma III expecting something as bad as the previous Arma. But I was surprised. The graphics, movement, squad management, driving and many other features were massively improved. I`m not even talking about shooting. Recoil and gun damage is so realistic. But the inventory system probably is the most improved thing since Arma II. Now you can easily see whats on the ground, or in the vehicle, or simply add attachments for your gun ( which are awesome! ). There`s no more arrow clicking and usual inventory lag. The only things that needs fixing are glitches and AI. Glitches should be fixed in future patches, but the AI need some work done. The AI could be both very easy to take down and extremely punishing at the same time. Sometimes AI just stands there for couple of seconds and then starts shooting, or instantly spots you and shoots you down in a few shots. I think Bohemia Interactive should really focus on this problem, because its not so serious as it is irritating, All in all, if you want some new experience of shooting game that requests some planing, patience and cooperation instead of 'being your own little Rambo', you definitely should check out Arma III.
61	0	a	Just don't buy this game, horrible ui, horrible optimization, lack of post processing, commanding troops is a huge pain they dont think for themselves you have to micro manage everything if you can even get them to follow your commands at all. Once they are under attack they refuse to move quickly, usually the down fall of my squad. They get shot at then just lay down and i scream at them to get for cover and they will go, just reaaaaally slowly making there way there, standing up then laying down again. Its riddle with bugs. Please don't support bohemia, they dont even care to fix there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. They have been using the same engine for a decade, literally,   Even with a beast of a computer arma will not utilize i properly ending. Good luck getting on a servre cause they are way laggier then just single player.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMdzwanxnY   Just please, don't buy this game. Just don't.
553	1	a	Much better than the others  Feels like you are the soldier rather than just controlling some robot  Pros - Great gunplay - Awesome graphics - AI will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you up - PvP is a blast when it is only players and no AI  Cons - Bad singleplayer - No good PvP servers - Playing online will drop your frames (Horriable for PvE) - Some guns feel lacking  P.S There is a DayZ mod for this game called breaking point which is fun and has great optimization
63	0	a	It's fun but for the time it's been out it should be a lot less buggy than it is. I don't think the devs care about this game anymore. I'd recommend SQUAD instead of this anyday
555	1	a	A game that has so much variety and so much fun packed into it, if you like some medium/slow realistic firefights with vehicles and choppers flying around this is the game for you. make shure you have the pc that can handle it before you buy it, takes a pritty good cpu
557	1	a	Got out of my boat to do a sunken treasure in wasteland, flew 50 feet into the air and got hit by a jet.    10/10 would play again
559	1	a	I will destroy ISIS.
561	1	a	ArmA III... Another timeless source of entertainment from Bohemia Interactive. Although it improves upon its predecessor - ArmA II / Operation Arrowehad - in many ways, there is definately room for improvement. While the game is more intensive on your hardware, especially CPU and GPU, for obvious reasons, the game does appear to be lacking a bit of optimisation. Saying that, it's not bad at all, and is perfectly playable. Players on a lower end PC may experience serious lag issues when playing large missions, especially during multiplayer.  ArmA 3 is a tactical shooter. Call of Duty or Battlefield fanboys go home. It is one of the most authentic combat simulators available to the public. It is not perfect, however. For what ArmA 3 lacks in realism and authenticity, it makes up for with a better physics engine, improved bullet ballistics, better graphics, ragdoll physics and an even bigger map. ArmA 3, like most of its Bohemia Interactive siblings, and many other games on the market, is a dish best served multiplayer. It's a very squad-based, team-work orientated warfare experience. You CAN go lone wolf rambo; there is nothing stopping you. However, you should be prepared to die very quickly and you may negatively impact both you and your teammates with your actions. In multiplayer, make sure you have all sectors covered and that you've got your teammates backs. Every squadmember is a vital asset, and if you screw up your whole team will pay the price. It's not about the points, it's about the mission. You cease to be a player; from the moment you join a server your mentality should be that you are a cog in the war machine. Be the best you can be; weigh your options, play tactically and, if you're lucky, you might 'Survive', 'Adapt' and 'Win'.  The AI is somewhat disappointing, can be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes you can run right past them and they will not notice you. Other times, they will detect and headshot you from 500m away, first shot, in the middle of the night and fog all around. This seems to have improved since the Alpha release of the game, however. The AI is often fairly consistent in its behaviour. They are not to be treated as the weak AI you might storm through in other games. While they often are incapable of matching the abilities of a skillful player, the AI an often deadly foe. Respect the AI, and try to put yourself in their shoes. While you may cry 'bull****!' when an AI kills you, were you the AI shooting at the player that is yourself, I am sure it not seem so ridiculous and their shots so impossibly accurate anymore. Stick to cover, stay calm and don't do anything stupid. Use your teammates to help you (or try... public servers can get messy). If you want to enjoy ArmA 3 to the fullest, I would definately suggest seeking out and joining a 'Realism Unit'. Realism units are player groups which emulate the battlefields of today (and even some which are chronologically seperate from today). There, you will hopefully find organised, structured, tactical and authentic gameplay. If, like most people, that is what brought you to the ArmA series, a Realism Unit is where you belong.  One thing ArmA has always had is a vast modding community, and fans are constantly producing and releasing more content. A modification I am particularly looking forward to is the Advanced Combat Environment (more commonly known as ACE2, the sequal to ACE for the original ArmA: Armed Assault game) mod for ArmA 3. In ArmA 2, which utilised a more realistic feeling, simulator-ish, yet more restrictive engine, I had a lot of fun with ACE. It adds lots of functionality and added realism, and helps to expand the world of Arma. The 'Authentic Gameplay Modification' (AGM) and Comabt Space Enhancement (CSE) were two realism mods which expanded the gameplay significantly, which have since been discontinued. Their teams have merged, along with some of the developers from ACE2, to develop the recently announced ACE3. As of your reading this, ACE3 is probably already released and one of the most widely used mods in the ArmA III modding scene.  Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of the ArmA series, and one that gives it such longevity and popularity, would be the powerful mission editor tools. On the Steam Workshop, and several other online websites, you can find both Singleplayer and Multiplayer community-made missions with varying difficulties and talent. The ALiVE mod for ArmA 3 allows mission makers to easily build large-scale, dynamic, evolving missions utilising procedural generation, helping to flesh out the ArmA experience.  I am excited to see what ArmA IV will bring to the table, if Bohemia Interactive decide to create a fourth installment in the series. They probably will, and I do think the first thing they will need to work on if they want to have a snowball's chance in hell of selling an ArmA 4, would be the AI. It isn't bad, but it is far from good and needs some massive improvement.
563	1	a	Damn, if this is only the Alpha, what can we expect in the beta and the full game?!
565	1	a	*After two hours of benchmarking and testing my FPS i finally played it smoothly, so i decided to join a Co-op server.) :/ *I chose to be an auto-rifleman and grabbed an LMG, Big backpack and ammo, a few grenades too.* :D *I took a helicopter to a drop-point, to come under fire by the enemy!* :O *I quickly laid down and just began shooting, and after killing about two, i laughed evily over Direct Communications.* &gt;:3 *My friends died and i tried accessing their inventory, so i pressed G like in arma 2. I threw a grenade and died.* D: *I respawned and did the same mistake, just to get banned from the server.* :'c  10/10 would benchmark again.
567	1	a	I highly recommend getting this game, it has so much content and I have so far met so many friends by playing it! The Atlis Life game mode is my favorite and it takes you on a real life experience of surviving on an island with cops, rebels and civilians. You will have to do many things such as drug runs to get money, rob people, raid cities, etc. the new apex dlc just adds to how fun this game is, please get it to see if you like it and if not just return it :)
569	1	a	Great graphics, and great storyline. Only problem is that they need to add steam cloud, cause when I transferred this to my computer, all my hard work was gone. But other than that, amazing game.
571	1	a	Epic. comparing this to battlfield and cod is like comparing a private jet to ryanair to a bike
573	1	a	Amazing game with the possibility of making real life scenarios and improving milatary tactics. Love it 10/10 and i would recommend it to everyone who is intrested :)
575	1	a	Loveing it with 800+ hours on it mre content PLEASE
577	1	a	Buy it. Now. Join 11th AMB, install mods. Have infinite fun.
579	1	a	The BEST military game that i have ever played !!! The game even gets better when you join a milsim community, and add some moddâ€™s just to give you that bit more realism.
581	1	a	This game's review has had a long time coming from me honestly.  The single most played game within my Steam collection is undoubtly Arma 3. It is one of the few games I play that I continue to come back to over and over again.  I won't go into much of the stuff you can read about online through professional reviews; stuff like the mechanics, graphics, etc. What I will go over though is why exactly this game is a gym despite any short comings and why it has such a loyal community.  Arma is a game that scales with your imagination. While not necessarily easy, users can create whatever mod they want for this game. Just recently I saw a video for a T-Rex mod. T-Rex aside, many of the modders for this game take it upon themselve to implement items and equipment into the game that the developers could not (most likely for legal purposes/trademarks). Missions are made constantly so there is never a worry of running out of something to do in Arma 3.  With one of the largest maps, realistic ballistics, and a sometimes brutally hard AI, the game provides a sandbox for players to play whatever military simulation they could every desire. Games can be designed to have a small 4 man team infiltrating small enemy camps or they can be designed to have huge operations with several platoons, armored vehicles, and airsupport.  My only warning would be to take your time learning the game and the modding community. When I first purchased Arma 2, I didn't play it for a year after my initial play through because I didn't quite 'get' the game. My brother also was not a fan of Arma 3 at first. This is a game you need to Google and learn about. The rewards are definitely worth the time.
583	1	a	If Call of Duty is a Hollywood 'military porn' movie, and Battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects, Arma is the trip down to the local military base, spending time on the range and on the obstacle course, and learning the real deal from the real people. Its about as close as you can get without signing up.  Arma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity, set in a near-future ficticious scenario of 2035, wherein NATO is but a shadow of its former (aka: current-day) self, and a new enemy of Iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the Agean Sea, leading to a potential 'flashpoint' of a wider war between NATO-allied nations near the Medittereanean and the Iranian-led 'CSAT' forces, with Greek-based freedom fighters and the Greek army caught inbetween.  There is a large focus (stemming from 4 games prior, not including expansions) on realism, and not the Hollywood 'realism' that Call of Duty or Battlefield would throw at you. This game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics (range, ballistics drop, penetration, deflection, windage), proper modelling of the kilometers of distances you'll oftentimes have to travel, proper weapons, vehicles, and equipment modelling and mechanics, and proper tactics and strategy implementation.  How proper? Well the seminal game of the series, let alone this infantry simulator genre, was the penultimate 'Operation Flashpoint' of 2001 (now named Arma: Cold War Assault), which led to the development of the Virtual Battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world, alongside the next games in the series (with the new name), Armed Assault (or Arma).  Whilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note (and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since Arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game), the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature, allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds, oftentimes with a multiplayer bent, for the game. Many of these missions are in the Steam Workshop, a first for the series.  The multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straight-up 'hardcore' simulation fanatics, exercising proper military procedures, tactics, and actions, to GTA-like -Life servers, Wasteland (read: DayZ in Arma), and everything in between (Insurgency, and Domination/Invade&amp;Annex). In fact, many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all community-born, with the different communities that play Arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type, with many having a lot of bleed-over into each other, or being a singular experience on their own. One's multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you, and Arma's many communities are a notch above the expected grade, with all kinds from laid-back to straight-up, oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military. You wont feel alone if you look around, and the people you will find are of all kinds, many for the better.  This game is highly recommended to those who feel that Battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace, and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work, from close-quarters battle (CQB) in room clearing, to urban MOUT combat and open areas, to infantry - mechanized - armor - air interplay and supports.
585	1	a	In my opinion... This is an absolute great game, extremely fun to play. If your thinking about getting it, get it. I purchased this game during the Summer Sale &amp; do not regret it at all. Get this game, you'll love it. Woulda payed $60 for it, if I knew it was this much fun.
587	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Best simulation game I have played in a long time. So happy I found it!
589	1	a	Love it, woukd recommend anyday, so much possibility its unreal
591	1	a	Some Epic mods on this game. Breaking Point, Wasteland and King of The Hill being my favourites. Worth buying for any of those mods on thier own!
593	1	a	9.5/10
595	1	a	Overall, the game is pretty good. I myself can say that I am somewhat pleased with it, the Map is HUGE and very fun to explore it's just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles, maybe more planes and helicopter. They did mention they will be releasing new DLC for the game thank god I bought this when it was in Alpha. Otherwise I wouldn't be buying all that DLC. Bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general European public. :)
597	1	a	Must Play with a clan. Totally worth the money if played like that.
599	1	a	This game is a rly fun and who ever wants to buy it go for it
601	1	a	No point having a huge review, if you've not heard of ARMA by now then you're likely not the target audience.  If you have heard of it and you're on the fence - Get the game when it's cheap if you must, but you will not regret it if you take the time to learn the basics. Unlimited replayability, amazing potential. Typical lifespan for a game like this is 10yrs + (People still make mods for OFP) so you can easily get your moneys worth.  Enjoy!
603	1	a	Great game. Nothing beats this in the Military Simulator Genre.
605	1	a	Man, doe be like comin out of the trees and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and you be all like 'Oh mayne, who hims that? You that' and your team all like 'nah, it ain't me, but it do' and you like 'Yah, it do' and then you both shoot him and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, people droppin all around, man with helichopter come in all shootin missiles and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, blowing up children and you like 'Yah, but there is the cav' and everyone else dying, but you not. Nah, you not.  
607	1	a	AHHH, i love this game :)
609	1	a	Complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with.  - I didnâ€™t like it in the beginning I found it rigid and complex, mainly because I was comparing it to the other FPS games in the market  + Very good gameplay + Fancy graphics and physics are good + huge community contribution  - You will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning   I recommend it :)
611	1	a	If your computer can play it on at least normal settings with 30+ fps, must buy! 11/10.
67	0	a	REALISM? REALLY? (this review pertains to the campaign)  -Enemies you hit jump three feet in the air (pop! just to let you know you hit them) wtf?  -A running simulator often enough, but you are winded after running for 20-30 seconds. Really? Am I a soldier in this game or a lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥ gamer? Don't remind me I am the latter please. -An interface so clunky (and barely explained in the prologue) you will find yourself googling how tos again and again. You really will feel like a lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥ gamer who ended up in a military situation, well done.  -Gunfire sounds seem to come from the spot where the bullets landed, NOT where they were fired from.  -Passing enemy helicopters never seem to see you/call in a squad to engage you. -AI squadmates run off without you to engage the enemy despite having no ammo, while you are trying to loot bodies for anything useful. -AI squadmates often get tired if you haven't killed an enemy and grenade his â™¥â™¥â™¥ from quite a distance. Which is nice, but after it happens a few times you realize you aren't learning anything. -The impromptu basecamp in the campaign mentioned it had an armory. Nice! Except command for some reason placed the armory outside of camp, on a table, like some peddler, and not inside the base where such assets would be actually safe.   I guess that was my problem, I expected realism.   To boot, the game has been around since June 25, 2013, and yet the campaign they developed goes from boring to running simulator to incredibly difficult, and is over very quickly.   It stands to reason I suppose, since from release they game has felt more like a massive modding toolset than a game released for playing. At least the old operation flashpoint shooters (though buggy, largely unmoddable and hard as hell) had a semblance of a campaign, and the ability to issue orders to your squadmates. Here you are along for the ride, frustrating in most cases, laughable for the rest.
613	1	a	not bugged at all
615	1	a	Best game you can ever have!
617	1	a	The best mil simulation so far !
619	1	a	Nothing gets real but this.
621	1	a	I haven't played it that much but i think it's alright ;)
623	1	a	Best Military Simulation Game Ever!
625	1	a	Graphics 8.9/10 Pretty game  Gameplay 4/10 too many bugs it feels very unstable at stages  Singleplayer 4/10 HARD But fun at stages  Multiplayer 8/10 Only Lives Up To ItÂ´s Potential With Friends  Controls 5/10 You use many of you buttons and many in the wrong place  Great Multiplayer With Friends But A Bit Too Many Bugs
70	0	a	WOLD BE GOOD IF I COLD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PLAY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME!
627	1	a	really good, really engaing game. nothing more exciting then hiking
629	1	a	I've had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with it.,..until I found Altis Life! WOW! It's so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on Altis Island. If you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you, then this is definitely the game for you! Top Drawer!!
631	1	a	One of the best FPS/TPS games i've ever played. If u like tactics, simulation and hardcore - try ArmA III
633	1	a	10/10 like Skyrim with guns  Also I can't see â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
635	1	a	They Spelt Army wrong. Thats ok though.
637	1	a	Easily my favourite game right now. While there is less content than ARMA 2 right now, BIS is continually adding more. This game is definitely not for your typical CoD kiddy as it takes patience and strategy which all adds into the experience.   The biggest thing for me is that this is a community game. BIS has simply provided a platform where the community makes limitless mods and missions for the user to enjoy. Speaking of mods, THEY ARE AWESOME! Anything from radio mods, to sound mods, to vehicle and weapon additions, and even entire new maps and game mods (there's even a mech warrior mod).  The immersion in this game is great and I would highly reccomend taking the time to join a community. Doing this, you'll gain access to the real ARMA experience and not Atlis Life/Wastelands. Community events are great and there's basically one out there that would suit any player.  Lastly, this game supports multiple control inputs which is a HUGE plus for me. For example I have essentially 5 control inputs: keyboard, mouse, Track IR, joystick/hotas, and steering wheel/pedals. They all work seemlessly together and allow for some really awesome configurations. For example, the pedals are tri-purpose. I use them for the obvious brake and gas while driving but I additionally use them for analogue leaning as infantry and rudder pedals while flying.
639	1	a	Arma 3 is one of the most versatile mil-sim games out there. The support from the developers alone puts this game at the top of any mil-sim list. The vanilla AI are pretty over-powered for what they do. They can get non-stop headshots from 600m away. But a couple AI mods and they react much more realistically. Coming from Arma2, this is game a huge improvement. The addition of PhysX adds a lot to gameplay. Overall, I'm very impressed with the game. Add the developer modding support, and this game is the top of my list.
641	1	a	This game is so much fun. Dont buy if you have below a dual core though, you wont be able to run it well at all. I have a dual core and play it fine though, no lag or anything. This game is as close as it gets to real life and actually required skill, planning, and patience unlike any other FPS on the market. If you are looking for the best FPS/military simulator look no further. You've found it. Its Arma 3. 11/10 great game
643	1	a	best military simulator ever
645	1	a	Been playing since the beginning of the Alpha, and this game has stayed so unique. This game is a genre on it's own, nothing else out there like it. The community surrounding this game makes it all that much better, and the modding community is so big. This game is heavily moddable, which gives the community the tools they need to create anything, there is no limits. This is also one of the more hardcore FPS games out there, it's easy to get used to, but hard to get good at, and you can't do anything without a good team. All this game requires is patience, and the ability to work with other people. In order for me to fully explain how awesome this game is, I'd be sitting here all day typing this review out.   10/10, will never quit playing.  
647	1	a	Ive had this game sitting in my library forever, i tired playing the campaign awhile back and just couldnt get into it. Well today i tried out a co op server. About 8 hours later i realized I was extremely hungry and it was nearly 3 in the morning. After 1 session of playing i had plenty of super fun moments from my very first mission where our helicopter got shot down almost instantly upon entering the AO leaving me as the lone survivor all the way up to my last mission where we had an insane firefight with overwhleming odds. What really wraps the game together though is the sound...One second you're moving towards an objective and suddenly bullets cracking overhead becomes the only thing you hear. What makes this even more tense is you might not know where you're being shot from and even once you do find the bad guys, you have to fight through the recoil of your weapon and your fatigue in hopes you can land a nice shot on them. You are not Superman in this game, you can't mow down bad guys like Call of Duty and youcan die faster than you can blink if you're not careful. Really fun game if you want to get as close to combat as you can without actually being there.
649	1	a	The best slide show that I have ever played.
651	1	a	There are no real words, its just great a proper simulation of ground warfare. Been a player since the first Operation Flashpoint and loved its mission editor and the ability to mod and end up with all manner of scenerios and missions from the campaign that comes to the game to entire vietnam mods for the old ARMA, to playing UN peacekeer to being a civilian just trying to survive.  So much great stuff, its not a run and gun like COD its an open sandbox so crack open that creativity and have as much fun making as you can playing.
653	1	a	Now that it is out of Alpha, it had been a very pleasant experience for me. 9/10
71	0	a	Glitchy. Its been out for a long time and I finally got it but I'm not into it at all. Love flying helicopters but maybe 20 minutes or so in, the flight stick is suddenly unrecognized and I have to restart. Its infuriating. Added to a whole other mess of glitches and lackluster multiplayer (for me anyway) and frustrating single player. I'll rate it a meh. I'll be hated for it, but that's okay.
655	1	a	I have played it a while and to now i think it's a good game. It was funny in the beggining with Altis life, and now to A3L. To rate it i would give it a 8/10. ps. dont compare this with gta 5 at all. Good stuff: - Nice guns - Good graphics - Good sniping experience - Good planes - Military Tactics - Tactical Movement  Down Sides: - Can be laggy for a bad computer - 3rd Person can be abused and it's annoying - Stairs kill you - Glitching into objects and then explode :P - Bushes is filled with spike strips and explosives  Other than that its not more down sides about it. If you are thinking about buying it its a good buy.
657	1	a	Spend 3 days hiding in a bush, get shot by someone you can't see.  10/10
659	1	a	This is sandox taken to a new scale. This is the tropical beach that makes other would be 'sandbox' games seem like a pile of dirt in a schoolyard.
661	1	a	10/10 - Insane, real life survival  I'm not good at this game, but I really love it. It's as close to real survival as you can get. Multiplayer will get the heart pumping. It's a dog eat dog kinda place though. Other players will murder you, steal from you, tie you up and call you names. Be ready to get betrayed. BRING YOUR OWN FRIENDS!   So many mods and online servers. There is something for everyone in this game. As a bonus the Single player is really fun too!  This game is truely worth the price. $50-60. Buy it.     Accidently Reviewed
663	1	a	Best Game Series I have ever played (along with Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven).   Features:     Good-looking graphics.    Good AI, especially then they operate in squads.    Amazing editor and modding community, so you can literally do anything you want.    Atmospheric sound effects.    Simulation of everything, from realistic day/night cycle, to ballistics.    Immersion. Srsly, It's like you are there.    Great multiplayer, which has lots of game modes for your taste.    Zeus, so you can create and change missions on the fly for other players. You are literally God for others. Take that, Peter Molyneux!    Memorable experiences, You'll want to share with friends.    More stuff I forgot to mension.   Great game! C: 
73	0	a	nah, I'm not buying the DLC to get in some vehicle when I paid full price for this game.
665	1	a	...a wonderful game, to loose yourself in it for hours. It has a kinda big learning curve, but its acctually worth going threw it.  I enjoy myself in the Multiplayer a lot and love the challange of battleing other gamers while doing Missions. Addons such as the TFR, JSRS or the Nato-Speznas weapons make it to a real nice Warfare simulation. It requires a good CPU and GPU, but all in all its a nice game to play and i am happy i purchased it ;)
667	1	a	i hate cops â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the police. they always giving me tickets and take my weed before i can sell it. damn role play is so annoying cant a man sell his weed in peace.
74	0	a	Despite many warnings from the community, bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine, again. Thus resulting in 90 FPS in single player, down to 10 - 15 in multiplayer, servers can't even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server, resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game. Instead of fixing the AI, glitches and trying to optimize the game, bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above. What's that? You want single player? Oh well you'll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those SP episodes, why yes they are free, as they should be, as you have just paid for a $60 dollar alpha.  Oh and the only thing people play in this 'realistic army sim' is a god damn RPG average civi game type where you role play YOUR ACTUAL BORING LIFE.
75	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t on so many levels. 1. The AI hasnt improved since Operation Flashpoint In 2001 (Still a Better Game than this) 2. You are berated with pop up ads on your screen which dont go away untill you buy the overpriced DLC that they advertise. 3. Your vehicles stop working when you do so much as tap a rock with one. 4. Most servers are cancer that will kick you for doing anything against their unlisted and crappy listed ones. (Ala DarkRP) 5. Overpriced DLC (Seriously? $15 for 3 Helicopters?) 6. Too much focus on graphics and other gimmicks  Never buying another Arma game until Bohemia gets their **** together. Go buy the much cheaper and much better Operation Flashpoint Instead.
76	0	a	Dissapointing. The game feels like it's still in Beta stage.
77	0	a	Inferior in every way to ARMA 2: Combined Ops.  -Insanely Overpriced DLC -20 years, still no AI or Netcode improvement? -Absolutetly Tiny collection of vehicles and weapons compared to the last game -Altis and Stratis don't have the atmosphere of Chernaurus -Game essentially bullies you into buying DLC  +Animations are much smoother +Firefights do feel more alive  I can't, in good faith, recommend this game over Arma 2:CO, especially that the servers have migrated to steam. What my main gripe is the DLC - $15 for 7 guns? Another $15 for 2 helicopters? $35 for an Island that is very similiar to already community made maps? Not worth near as much as they are charging.   Also, the community is probably the most toxic I've seen - and I've played 300 hours of Rust.  EDIT: There is also a catastrophically game-breaking bug that forces the FPS down to 5, and makes everything go lowpoly and low res. To top it off, it always seems to happen in the most critical of moments.
669	1	a	Simply put, no other game compares to Arma 3. The best combat simulator on the market, nothing comes close to delivering what Arma does. TL;DR PROS/CONS at the bottom!  Literally, no other game is as much of a sandbox as Arma 3. With oodles of content already baked into the game, there's thousands of hours literally to explore just of the vanilla content! Then, pile on the massive and hugely supportive mod community.. And you have the recipe for a game that keeps on giving.   Once you find an appropriate multiplayer circle that suits you and you feel at home, and are experiencing content YOU want to see in your gaming experience, you will get lost in the hours spent. The community of Arma is one of the most diverse and enduring in all of gaming, and is a special spot in PC gaming as a whole.   There's loads of singleplayer content in there too, the campaign is fully voice acted and is a great showcase of what the engine can do.  All the awesome to be spoken of, it does have it's few shortcomings, like most titles. The first one would be the tremendous real world PC requirements, yes you will need a higher end machine to have a truly enjoyable time in this title, to get any decent FPS. This game is a CPU hog, expect your CPU to turn into your room heater during long sessions. It is prone to many very annoying (and sometimes gamebreaking) bugs, that will break your experience if you let it get to you. Finding your community niche can be hard if you don't know what to search for.  All the cons being said though... They all have ways you can get around them as a personal player.   The problems relating to your computer, have an intel i5 or equivelent and a 2GB GPU, and you're in a pretty good start zone for getting acceptable FPS for an okay experience.  Think exponentially for a better experience in the CPU, Arma 3 MAY benefit from more VRAM in the future, but for now is limited to 2GB VRAM, hard-coded into the engine. The game is still 32-bit, so does not use more then 3GB of RAM anywho, though faster RAM will always result in better load times.  As for the bugs and glitches you (can) encounter with this game... Very rarely does it crash, only under the most intense conditions should you ever see this come close to happening, the worst case scenario I have personally experienced was just extremely poor FPS under insane conditions, that equated to my game essentially locking up. But... That's not really the issues you'll be concerned about. There are several nuances to several systems within the game that like to just bug. The network is very easy to desync, and this causes all kinds of zany bugs. As an experienced player, I learn to troubleshoot these issues quickly as a part of the experience, and to be sure to always laugh at it. Remember, it's a game. Again, these issues are not specifically game breaking, but can be experience breaking.  I really do love this game. I look forward to the DirectX12 update coming with the new Tanoa terrain map. Hopefully we get a smoother ride with DirectX12, but for now this is an endearing experience if you are willing to engage yourself as a player. The gaming experiences you have in this sandbox are unrivaled, no other gaming experience will compare. If you have a love for true gaming, this game belongs in your library in my opinion. This is Game Of The Century for me, despite it's shortcomings, the experience is unlike any other.   TL;DR PROS/CONS LIST: Basically.. It's like a girlfriend. You're going to love it, you're going to hate it at times, but you know there's a reason you put up with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t... Because there's nothing else like it that compares.  PROS: -Amazing endless sandbox experience that is customizable to your liking. -Beautiful graphics and entertaining physics really brings together an immersive experience. -Best combat simulator on the market hands down, experience unlike any other. -Endearing and loving community really makes the game feel complete.  CONS: -Experience breaking and sometimes game breaking bugs can be annoying if you don't know how to deal with it. -Requires a higher end PC to run acceptably, I really can't reccomend this game for low end PC users. -Sometimes some of the community can be little nutsacks.
671	1	a	DON'T BUY IT THROUGH STEAM! FOR TODAY EVERY ARMA GAME IS FOR 21 BUCKS   https://store.bistudio.com/products/arma15-bundle 
78	0	a	It's ARMA with a facelift. Honestly, I wish there was more to the game. I know it's alpha and more will be added -- but it's the stuff I've already seen which are bothersome. Physics engine still totally broken, still using that god-awful proprietary SQF scripting language which makes me want to kill myself (I know there's supposed to be some Java integration in the future, but that's not exactly a step up, and it most likely won't replace the SQF but will rather become an addition to it). There is some really cool stuff though. The helicopters are really fun to operate and you have a ton of (new) stances you can use to your advantage to find a sweet spot while taking fire. It's worth buying for the price for sure, but I'm a little sad they haven't improved the core more, nor does it look like they will in the beta or final release.
673	1	a	Hmm... I don't know , I think I need a few more hours to make a better review
79	0	a	Great game if you intend to play it with friends online. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor if you're planning on playing it singleplayer. If you are I'd wait until they fix all the bugs (especially the AI). The AI in this game is the worst I've ever seen. In anything. Just a couple of minutes ago an AI soldier in my squad ran out 1 meter in front of me while I was still shooting (I'd been lying in the grass fiering at the same location for a good while) and was cut down by my bullets. Mission failed. And that was the third or fourth time that happened. And the opposing AI is not better. It's as if the developers realized their AI sucked so they just gave it wallhack and aim bot. Literally. You can be in a forest somewhere, covered by rocks and bushed, fiering at an enemy 100 meters away. The second you shoot, all his friends will immediatly turn and start shooting at you, most likely hitting you straight in the face in their 3rd or 4th shot. Not running for cover or even going prone, just standing like a poor imitation of schwartzenegger and shooting from the hip. That is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t AI if I ever saw one.  EDIT: Yeah, don't play it multiplayer either.. Glitches where you get stuck in doors, your character just rise up from prone at the worst possible occations and when you get shot through walls because your feet or backpack was no-clipping through it so they could see you through the other side. And this happens all the time. Such an awesome game in theory. Such increadibly terrible execution.
80	0	a	Could be awesome, but the Devs lack the ability to polish the game to a enjoyable state.  We hosted some Coop Events but the AI even with Zeus support is too horrible. Buggy and after a while ingame they dont react to orders, even custom scripts cant fix it. They move like complete Morons, and once u figured out that they stop firing at a certain distance and just look at u, they become target pratice at best.  Wouldnt bother me if PvP works. Deathmatch modes without Mods do, the Rest starts lagging horribly after u go above 40 players(i5-4690k). Pepole warp around, cant enter vehicles unless they reconnect, random disconnects. Gunplay is awful, in cbq u both die due to the bad netcode.  Animations are from the 2000s, when u hit someone they start waving their weapon around , close to statics ur Soldier randomly goes from prone to standing up. Everything is clunky and unfinished, giving u an uneasy feel while playing.  The Scripting Wiki is outdated and some Commands dont work as described, or only sometimes, changing weather and stuff just stops working until u restart the server.  Waste of Money and Time.
675	1	a	This game is brilliant, as all the other reviews will most-likely say too.  It's very simular to Arma 2 of course but with even more added features, improved UI's and stunning graphics. The campaign is a little tricky but that's part of the fun and the online multiplayer is extremely enjoyable. It kind of reminded me of Battlefield mixed with Planetside? - Either way, some of the most enjoyable PC gaming can easily be had playing this work-of-art game!   Anything bad to say? No. Although many have most-likely listed a full article on all the flaws and glitches. Honestly, I didn't notice anything bad whilst playing neither will you unless you're a straight-out critic.
677	1	a	Incredible and immersive experience for fans of proper war games. The attention to detail is outstanding, the weapons, player gear and vehicles are completely authentic, right down to the tiniest details. The audio is amazing, the sound of bullets peppering your surroundings while you're in the fetal position praying that your cover is sufficient, explosions that sound as badass as they look, the sound of your weaponary, it's all done amazingly well. The gameplay forces you to play more or less how you would in a real life situation, using military tactics and teamwork to advance your position, you'll get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' used as a mop if you're thinking about getting those 'sick kill streaks' you get in those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ console shooters. On a technological scale, Arma 3 is by far the most advanced and impressive game I've ever played, nothing comes remotely close. Right now, the game has optimization issues although they seem to be ironing that out, you'll need a powerful rig to experience this game in all it's glory.
81	0	a	Full of bugs paid $80 for game then they bring out DLC's!! The dog's want me to buy plus if you don't have said DLC's you get spamed constantly If i ever meet the Devs i will kickem right in the nuts
82	0	a	I really hate to say this, but you should wait to get this game until BIS gets it finished, assuming that happens. The reader should realize that I have almost 2000hrs in ArmA2. The 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to Steam and doesn't count the time pre-Steam.  So, as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers, not on big public servers. As someone who plays mostly CTI maps (remember those BIS?), and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying CAS in a jet (remember those BIS?), .......I can honestly say that I'm rather let down by ArmA 3 and it makes me very sad.  The interface has always been clunky from way back in OFP and before. The new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing. It does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff (novel!!), and while I appreciate the work here.....I'd rather have seen the time spent on other things.  To be fair, two of the devs DID spend time locked up in Greece for a stupid reason. I think it was 11 months? This is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason. But, I understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two LEAD devs as I understand it. I get the feeling that they got back, and shoved development through in order to compete with the (then) new BF and CoD releases. I personally feel this was a huge, quivering pile of mistake. Because......they aren't really in competition with those games!!! It'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly. All board games sure but vastly different. Same here! ArmA II was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator. Though I think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers. ArmA III seems to go away from this and I think it's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways.....maybe I'm wrong? It just doesn't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer.  For me, the fact that it's set in 2035 is a HHHHUUUUUUUGE turn-off and almost a game breaker right there. That, and there's ONE jet in the game thus far.....one AND it's some old trainer POS to boot.....nice.....well guess this confirms my hunch I've had for a while now. BIS seems to hate fixed wing like Blizzard hates melee! It's all about rotary wing! Which is fine and dandy unless you need an A10 or a Spooky. By 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out, so where are their replacements? Hell, at this point I'd be happy with an F15 that I can just fly and do stand-off attacks with from miles away.....oh right that's what the choppers are for!  Am I ranting a bit there? Um, yes sorry, but I was just looking SO foward to this game!!! Heck I even did the pre-order on the delux version!! NOW? Ya I'm kinda not happy about that.  I fire the game up now and then after I see an update downloading. Just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a .45-110 every shot......it's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody's there.  So, I'd say to wait on this game. I'm still playing ArmAII where I can fly fixed wings even in the base game. Oh yes I know...mods mods mods....ya *hangs head*
83	0	a	So I played this game when it was free for 3 days and I only played it for a little while. First of all the game was not very well optimized and I found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. I thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. I would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (Recommend an $1000 PC Minimum) But if you play free games like me and don't have an extreme PC build I don't really recommend the game that much.
84	0	a	Got the game recently (having never played an Arma game) and although i had heard that the controls were difficult i was willing to spend the time learning them, what got me is that as soon as you enter the multiplayer, you hit walls upon walls of text that the game doesn't tell you anything about.I understand most of it is user-created content but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly confusing joining a server and being told little to nothing about what is going on, you just know its either 'Altis Life' or 'King Of The Hill' etc. It kinda makes you think they could've done with a few tutorial servers with different game modes so new players aren't extremely confused from the off.  Well the first time i went in to a multiplayer game (in a server about 2/3rds full) the chat channels were completely dead, all i heard was what presumably was a fellow noob constantly saying 'Hello' (There was someone else talking occasionally but the sound quality was so grainy i couldnt make out anything he was saying) . I figure everyone is on the teamspeak server as from what I'd heard 'everyone uses ts on Arma' but nowhere in game did it say where the name/address of the ts server and when i asked in the sidechat the other lobby members told me to stop using sidechat. Similar experiences occurred on the few other servers i tried going on as well. The game shows a complete lack of effort to help anyone who has never played an ARMA game before, how to play the online, and the people playing it seem antisocial and uninterested in helping either.  Judging from some of the reviews. the campaign isn't very good either but at least its playable, I'll probably end up on that for a bit in the hope that one day, if i ever manage to get my head around the multiplayer, i won't get constantly mowed down and showed up for the complete noob i am at this game! Overall probably a good game for those new to the Arma series if you have a spare 20 odd hours you are willing to put in to figure out the what is going on in the online game modes, what addons and mods you will need for the game, what ts servers you need to be in, what the controls are, then you will probably reach a stage where you can enjoy the game. But if you don't have that amount of spare time to search the internet for help guides, tutorials, and server info, then you will probably find the game very frustrating. Not at all noob friendly.
85	0	a	To be on point: Before purchasing Arma 3 I read about it on forums and on Steam reviews. Indeed, many said that at the moment Arma 3 is just not finished and it is not worth buying and playing as it is. I really liked the game idea and thought that it can't be that bad, so I purchased it. Boy I was in for a big surprise. And I am not talking only about the poor optimization of the game. The whole game feels weird, laggy and just plain wrong. The controls are a mess. For example, to fly with a joystick you have to set all the actions manually. At least in my case. Graphics wise, I might get older but the whole image seems to be blurry and out of sync. Maybe the biggest grief is with super human AI enemies. Somehow they can see you even in the darkest and deepest forest, while there is NO way you can see them, yet alone shoot them. I am sory to say, I regret the purchase and would not advise anyone to try the game in the current state. I would say in a year or so maybe, but not now. In case you want to help out the developer and support the game, by all means, purchase the game now. Play it later :) Do not get me wrong, the idea is super, the complexity is there, visual apeal is there, but it needs a lot of polish to be playable. I would like to state, for the record, that I couldn't get myself to play it for more than one hour. Maybe if I would have spent more time (I guess a lot more) in the game, I would have liked it more.  Just for reference: I7 2600k @ 4.4 ghz nVidia GTX 580 1.5 GB RAM 16 GB RAM @ 1600 Mhz CAS 8 Samsung Evo SSD = 40-50 FPS in SP  This is just my personal opinion and experience of the game. Take it with a grain of salt.  Over and out.
86	0	a	Oh ArmA. ArmA, ArmA, ArmA. The abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive, and less fun, and all it took was one title. One title full of empty promises, and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for DayZ 2. Let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series, and the company that I used to respect above every other.  The quick and dirty, would I recommend ArmA 3? Not by a mile. Sub-30 price tag, sure, you'll get your monies worth. But even for all the modders trying to save it, this is not a complete game. You should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of COMMUNITY created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product. If some of that money went to those modders, then I'd say support THEM, not BI. But it doesn't. Imagine buying a car, but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately. Sure the car runs, but just how useable is it?  A quick glance at my steam page would reveal that I highly praised BI's adventurous approach to ArmA 2, and OA. I loved ArmA with a blazing passion, even though it's considered the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of the series. OFP shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite mil-sims. Sure, since OFP, the series has had its caveats and nuances, but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided. So where did ArmA 3 go wrong? What could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games (+ 2 Expansions &amp; DLC)? Well, lets start with the company and work our way up. You see, riding on the heels of the massive success that DayZ was thanks to word of mouth and LPs, BI somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most AAA companies do (Incomplete Games for Full Price, DLC strategies), could be done to their small communities. And you know what? They were right. We all bought into it. BI slowly came to realize that they could do less work, and still make more money, because their communities could turn nowhere else. What amazes me most about DayZ, besides the fact that it is still in Alpha after almost 2 years, and that it's lead creator left, is that all it really did was show what ArmA 2 was already capable of. Massive, persistent worlds with Mil-Sim themes. Just, with zombies.  But, this is not a review of DayZ, this a review of ArmA 3. Any ArmA community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at ArmA 3's feet. Disguising as the enemy? Gone. The Railgun tank, one of the coolest features at E3, and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about? Poof. All the underwater showcases, hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay? Nope. Planes? We got 3. Funny thing is, all you Deluxe Edition owners should open up that Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures manual it comes with sometime, and view all the planes we should have had. The reskinned C-130 and F-35? Fugetta about it. That's right, we couldn't even get recycled content.  Now, let me be fair, ArmA 3's engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries. And OFP/ArmA has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content. But Vanilla, the games were usually very playable, and very enjoyable. This is where ArmA 3 comes up the shortest. While the engine is great, and getting better with each patch, not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content, but the underlying issues since OFP are still there. 2013/2014, we still have an action menu. BI, please. Not to mention that AI has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements, rather than better.  You know, some people actually say ArmA 2 people were spoiled because we had OFP and ArmA 1's content all rolled into one. I find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games. Who get paid for it. In closing I will say this. ArmA 3, as a game, is complete and total BS. ArmA 3, as a platform, for people to show their skills in modeling, texturing, and coding, fantastic. If you want ArmA 3, do it to support people who make great content. Just don't expect a full fledged game, for the full fledged price.
679	1	a	Its ok i guess
87	0	a	If you like games with crappy controls, bad gameplay, and no incentive to do anything then this is the game for you. I played for a few hours and 50% of my time was spent walking around the woods getting blown up by random mines that I could not find or avoid. It seemed like any direction I walked in I would just explode. And when i managed to get past that AI that were out of my guns range just took potshots at me till i died. And to top it all off the game mechanics are only briefly explained, and not very well.  I will never play this game again. I play games to relax and have fun, not to die 50 times just to walk to an objective. Bottom line is if you want to play a fun entertaining game this is not for you, but if your really into playing for 5 hours to just to walk to meet up with people by all means this game will be in your top 10.
88	0	a	DO NOT BUY IT! the CPU and GPU issues are so bad you will get 17fps slideshow in multiplayer on LOW/MED/NORM/HIGH/VHIGH/ULTRA settings, It's a shame this game had a lot of potential, singleplayer is great but don'r expect anything more then that. It will never be optimized for high end gaming rigs. Bohemia are uselss and don't even care about the issues!
89	0	a	The dissapointment is strong with this one... The game has some 'cool' features but is more frustrating than having explosive â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥how at your dates broken toilet. You get to use then new stances with ONLY the basics guns. Trying to do a half-kneel with an RPG or binocular to minimize detection, forget about it. Great uniforms (like in ARMA 2), combat gear (not much to choose between), and guns (worst sounds of the year award goes to...) The sight are also great, i especially love the extremely dirty reddots, that makes it seem like this 'soldier' has never heard of cleaning his bloody equipment. Trying to be sneaky? FORGET IT! EVERY footstep sound like a rhino trying to dance, he SMASHES his heels in the ground every damn time.  The engine and pshysics in this game are TERRIBLE! Basically, they took features we loved about ARMA 2, and replaced it with some very buggy, unrealistic, not working, pieces of of bad jokes!  Their marketing campaing is ALOT like EA! You have to buy things that is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing crucial for the gameplay - that cost ALOT of money, and still does not make the game work either!   Having the courage to admit that your game is SO unfinished that EA would not even realease it, and releasing the final things neede for it to be an actual 'Military realism shooter' for free, could make up for the buggy game. But instead you crave money for everything, even though the game is pretty expensive to start off with.  ARMA 2 -&gt; great game, but with awful pshysics and engine. ARMA 3 -&gt; Like a car without wheels and windshield. PLUS you are still stuck with the awful physics and engine!   So, if you end up buying this game you will end up needing to buy ALL the DLC's! Because they wil CONSTANTLY remind you that you '... ARE MISSING THE FOLLOWING DLCS'  
90	0	a	nice game, nice graphics ....acceptable gameplay with ai, good gameplay in pvp, could be lots of fun but there is only one reason i cannot recommend this game to someone ...if it happens you to be banned from BattlEye, you will get 0 (zero) support plus you will be banned from all games that uses BattlEye; Arma2, Day-Z etc ...i bought the game in the first day it came out, supporter editon 70euros ...just that i did not find the same support i was hopping to get if i have a problem ...i still love the game but no, no one has ever replied to me a damn thing to all my mails sent appart from the automated one ...so NO ...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! at least till BattlEye goes out of the picture ...Good Luck!
681	1	a	This game is amazing. Not only can you get just about any mod you want for it- you can get Breaking Point- DayZ in Arma. You can play Altis Life- make money and act a civilian or go do illegal things. You can play King Of The Hill- Get some PVP in. This is the best Multiplayer simulator and is definitely an amazing purchase that I've made and I'll never regret.
683	1	a	The sandals are fabulous!
685	1	a	As you can see from this review, I have almost 500 hours in the game, so if you're looking for someone who knows it, trust me. Arma 3 is a Military Simulator, which means that you aren't getting the constant grinding, free-for-all match ups you find in FPS games like Call of Duty or Battlefield. It also doesn't get much more realistic than this.   But in terms of the actual game, there are a plethora of things to do. There are Altis Life RPG servers, which allow you to play the way you want, within certain constraints of course. There are wasteland servers as well, which is essentially a giant battlefield for you to play in. Also, if you get a group of people, you can run some pretty awesome missions, not to mention have a blast with the Zeus mode, which allows a player to become a game master and run a mission dynamically.  Yes, there are bugs. Driving full force with a truck into a tank probably wouldn't cause it to blow up, for example. Rocks, walls, and even chicken-wire fences can disable plenty of vehicles, and sometimes the actual mechanics are pretty slow. But the major bugs that you find are usually because of some faulty coding in a server you play on, such as dropping a truck from a helicopter, only to have it disappear the next instant, or fling back up and blow you out of the sky.   Regardless of these, the actual content of Arma 3 is massive, and the situations you can create get to be incredibly intense. The $59.99 price tag on this game shouldn't stop you from buying it, because it is worth every penny. If you want to find some examples of people who play this game and have a great time, you can find a ton of videos on YouTube that may help you in your decision to buy it. Lastly, I mentioned before that this is not a Call of Duty or Battlefield game. They are all there own, and you may think that this game is too slow-paced if you are looking for that run-and-gun format of a game. But whileplaying this game, you find yourself in many different situations. Whether it be sneaking up to a compound while trying to avoid any contact, laser-designating a target for air-support to pulverize, or peaking around and pieing corners in a CQB scenario, you will find thousands of these unique situations, which make this game worthwhile to nearly every fan of FPS's and MILSIM's alike.
687	1	a	A-Must-Have-Game!
689	1	a	This game is fun to play any time, army simulator not just a fps but more
691	1	a	Lots of guns, lots of explosions.  Much worth money.
693	1	a	I went into battle wearing underwear and wielding nothing but a pistol with 200 rounds of ammo and 9 explosive charges 10/10
695	1	a	One Word for this Game:G-R-E-A-T  How many hours does a normal EA title entertain you for like 60-70 Bucks? 5-8 hours, maybe 10-12 hours?  ArmA3 is easily crushing those titles because of re-playability, nearly endless options of customization, building your own szenarios, scripts, addons, islands.   You can even find gametypes and mods, that change the way to play ArmA3. They modify it to be played apart from the original way to play it. (Those mods and missions are Boiling Point, Wasteland, Altis Life RPG)  Some might hit their heads now to a table, as this isnÂ´t the way ArmA is meant to be played. But it shows whats possible with the game and the engine at all =).   This is, what gamers want. A long term motivation (Look at my game hours :D) and a huge sandbox to be entertained for years.  (Sure there are bugs and features, the communitiy is mostly right to complain about) But the steps BIS did to fulfill the wishes of the community, involved changing parts of the team also. Since like 6-7 month the developing and bugfixing gets faster.  ArmA 3 in a nutshell: -A tactic Shooter with simulation elements. -You have to actually think before making a move. -You can have great battles, both coop and team-vs-team. -The Mod support for this game is really great. As above: User created content like islands, content addons, mods, missions, campaigns, replacements. -Even a normal battle between a fireteam gets you harder than it would on every other game here around.   If you search for a game where you are entertained for years, a semi-realistic warfare, combined arms gameplay, an open world sandbox game? Then look no further. Trash the other games and get in soldier!
697	1	a	The most amazing military simulator game out there! Also a great game un-modded as well as modded. This game has brought many players together through communities and clans! 10/10 No Doubt. Well done Bohemia!
699	1	a	Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.  Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.  To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.  This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.

701	1	a	After 1100 hours I think I can finally write a review on this game. Don't expect 60fps. Pros Best vanilla ballistics for a shooter Best modding community I've ever seen 12 different stances, useful for firing while in cover Supports TrackIR Variety of game modes 10,000x better community than CSGO, battlefield, or COD Bullets hurt Helicopters can still fly despite severe damage, autorotations often required  Cons Even a supercomputer wouldn't get more than 55 FPS Overly sensitive admins on some servers Need quality headset 6 of your steam friends will want this game Adding some mods may prove a challenge
703	1	a	Any other fps game is just for kids! This is the big deal, it's so realistic that when you shoot or land a helicopter you have to check the wind or you will miss.
705	1	a	It began far away, on the battlefields of Kavala. 5 Rebal Soilders went to harness expensive and pure gold hidden for centuries. They believe their heist will ensure the crews ultimate victory, but they could of never of imagined the amount of 5 year old cops that their heist would alarm.
707	1	a	Died because of bots spamming with grenade launchers. 11 AI \ 10
709	1	a	its okay i guess.            this game is life
711	1	a	You get some freindly people on this unlike Arma 2 never the less brill game!!
713	1	a	Great game. Love Battle Royale and King of th Hill...Recomend Hostile takeover servers for king of the hill.
715	1	a	Too much running.  10/10 would run again
717	1	a	went outside and immediately started scanning the bushes for snipers
719	1	a	ArmA 3 is the best war simulation game you can get today. The different multiplayer gamemodes you can play and all the mods thats in this game is insane, especially the RP communities that starting to become a massive thing in the gaming industry.   Even though ArmA 3 is the most realistic and full of gaming potential, it can be quite hard to find a community that you click with, typically you need to find some friends from outside and get them into this too, Then theres the time consume-  which basicly means, if you got a girlfriend that you have to spent time with, you either have to play ArmA 3 together or drop either ArmA or the GF(This is the best choice aha), then theres also the hardware issues. When I started playing ArmA 3 my Geforce Experience program automatically chose Ultra for all the settings, which my PC didn't really enjoy, so I crashed and lagged a lot, so I chose to look into the configs, and saw that it all was on Ultra, so I turned it to medium.(This was with a single GTX-660TI GPU), and now later I have bought 2(SLI) 970. So what have we learned yet?  Bad things 1st. Community play(Singleplayer is boring and etc.) 2nd. Time consuming. 3rd. Hardware issues.  Good things 1st. Awesome experiences with both RP and other kind of gamemodes. 2nd. Meeting people from all over the world, and forming an virtual community. 3rd. A really good solution if you want some competitive realistic war scenarios. 4th. A lot of online users, so you shouldn't worry about not finding a server for your favourite gamemode.  All in all, I find ArmA 3 one of my favourite games, which is why I have chosen to say that I think you should buy this game if you want something realistic and 'fun' but really time consuming.
721	1	a	  Review: Arma 3
723	1	a	This game will make you love it. Then it will kick you in the nuts and you will hate it. Then you will love it again
725	1	a	Do you like running 5 km's only to be killed by some kid with a rocket launcher? I would suggest the game mode 'Wasteland.   Do you like being killed by your own team-mates decision to land in a open field? If so than go play ''king of the hill''.  Do you want to grind peaches for hours only to be killed by some random guy for no aparent reason ? Than you would probably enjoy the mode ''Life''.  Overall , this game yanks your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ . Not to much as to where you get a friction burn ; but just enough to get you off (1-2 mins).  
727	1	a	Omg this was definitely one of the best military games I've ever played. Whether you're doing campaign or Online this game is awesome to the max. Loved the trial will be buying soon (Steam summer sale will begin shortly so don't let the 66$ price tag scare you away) :D
729	1	a	Incredible! Hours fly by while playing this. So many things to do in multiplayer, from Invade &amp; Annex (Massive COOP) to Altis Life (RP). Especially with friends its very enjoying! Don't have friends? No problem, join an already existing clan. Very good helicopter physics and the price is fair. Make sure you get the DLC bundle for the ultimate experience! Good luck, and have fun!
731	1	a	It may have it's flaws, but it is a fantastic military sim, especially when played on multiplayer.
733	1	a	This is great
735	1	a	Arma 3 beautifully continues the legacy of the Arma franchise. At no point in this game did I not stop to take in where I was. Altis and Stratis, the two maps, are stunning. The main map, Altis is very large and just that perspective alone is astounding.   If you are playing Arma for the first time, I HIGHLY recommend playing around with the editor and single player before delving in online. This is not a pick up and play type of game. There are aspects that take some time to get accustomed to and you will not get it your first time playing.   I cannot wait to see what modders have to offer in the coming months and years to make this game even better.   
737	1	a	ACE when?/10
739	1	a	9/10   A fantastic game from Bohemia Interactive, honestly the only thing lacking is some real weaponry used today. It seems a tiny bit too fictional but mods can sort that :)
741	1	a	I was planning on buying this game for an huge ammount of time, when it was in sale last week I bought it. I mostly bought it for Altis Life, but then I met the amazing modding community of Arma 3.   I bought Arma 2 for DayZ and I felt really sad when there wasn't a DayZ mod for Arma 3 (except Breaking Point). After some time playing I saw that my friend bought the game too and we played a lot together. It's really fun when you're with friends.   The game is great and it is worth it's money.
743	1	a	Was playing some Battle Royale, Going along my way, when I met a guy with an ATV he was nice enough to give me a ride, 4 guys popped out of nowhere and chunked grenades at us! we were trying to stop sence they were in front of us... so we were pretty much going 3mph, so i hit EJECT, trying to get away because niether of us had any weapons..... I then was flung over a building and got stuck in a tree, still alive then got blown into oblivion from a Frag grenade   11/10 Would get flung into a tree again
745	1	a	With over 470 hours so far in this game all I can say is awesome!!!!!!
747	1	a	By far one of the best , or even THE best FPS game i've played in a long, long time.
749	1	a	It's a very good game. It's had manny issues with performance, requieres a processor with a really good single core performance, but it's a damn good title.  It recently had a performance update, FPS went from unacceptable low with an i7 4790k and a gtx 970 to more than playable within one single patch. It's a shame the patch wasn't released earlier, as I've had a negative review for almost two years. Finaly the game runs at least somewhat decent.  It's a slower paced shooter, with a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a damn good game. The community is generally friendly, helpful towards newer players and more mature than in other games, but you will still meet idiots and jerks every now and then.  I've played it for almost 1000 hours and I still havn't grown sick of it, ther'es just so much content and mods available. It's a game well worth buying, as long as you know what you buy you won't be dissapointed.
751	1	a	It's a beautiful game. !!
753	1	a	great game 10/10 points
755	1	a	This game is so realistic, I love it. This is the game you're looking for if you search for mature players
757	1	a	Simulator for those who have reasonable good computer, 10/10 Would still play
759	1	a	This game is simply... Amazing 10/10
761	1	a	Best game ever, enough said.
763	1	a	Amazing Game Love playing it on Altis Life!! Wanna play on a good server? Altis Life of Steve is super good! 
765	1	a	AMAZING GAME, I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
767	1	a	I go to sleep comfortably every night, because I know my tovarisch loves me  10/10
769	1	a	'GET THE F*** OFF SIDE CHAT'
771	1	a	it is much more fun than watching paint dry!!!
773	1	a	i love the game, awsome map, great textures the hard thing is get used to the control
775	1	a	Arma 3 like all the rest of the series, will only offer what you put into it - after all its not really a game is it. Try the editor and learn what you are capable of doing in arma, then apply that knowledge according to what you want to see - for me - personally, i'd preffer life like realism.. and my reward - is what i've learned not to do in a real situation - how will you play arma? - Dont let my arma online XP fool you, i have been scripting in arma since moby â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was a minnow - i still dont know what its capable of - remember.. a simple quotation mark, being misplaced can make you frusterated and trying for minutes or even hours to end the script you knew only a few months ago - 8)) - i've been there - Example:   !alive nearestObject [obj1, 'House']; &lt;--- this took me 25 min to figure out that i was not putting an exclamation mark in beginning - it tells weather or not the obj is alive or not - in this case it was not and i needed to represent that - you see - simple, but it can cause discreppancy with the whole scipt not understanding what you want - so read over it always -  and yes.. i felt stupid when i finally got it right, but that is how it works. welcome to arma logic ;) i recommend arma 3 and all the rest, to anyone bored with cod or battlefield or counterstrike or what ever you need a break from - peace out -     - RenderSilent -
777	1	a	Arma 3 is jam-packed with many things to do. Although the campaign is quite slow, the multiplayer is what makes up for it. With tons of gamemodes to accomodate your own style, any type of FPS/Military fan is welcome to join the fun.
779	1	a	I have always been a fan of military simulation. The base game which offers co-op mode is already challenging as the AI sometimes can be very skilful. The amount of times you die is insane; in a chopper on the way to mission, fire fight with the AI and stepping on landmines etc.  ARMA 3 community is generally helpful and what keeps us playing is the game's ability to install add-ons and mods. They really can bring your alter-ego to life.
781	1	a	Perfect for OPERERATING OPERATIONALLY IN AN OPERATIONAL OPERATION.
783	1	a	Dear Players,  This game is absolute monster among other ones. It's superb for everyone who loves coop and open world and, moreover, it's the only game where I've found so vast and proactive modding community, I'm really amazed.  I've played Altis Life(mostly) and on private server with guys from national coop communities, I met so many fantastic people and I can't say a bad word about this game, that's for sure.  Go, give it a shot!
785	1	a	Love the game!. Havent had as much fun playing a game as I have this one in a long time. The multiplayer mod servers are where you will have the most fun at!.
787	1	a	I highly recomend this games for those ones who like simulation shooters, you have thousands of game modes such as altis life, wasteland, the campaign, etc etc. The oportunities in this games are infinites, BUT the game is not really well optimized so if you wanna play fine you will have to use a good pc.
789	1	a	ARMA 3 a Mans shooter.  Arma 3 is a greater shooter, its got a steep learning curve and lots of complex mechanics but once you get used to the game it can be great fun with an interesting enough campaign but mainly a huge amount of multiplayer mods that really make the game what it is, from life to battle royale there is something for everyone. Just note the game requires a good PC for a steady frame rate.
791	1	a	Arma 3 is an incredulous display of what THE REAL VIRTUALITYâ„¢ 4 Engine is capable of Graphically, and in sheer Scale. There have been massive improvements to the game The sound engine, animations, and even tree generation have been revamped. Also who could forget The implement of PHYSXâ„¢ and DIRECTX 11. Yes the netcode is still being worked on. Yes there are bugs in the gameplay.  'Arma' is always going to be 'Arma,' most of the 'problems' we experienced in Arma 2 are almost completely gone or un-noticeable in Arma 3. Bohemia Interactive is heading in an outstanding direction with the Arma series, Let's keep it that way.
793	1	a	This is way superior to Arma 2. Better graphics, better animations, better physics. Alot of bugs but it's to be expected on a game of this scale. However with all the mods it's one of the best game out there!
795	1	a	Comparable to minecraft in its diversity and modability while maintaining a smooth and beautiful mechanic and graphic theme. Endless options for modding but also includes a campaign and scenarios for people uninterested in mods. Once you've played Arma 3, all First Person Shooters seem to be lacking depth. I highly recommend this game.
797	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game ever! If you have ever played arma 2, you know that running into rocks was the worst! Wether in a car or on foot, the fatality rate was always 100%! But Wait theres more! If you get Arma 3, you can run into all the rocks you want! But be careful, someone decided there was an imbalance and so if you drive into a small chainlink fence, unlike in arma 2, your car has a 75% chance of exploding and a 100% chance of losing its wheels! Can't wait for Arma 4!
799	1	a	Arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points, Although it is realistic half the time you can't see your enemies because the sun is in your way.   A massive problem with Arma 3 is the AI, They are totally un-realistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an AI who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper, He stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots. At the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle.  I've never really found ArmA as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle. I like ArmA 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it. But the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play.
801	1	a	Whole lot of fun. Have yet to play the vanilla game, or the SP... the mods are amazingly cool. Wasteland is killer, and Breaking Point= DayZ for ARMA3. Graphically awesome, performance is stellar. Ballistics seem to be pretty much on point too. Vehicle control kinda sucks, but this isn't FORZA so...
803	1	a	High quality vegetation simulator with plenty of things to do
805	1	a	It's Arma 10/10
807	1	a	This game is DOPE!
809	1	a	This game offers the experience of realism in combat of modern war. There are several different types of game play you can do. Like all miltiplayers, this game escalates in fun with more people you cooperate with. The community overall is very friendly and willing to help you out if you are lost or stuck in a situation. The graphics can look really great if your machine can run it. It is both a first person and a third person shooter, helis, jets, to all sorts of ground vehicles are available for use. Each vehicle comes with their own challenges on operating them. I would recommend this game to those who are seeking a real time, realistic simulation of what it would be like to fight in the battlefied in modern times. Many variety of guns are available for use and the maps are gigantic so repetition of landscape is not an issue.  Personally I'm not the biggest arma 3 fan but this game is a solid 8/10 in my book.
811	1	a	If realism and military, cooperative warfare is what you're looking for, look no further. ArmA 3 delievers the greatest expirience to date, and it even allows you to:  -Fight a futuristic force of ants -Single handedly fight terrorism in your underwear -Fight an overwhelming force of quickly populating bunnies -Watch a guy do a backflip from a headshot  And last but not least, customize your gun and character to take on any threat to the wonderful US nation with your squad, which may involve:  -Watching your friend get mowed down in front of you -Watching your friend get blown up from an APC -Be able to do tactical drive by's -And much, much more!
813	1	a	Honestly one of the best games ive ever played between all the mods like exile and the normal game modes like king of the hill this game cannot get boring. Ive put in many hours into lots of mods and such and this is what makes the game the best, you can choose how you wanna play the game zomies or killing in a town this game has it all.
815	1	a	Realistic drug dealing experience. It's all about the hustlin. Can't never escape the Stratis ghetto. Packn' gats. Rollin past da police at 110.

817	1	a	Aswesome game , best war simulation ever , it is worth every cent .
819	1	a	 http://i.imgur.com/YQm3PT2.gif 
821	1	a	I had to add some more things to this review, as I started to appreciate it even more after some time spent in the game, both playing and creating content.   I tend to get rambly, so this is going to be a TL;DR version for you if you don't like reading textwalls: It's just awesome. Very immersive and deep, rewarding, satisfying, milsim experience.  1st episode of campaign took me 4 hours of gameplay on its own. Both multiplayer and singleplayer are great, along with the community-made content available via workshop. Looks beautiful on graphics cranked up to ultra ;) I was even able to set my sampling to 150% without any performance loss after the recent updates and I have to say - the graphics are phenomenal.  Second and third episodes of campaign were good as well, added up towards a complete story which gave me some backup on game's plot and situation on Altis in 2035. Zeus is very exciting, but it takes some practice and experience to provide players with fun time. Fatigue &amp; weapon inertia updates added a lot of depth to shooting. Now there is rotorLib to come along with shooting from vehicles, and that's going to change helo flying entirely.  See what I'm doing here? I'm proving you the devs constantly make this game better, it evolves within your eyes, and every day you play it you find something new about it, for example - recently I found out the angular size of the moon is actually correct, the night sky mapping is accurate and you can navigate using the northern star, and measure the distance using your compass and mils on it, like in real life.  Enough of this rambling. I have to say it's breathtakingly good. The possibilities it offers, the dev team which continues to add deepness to it... Some people don't like the recent updates, but for me these updates just build up more realism and add to overall greatness. And the team takes feedback into account, having really good policies both on DLCs and on new content put into the game.   Things you can do modding it are pretty crazy. I'll give you an example for better understanding: - The game itself, in vanilla version, features pretty complex ballistic mechanics. It also features exhaust pipe particle effect of hot air. What has one to do with another you might ask?  Well, a mod author took the first one, added much more deepness to create accurate ballistic simulation, and even used the particle effect I've mentioned earlier to simulate bullet trace effect in high-power optics...  Yup, you can do anything you want with this game.
823	1	a	I am a arma veteran and by far it is the game i play most and i cant wait foe the tanoa update with new weapons and vehicles . keep the good work up bohemia
825	1	a	well guess ill never get 2015 back...
827	1	a	I own/DL&amp;crack/play tons of games. My rig = 2x GTX970s + i4970 + 16GB DDR3.  This is by far the best online shooter I've ever played. The emotional experience of playing online is on par with that of the HL2 single player campaign (although the games are nothing alike.) Everything in the game is rewarding if you stick around to figure it all out. Every day I play this game I love it a little more and I've had it for about a year. Hard to get bored in MP because there are so many different roles to perform (fighter pilot vs. tank crew vs. combat medic vs. sniper vs. drone operator..etc). I get bored of games easily and this one has managed to keep my interest.  The setting and gameplay is similar to the Battlefield games, HOWEVER--  The Battlefield games are arcades. This is a MILITARY SIMULATOR. You can simulate the tedious monotony of being a plane or heli pilot, ground-pounder, medic, tank crew, +others. I prefer the helis because they are very realistic in both physics and detail, including working gauges.  I recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military simulator that is more rewarding the more you play.  I rate Arma 3 (MP) 89/100 For reference: I rate HL2 (SP) 91/100 I rate BF4 80/100 (on a good day.)
829	1	a	I love the epic in-game stuff, you can't go all Call of Duty on it or Battlefield, this is the real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 
831	1	a	This is the most solid simulator out there. The game is improved in countless ways since the previous title in the series. Name a game that can beat Arma in strategic military large-scale team play. None? I didn't think so.
833	1	a	Stairs and Heights are your worst enemy
835	1	a	Played this game for a bit, its a little fun.
837	1	a	A game that has no equal, there really is nothing quite like arma.
839	1	a	Great game!
841	1	a	It's Awesome!!! 
843	1	a	There is NOTHING, I mean NOTHING like ARMA. This is really and 'endless' game. The mod community is robust and VERY active. Everything, and ANYTHING is possible in ARMA III. This is what PC gaming is all about! Watch this video for a better example.    
845	1	a	Probably one of the best games i've played on steam. First there was the brilliance of Arma 2 and now there is the perfection I call Arma 3. King of the hill is great if you like team based game modes. Altis is fun but hard to get started in and wasteland is fun if you like survival or deathmatch. And just like Arma 2 the community has made amazing mods
847	1	a	Arma 3 is the greatest game ever made.  I did a 500m crawl to an abandoned radio tower on the top of a hill overlooking a village. Once my spotter and I got there he began calling out targets as he glassed the town with his binoculars searching for our target, a war criminal wearing a black beret and aviators, known as 'The Jackal'. Once we found our mark we compared him to our notes and the descriptions matched. I noted his location and then marked a right triangle on our map, finding that I was 320m North and 340m west of his position, the hypotenuse of the triangle was 467m (our distance). Then accounting for a 160m height differential between the target and I, our actual distance was 493m. Due to a slight Northern wind of about 5kph I adjusted my shot slightly to the right, I took the shot, striking the target in the right shoulder, killing him instantly.    I had to use geometry and trig to play a video game.  I approve 100%
849	1	a	This is a great game, very in-depth shooter.
851	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game to have ever graced the Steam store. Anyone doubtful about the legitimacy of this claim have clearly never played Arma before. Buy this game, and don't think twice about it.
853	1	a	One of the most realistic Military Simulators I have ever played. I have always loved the 'ARMA' Series, but this game is incredible. I especially love it for the Editor and Virtual Arsenal features. The new Engine it uses creates amazing visuals and effects. The modding capabilities in this extends the amount of weapons, gear, units, maps and vehicles, and even full conversion mods, to make it even more amazing than it already is. It is a great game to play with friends if you like the idea of being tactical. Buy it now.
855	1	a	I 10000% recomend this game.
857	1	a	Just finished the loading screen.  11/10 would load again.
859	1	a	Killed a cop, stole his car, got chased by 3 cars, died.  10/10 would do again
861	1	a	Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.  First of all, some history.  All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates. Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time. ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game. ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today. Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.  The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.  It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.  Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.  First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.  As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.  And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job. Here's a very good Altis Life server:  http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/   With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.  As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.  As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others. Here's a very good Wasteland server:  https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/   With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies. Sign up to play here:  http://www.thezombieinfection.com/   Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.  It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.  If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.  https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3official   Thanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!  Frank
863	1	a	This is the most buggy, broken game i have ever played. Yet i can't stop playing it... You Win BiS
865	1	a	The Playtime speaks for itself really....
867	1	a	Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into another city looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to a town. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic 'You suck at shooting!' Nearing at the town i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream 'WAIT!'... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said 'no need. we have both lost something.' He put the gun down. 'We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said 'Thank you..' at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body.  Then i respawned
869	1	a	Awesome, just awesome, with a huge load of bugs :D  If you like military simulations you gonna have a lot of fun.
871	1	a	Brilliant army simulator, it offers so much more than just the base game. WIth custom missions workshop. and fully mod-able. its deffo a good buy. amazing for co op, multiplayer and single player. a massive improvement on arma 2.
873	1	a	This an amazing military simulator with so many things to do! You can make your own battles on the editor, play the story line, or get mods and other missions that the ArmA III Community made! I wasn't sure about buying at first but now I'm glad I bought it!
875	1	a	Very tactical team based game!
877	1	a	best. game. ever. If you like battlefield but hate it for the things, you'll absolutely enjoy this game!
879	1	a	A3 is a great tactical army sim, has so much to do it is very hard to get bored. great community (in places) and great mods available via ArmAholic. Granted it has its bugs (like the rest) but they are slowly but surely fixing it.  9/10. Would recommend to anyone
881	1	a	Recommended to anyone who canÂ´t stand CoD. Please stay away if you believe that DayZ made ARMA III possible. Anyone else - go get it!
883	1	a	i felt like i was in a real war and it was scary, i lost all of my squad to the sand nazis and it was a sad hella chopper ride home with out my team but what a blast  10/7.5 - IGN
885	1	a	Nice RPG game keep on the good work  
887	1	a	one of the best games played!
889	1	a	Picture yourself standing in the middle of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nowhere then having to run 60 miles to get home, you picturing that? Well the game should really be called Arma 3 the real jogging simulator or dream smasher because let me tell ya you run for that long and get some cool gear, you're probably gonna get killed
891	1	a	OVERVIEW  Arma3 is the flagship of realistic modern day combat FPS. This game beats me up left right and center with it's mind blowing realism, and I just keep playing regardless of the pain! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes realism and is ready for a seriously fun challenge.  ------------------------------------ MULTIPLAYER  First off, online play is awesome, even breathtaking if played right! There are many server hosters, mostly active during holiday seasons, who host massive scale role playing games. Even real life off-duty soldiers like to play this game, and quite often. In these scenarios, things are co-ordinated like real life operations by real life people, in real time. And these missions are 100% flexible, you can carry it out as you see fit! Or as your commanding officer sees fit.  HQ making the big decisions and laying down orders. Fireteams taking the orders down on the ground. Mechanised rolling armoured support. CAS providing support from the air. Recon taking the long shots. Diving teams, etc.  And every contributing player is a real person! No AI on your side. (For the Roleplaying Player vs AI missions)  There are also many other game modes to choose from. Deathmatch, King of the hill, even racing! And if not even that satisfies you, then you could just browse the workshop for other types of game modes. If you are a fan of DayZ then head over and download the Exile mod. Its very similar.  ------------------------------------ SINGLEPLAYER  There is a Singleplayer playmode called The Eastern Winds, where NATO fights for control of Altis after they lose control of it to CSAT forces. With the help of native populus you work your way up fighting with FIA till you are able to rejoin your NATO comrades.  The story mode is really great, and very long. Its flexibility could also leave space to play missions in a different way if you would like to.  ------------------------------------ STEAM WORKSHOP  The mods for this game are endless! Anything from extra weapons to a mod that makes helicopter flight even more realistic. Mods that give you new vehicles or clothes, to mods that add missions or overhaul game systems.  All mods are easily accessed from the game launcher so its not hard to turn them on and off at your own leisure. Some mods are not accepted on some servers.  ------------------------------------ PROS &amp; CONS  Pretty much everything above is a Pro, so I would use this space to talk about the cons. Pretty much the biggest problems in this game are cosmetic glitches. This includes things like falling into walls and through 2 story houses. Though most of your time is spent in the field, you should be careful moving between buildings.  Another thing is that the AI can be very dumb, like driving over teammates. And the AI is capable of spotting you through a keyhole over a 800m distance. It seems like it's getting better over time so I have faith in that! For me, it's just more of a challenge. Just don't engage at range with a pistol against the AI, you will have a hard time.  ------------------------------------ MAKE ARMA NOT WAR &lt;3
893	1	a	Drove really fast in a tank and flipped it 10 outta 10 for best tanks.
895	1	a	It's like ARMA3 is your kid, it has it's flaws and constantly tests your patience. But you love it anyways.
897	1	a	Stay low, Move fast. Kill first, Die last. One shot, One kill. No luck, ALL SKILL.
899	1	a	The only series that my mod folder is larger than the game.
901	1	a	worth Â£40 not much else to say.
903	1	a	The only series that my mod folder is larger than the game.
905	1	a	Played a few hours. It's fun. 6969
907	1	a	Best military simulator ever.  After 2 years: Bugs, bugs, bugs.
909	1	a	-stole cop car -crashed cop car -died  fun game 10/10
911	1	a	...I'm still playing this game.
913	1	a	4000 Hours in,  This game is 'meh'
915	1	a	Best game for coop.
917	1	a	This is a really great game, I've enjoyed the arma series and with more optimizations this game runs better and looks nice. The physics are very good and not as glitchy as arma 2 but it still needs work. They are also still adding more features to the game and adding frequent updates.
919	1	a	This is a really great game, I've enjoyed the arma series and with more optimizations this game runs better and looks nice. The physics are very good and not as glitchy as arma 2 but it still needs work. They are also still adding more features to the game and adding frequent updates.
921	1	a	I rate this game I-S, for Insense and Stressful.  &gt;be playing Epoch mod with a friend &gt;find this nice Taru helicopter &gt;find a truck &gt;go to tow said truck &gt;lifting off with the truck hanging under us &gt;lower rotor breaks and goes into the red for absolutely no reason &gt;Taru starts spinning out of control &gt;freaking out as friend tries to safely navigate what is essentially a spinning rock from the air to the ground without murdering us &gt;five minutes of cardiac arrest-inducing stress later and we safely land &gt;get out to assess damage &gt;get shot dead &gt;10/10 would play again
923	1	a	If you are considering buying Arma 3 for the multiplayer there are a few things you should know... About the multiplayer: There are several modes of multiplayer. There's Life, which is like an role playing type scenario. There's Wasteland, which is like DayZ but without zombies. There's also the several military combat oriented multiplayer modes. Multiplayer can be rewarding, but the Arma community is extremely diverse in the way people play their game. There are some casual players, but you will also encounter real military simulation enthusists. If you like to have fun, I suggest you approach the latter group with some degree of caution. They're not all bad, but I have run into some that have Units (Arma's term for clans) that do uniform inspections, boring training and, in one case, would not admit women to their unit because it wasn't 'realistic'. Just remember, if you're not having fun then it isn't worth your time and you should immediately ditch those people that are being such a drag. Other then that, the multiplayer can get quite laggy, but you can usually find another server to play on if that's the case. And bring a book because you can expect a lot of downtime in some modes of multiplayer.  The game itself is a bit buggy. It can break your immersion at times, but when it really counts (in firefights) it rarely glitches out on me. This is a CPU intensive game. If you have a so-so processor but a good video card you may have to do some tweeks to make the game run in a satisfactory manner.  Overall, I enjoy it a bunch. There's a lot to learn and I'm quite happy with the game.
925	1	a	This game never got old ... its evolving all the time
927	1	a	Probably the most realistic combat simulator for better or worse. A vast open island where you're all alone and an ambush could happen at any moment. Not a fast paced shooter at all and not meant to be.
929	1	a	If you are looking for a shooter game, look no further. This game will challenge you, embrace you, and entertain you for years to come. The detail, the immersement, the feelings you get when playing this game is unlike any other game out there.  You have to play it... Once you do, there won't be any other shooter that will be on par with Arma 3.
931	1	a	Alright now, Been seeing alot of whining about the game is not optimized and that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, YOU have to consider, this is no Lightweight game, this game will run havoc on your CPU if you don't have a strong CPU, this is a Simulator game top tier of its class, you cannot expect to run on full Ultra 60 FPS with loads of mods and scripts in certain missions, This is an extremely demanding game, It's very hard to optimize this kind of games, This is not Battlefield Hardlines in a Sandbox styled gameplay, This game is running on one of the worlds most demaning CPU, GPU and RAM engine's. And a 3-4 year old AMD CPU ain't gonna get you really far in this game, There alot of point's and factors here and there. This is just simply a demanding game ashell, Well enough about that.  This game is extremely fun and good to play, You have lots of mods and tools you can use and play in this game. This game is definently an improvment since Arma 2 (And Arma 2 Is EVEN WORSE Optimized). I really can't tell and I really won't or care to tell much about the game in all aspects but I can give a short brief idea of the game. This is a Military Simulation game kinda, It is an open world driven game, this game also has a Mission Editor ready for use, you can make missions and campaigns and whatever (aslong as you know how ;D ) Game is fairly fun and there alot of servers with different tons of game modes like Altis Life, Domination, Capture The Island, King of the Hill, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and so on. the game includes 3 Campaign Episodes that are quite interesting to play. Bohemia Interactive does a great job supporting the game and updating it. oh by the way. there exists a Zeus Player, Well there are some missions that includes Zeus, Zeus is a entity that a player can be. the Zeus function in the sense that you can make missions in real time while everyone is playing on the server, The Zeus can choose either to help or oppose the other players, by spawning in enemies or smite them with lighting strikes and so on. You can also use the Zeus in the Editor. All in all this game is definently worth the money, IF your PC can run it properly. K thx bye!
933	1	a	this game gives you a dnokey boner when you attack dose dam greeks
935	1	a	People complain about the price, the first CoD on Steam is still $20. People complain about the lag, but I don't have this problem and I do not have a gaming PC. Just look a bit deeper, edit your settings better, and fix your launch parameters. People complain about the DLC, that's countless man hours put into making them for you, especially the marksman DLC with the new models, animations, vests, all the ambient objects. And the helicopter DLC, with all the new objects for making even more detailed bases, the new flight model, the ropes with actual physics. None of this stuff HAD to be made for your enjoyment, they could have released skins and announcer packs or remade their maps to sell as DLC *cough* Treyarch and DICE *cough*. (god forbid they put a pricetag on their time, with all the free updates they make such as Zeus and Eden too) They have a modding community with their old maps, missions, new maps, editors, new models, skins, weapons, animations, scripts, vehicles, effects and more and those are in the thousands. So, before listening to the complaints that everyone thinks is actually a valid complaint, listen to all the things that are fixing it, and making them better.
937	1	a	ARMA 3 is a tactical based military simulator with many features. You can play alone or in a team, it's entirely up to you. There are many server's that allow various gamemodes - even custom gamemodes and modservers. The choice of many helo's and vehicles of any kind make ARMA 3 immersive and realistic. One of my favourite gamemodes is a roleplay based mode, called Altis Life. There are two main islands in ARMA 3: Altis and Stratis. The goal of Altis Life is making money and interacting with other players. You can also play as a cop or a medic and much more, depending on your taste.
939	1	a	I guess it's kinda good
941	1	a	This is by far the best game I have. It is so versatile it can be so many different things. The environment is huge and rivals most any other game in the genre. This is literally a war simulator complete with a mission editor. This game has given me the most fun with my friends for the dollar (besides Minecraft)
943	1	a	Great game worth every penny one of my favorites games of all time
945	1	a	power of arma is in modding and community, it is improved a lot since previous titles and BIS will support its development further.   (good side) nice graphics improvement from arma 2, the game has an editor that let you do what you want on a huge map and multiplayer is fun.   (bad side) The campaign is ok, fps drop in towns and the game is hard for beginners and bad vechiles physics.    conclusion   Best military simulation I have ever played, and possible one of the best games.
947	1	a	really awesome game 10/10 way better than arma 2
949	1	a	Robbed a guy for $1. 10/10
951	1	a	10/10 would buy again
953	1	a	Arma 3 is the Best Game :D
955	1	a	first downloaded it, then i thought after 1500 hours with friends LAN and in the editor: this is a great game i should buy it. BEST DECISION EVER!
957	1	a	Rate this game 20/10 i love it. i have 452 hours and it keeps going up :)   i would buy this game at any price
959	1	a	The latest installment for the military simulation franchise which has been around for eons is a very nice step in the right direction in general. Arma 3 Features two new maps called Stratis (which can be compared to Utes of Arma 2) and Altis, which is a mammoth sized map that stretches roughly 27 kilometers in East to West length. The Arma series has been prone to a multitude of bugs and poor optimization, which is still evident in the latest insatllment, yet the optimization has been FAR improved in this version of Bohemia Interactive's spotlight franchise. The graphics in this game are very improved and look beautiful on Ultra settings (that is, if you can run it). This game is still prone to glitches, bugs and sudden extreme drops of framerate without warning. Some of the bugs are eveident in player movent, which has been vastly improved upon the last installment, allowing you to take on 9 tactical positions when shooting. The movement is far less clunky and works much smoother than Arma 2. Some of the movement bugs can mean that you accidentally can get stuck in a rock or wall and end up dying from being squashed. The vehicles have been greatly improved offering far more realistic physics (however the physics are not on the par of games like Forza 5) with realistic vehicle speeds. The vehicles on the other hand are painstakingly delicate and fragile than before making vehicle operating quite frustrating at times. The weapon mechanics have been totally overhauled since the previous Arma game with new damage mechanics and far more realistic recoil effects. Arma 3 also has added a new dimension to its already diverse playability, adding a more in depth (no pun intended) maritime experience. This allows you to dive to the depths of th eocean and use submarises as well. Some of the things I want to see in Arma 3 are missing such as the ability to take cover behind doors of a vehicle whilst riding in it to avoid being shot easlliy (for example, if you are driving or in the passenger seat of a car you can hold a button to allow you character to switch into 1st person view and duck behind the dashboard and door of the car). Another missing feature is the ability to shoot in vehicles with you character's weapons allowing for military simmulation dirve-bys. My final verdict of Arma 3 is a very solid 8.5 out of 10. Arma 3 offers a very vast and expansive game that has a nearly infinite replayability, yet some of its bugs and optimization hold back Bohemia Interactive's flagship series back once more. If these glitches were to be fixed Arma 3 could be a very famous game that could be a serious threat to games like the Call of Duty franchise or Battlefield franchise as well. Buying this game is a choice you will not regret and with a little time and patience, you can have a blast on this game.
961	1	a	I have a love hate for this game. Dont get me wrong this by far best mil sim out here other than 'Project Reality 1.0' when it comes to PVP. With mods that offered in  ArmAholic.com  and many missons that offered in workshop this game can quite addicting i mean you can spend hours among hours on ArmA 3. i almost was late for work cause i was having so much enjoyment with this game. One thing i don't understand why they will charge so much for this game i got it for 20 bucks on  {LINK REMOVED}  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.net .  my only cons are:  - The Braindead (dont care about it own life nor teammates) AI i spend hours on hours looking online for Ai Mods for this game to better my play exp. -Not many Jets  -Not many weapons right out the box (go to  armaholic.com  for weapons packs)  -Server Broswer it just hell of a mess -Still a bit unoptimized -This Game is more CPU focused then GPU so have a good CPU and your good to go  -Needs a better VOIP system -Needs to teamup with Punkbuster  -The Island just dont seems right for the current confilct offered in the game  -Wish there was a life walking around 'women' and men etc walking around  -Wish not every town look the same    But be smart dont throw 60 bucks at this look around for deals like i got   {LINK REMOVED}  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.net   Cheapdigitaldownload.com  100% legit
963	1	a	With over 3,100 hours, I think I am more than qualified to tell you about the game.   So, what is ArmA 3? ArmA 3 is a tactical fps/third person shooter simulator. Quite a mouthful huh? ArmA 3, I would have to say is by far the best game I have ever played, and until ArmA 4 comes out, the best game I will ever play. Bohemia has truelly one upped most, if not all, shooting games out there to date. And with the mature, professional community that plays ArmA 3, it is not hard to find excellent modifications to the game. Some of the best community game mods I can recommend to you right now are Altis Life and ArmA 3 Life.   However, should you find yourself more interested in the tactical side of ArmA, there are units out there that replicate real world military units, that provide tactical gameplay, as well as assisting you to better yourself in the field of ArmA 3. But before you go do anything, be sure to play the campaign, as that will help you learn ArmAs mechanics, and assist you in your career of ArmA. While I myself am still looking for a role play server. There are plenty of MilSim units out there though. 173rd Airborne Brigade, 15th MEU. Currently I am apart of the 173rd and can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it. Recruiting Now.   TeamSpeak IP: ts3.173rd.us  Website Link:  http://beta.173rd.us/index.php? 
965	1	a	The ArmA series stole my life 4 years ago, and continues to do so.  10/10
967	1	a	Good single player, great coop multiplayer...when it works. The servers are rather sketchy, they don't run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience. Just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! But, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. But, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. Most people only play Altis Life, the role playing section of the game, which I'd rather just play GTA online. If this is on sale, buy it. Wouldn't shell out the full $60 on it though. If you love tactical games such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six, this is your game. All in all 8/10.
969	1	a	I killed a man with 0 thought.... found out he was friendly then I was running away rouge with the threat of being court marshalled held over my head. Then I found this great game and now I play it.  10/10 would shoot sarge again.

973	1	a	My oh my this game is incredible.  Bohemia, give yourself a pat on the back. The upgrade from Arma 2 to Arma 3 is astonishing. The graphics! The gameplay! The multiplayer!  STEAM WORKSHOP COMPATABILITY!  Love this game, very replayable due to the aforementioned caps locked sentence above.  Thoroughly enjoy this title and I do recommend for any fan of the Arma series.  No noobs though. I'm aiming at you Call of Duty fanboys! ;)  9/10.  Cons: From Arma 2 to Arma 3 I would of liked to have seen better and more user friendly weapon switching.. Yes I know it's realistic but it does get irritating :)
975	1	a	Gonna be the best ever....already great.
977	1	a	I never expected i would get into these kind of games, im really the last one who is playing millitary simulations but with some guys the kind of the hill mode is really fun. If you never tried the game you should try it BUT a big but  the game is horribly optimized, it crashes often, low fps, laggy.
979	1	a	A realistic Military Simulator, this game is worth a buy. With the ability to create your own missions with the amazing editor and to play others with the in-built workshop support, you can have endless hours of enjoyment with this game. It's quite realistic, but still lacks many features of military warfare that could be put into the game. The graphics ain't so good on my computer but that's because my computer is 8 years old and I will be upgrading soon so I will be able to see this game at it's full potential.  This was my first game in the Arma series, followed by Arma 2 (We don't speak of Cold War Assualt). From my experience with Arma 2 this game doen't differ enormously, bar graphics of course. However, it does have some features that are not present in Arma 2, and I frequently notice these features missing when playing Arma 2. If you are new to the Arma series get this game but if you are a long time veteran then maybe wait a little untill you get bored of all the mods on Arma 2.  This is a perfect game for any person who enjoys military combat games or would like a realistic simulation of military combat and life. Worth a buy in my opinion.  8/10  P.S. I haven't played a lot of this game at the current time because it doesn't run so well on my computer and I can only spawn a few units without intense framerate drops.
981	1	a	If you even manage to get one kill, you will feel like the greatest soldier on the planet. That is, until the rest of the enemy army finds you and kills you from a mile away.
983	1	a	One of my favourite games in my library. Still has some glitches but is best to play with friends.
985	1	a	Pros  - Very Well Optimised  - Amazing Mod Support  - Massive Maps - Fantastic Graphics  Cons  - Dated Engine - No Australian Servers For My Favourite Mod (Battle Royal) - Horrible Community - Slow Dev Support   Fantastic Game If Played With Friends Defenetly Worth A Buy
987	1	a	The greatest game/simulation ever!  kid play COD, boy play battle field, man play arma I played arma for near 2000 hour and I decided to write a review now. As a player who saw all the development and effort of Bohemia Interactive, the online player number maintain so long that exceed my previous expectation! This can't be done without all the players' love and effort from Bohemia!
989	1	a	A game close to my heart. Shows the best and worst of PC gaming.
991	1	a	Accidently shot some civilians in a village so i cried because it was so realistic. Then i donated 2 euros to some charity to make it even. 10/10
993	1	a	very loud indoor sounds with army men with big loud guns who shoot and kill you without even seeing you and why do i need to press every key on my keyboard in a certain order just to reload nothing makes any sense also war dads who take this game very seriously and will get mad if you call their squad lame and say yours is better and cooler
995	1	a	  Brief Review    Arma 3 from Bohemia Interactive is the latest in its military simulation series of games, which began with the original Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis.   While shipping with a small amount of actual content, that is not what Arma 3 or the Arma franchise is all about. The huge influx of Steam Workshop content, multiplayer and editor make this a full package for the most serious of combat simulator nuts    Pros and Cons     Pros   New vehicle physics are great Butterfly shadows Massive world to explore with lots of potential for long-range engagements (270 kmÂ²) Extremely detailed, lush visual presentation Hyper-realistic combat will satisfy even the most die-hard sim enthusiasts Huge variety in terms of gameplay scenarios    Cons   Controls feel clunky Very steep learning curve You will need a new PC (Most likely)    An Ending    Arma as a franchise is class leading at what it does - Military simulation refined and mastered
997	1	a	NICE SANDBOX GAME,I HOPE THE NEW DLC 'TANOA' WILL BE FREE FOR EVERY ARMA3 USER.
999	1	a	best game in my life
1001	1	a	very loud indoor sounds with army men with big loud guns who shoot and kill you without even seeing you and why do i need to press every key on my keyboard in a certain order just to reload nothing makes any sense also war dads who take this game very seriously and will get mad if you call their squad lame and say yours is better and cooler
1003	1	a	Great game, amazing gameplay and visually fantastic. One thing to know about this game before you buy it. It is not COD. If you're looking for a game like that, dont buy this... 
1005	1	a	best tactical game ever
1007	1	a	THIS GAME MAKES ME SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MOIST  YIFF/YIFF WOULD RECCOMEND
1009	1	a	Endless fun with a huge variety of community made maps.. when and if you get sick of the content provided.
1011	1	a	Best tactical shooter on the market. 10/10
1013	1	a	This game is awesome, buy it !!! 9/10
1015	1	a	This game Is very fun and awesome. The graphics are insanely good, The attachment and clothing system is very cool, And this game is just plain out awesome. I'd recommend it to those who are fans of ARMA II or Military Simulators. Overall rating of this game for me is a 10/10.
1017	1	a	Kicked off the game [Battle-Eye Client Not Responding]
1019	1	a	great game takes a lot of power so if you dont have a powerful computer or laptop i would not recommend because it takes alot of power to truly experience
1021	1	a	Great game. Lots of popular mods, great modding community, will be around for a long time.
1023	1	a	Awesome game I hope they improve on it more though
1025	1	a	10/10, its bretty gud. MP is still broken performance wise on gamemodes like invade&amp;annex (AKA domination)
1027	1	a	600 Hours plus. Epic game.
1029	1	a	Fantastic game. The single player content, showcases and training are good. The real meat of the game is in its multiplayer though. Admittedly, it can be a bit confusing at first if you're a new player, as some servers require you to download mods before you can join the server. There doesn't tend to be a whole lot of 'vanilla' servers out there. However, the mods are fantastic and worth the effort, especially if you play them with a group of people.  My favorite experience thus far was when we were playing the 'Insurgency' mod (military vs terrorists). There's a mod called Task Force Radio, which in a nut shell provides much more realistic radios to use. Each faction has their own encrypted radio, various channels you can switch to and various ranges of radio (long range and short range). As the military, we were attempting to locate intel that was known to exist in a village. A squad was unfortunately KIA, and for the next two hours, the military was getting picked off constantly. I even deployed with a buddy deep into a mountain with full camo, let my team know that where I was and I had good sights on the village, and not 2 minutes later I got sniped even though I was hardly exposed and never took a shot. Later, it turns out they stole a radio off a dead squadmate and were listening to our radio chatter and our positions for 2 hours and we all had a good laugh as the terrorists won.  10/10
1031	1	a	Well what i can tell, Arma 3 its one of my favorite games of all time and i have with my 1800play hours the right to say that this game is one of the best games of alltime. Here are some reasons why.  The game has a great community of modders and contentcreators its a game you can really play for ever and i can just recommend it to everyone im sure you find something you like.  Enjoy ;)
1033	1	a	Do you hate COD, are you sick of Battlefield? seeking the next level!? Arma 3 is it. I am a veteran of this game series and i can safely say that Arma 3 is the the best war game ever.   10/10  TRooper.
1035	1	a	My in game hours is my review :D
1037	1	a	just waiting for a m8
95	0	a	im sorry but this game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, its terribly optimized and barely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing works. i played this on my travel rig (GTX 680 with a i7 4770k) and it could hardly get 30 fps on low in a city. This game feels unfinished and extremely unpolished.
1039	1	a	Spending enough time in this game to fully appreciate the good and the bad, I have decided to put some words down. I love this game more than any other game that comes to mind.  Where do I start? I'll start with the hard stuff.  You will stuggle with this game. You will have moments where you hate the way it's coded. You will die to stupid things, like stairs or rocks. You will hate the fatigue system and the weapon sway. You will get annoyed at the reskins for outfits.  Eventually, you will mod it.  This is not a simple run and gun game. You will not find yourself 'no scoping' after sprinting for 2 kliks. Arma 3 is a simulator first and a game second. The groundwork is solid for the most part. The modding community is devoted. The game modes are varied. There is something that almost everyone will find appealing inside this package.  Halo jumping dressed like the UK Special Forces? Check. Thank a modder. Driving a hatchback that's colored like the American flag? Check. Thank a modder. Want to build a mission around the Tet Offensive? Check. Thank a modder.  Am I biased? Yes. Do I have a huge amount of respect for modders? Yes.  Arma 3 is a cpu intensive game. You will have to tweek the hell out of it to make it just right. You aren't going to get 60 fps on poorly coded MP servers. Please don't think it's your hardware, it's not. Well, probably not. But this game really shines in the graphic department once she's setup just right. I'm constantly trying to squeeze as much performance as possible, but I'm not going to go over everything I've done, it would take too long. If you google it, you will find it.  Playing the game by yourself is hindering your fun to an extent I can't even explain. Ok, since you asked so nicely, I'll try.  Playing to campaign alone left me yearning for more. I really disliked the interface when assigning targets, or handing out orders to the AI squadmates I had been shackled with. It doesn't feel very fluid, nor does it give me the feeling of teamwork. The AI, at times, can go 'full â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' and just stand there while being mowed down by the enemy forces. You may order them to get into the truck you're sitting in, only to find one of them has the great idea to run right into the AO and alert everyone to your presence. Ok, I guess stealth is off the table. At least I have superior numbers? Ha, they won't get out of the truck and that rpg is headed this way. I'll just reload my save then.  Now, replay that with real people that communicate and know how to play. Completely different outcome. I'm not typing that hypothetical situation out again, just trust me.  Now, onto the really fun part. That part that makes my genitals tingle.   The Mods.  OMG Becky, look at those mods. They're so big! No, they aren't all large downloads. Even some of the smallest mods can change the game to a large extent.  Take AGM for example. It has different frag throwing options. A medical system that includes epi's, blood bags, adrenaline and the ability to drag people to safety. No longer can you see how many rounds are left in your mag, you can only 'see' the weight. It has weapon resting, fast roping, cook offs, vehicle repair options and a bunch of other things I can't think off.  What about vehicles? I really like the hummvees from Arma 2. There are a few different options for mods for that. Do you hate that you stop moving when you switch weapons? There's a mod for that. Tactical glasses have no use in the game? There's a mod that gives you a hud when wearing the glasses in first person. I hate the stock sounds. JSRS3 baby! Want a Canadian mohawk? Reskin mod. Tired of playing Altis or Stratis? Bornholm, Tilos, Chernobyl, Chernarus, Utes, Panthera. Just to name a few of the many user made maps available with a few clicks.  Be warned. Mods don't always work 'right out of the boxâ„¢'. If you don't have patience, you're just going to have a bad time. Sometimes mods don't work well with each other, or give you graphical errors, or aren't compatible with user made missons. In short, when they work, oh baby do they. When they don't, you deal with it or stop using them.  Look, I'm biased. I really am. I love the milsim aspect of this game. I love the squad play. I love the vehicles and the guns. I love the guys I play with.  They say that the best things in life are the things you have to work for. That's what Arma 3 is.  You have to work for it. But it really shines in the long run.
1041	1	a	Good    -Realistic (compared to cod or bf) -Fun with friends  -Tons of gamemodes  -Good graphics -Plenty of mods    Bad  -Overpriced DLC -Low fps (aka the game is not optimised) -Probably too difficult for new players to understand how to play
1043	1	a	Game had great introduction and I had fun. But I don't know what it says about war game when the most fun part was the driving parts... There was also lot of lag and frame rate kept jumping. I also had problems with achievements so that they did not come up when I got them but late or not at all. Game had problems but I still recommend it because it was fun and had good story.
1045	1	a	The main reason why I bought Arma3 was for the Wasteland mod. I played Arma 2 pretty heavily and I can say for sure that Arma3/Wasteland is far superior than DayZ in every respect except for survival/foraging. I played quite a bit of Arma2 Dayz and I feel that the mod is extremely overrated compared to the other MP experiences Arma has to offer.  This review may be more helpful to those who are thinking about the decision to move to Arma3 from Arma2.  Arma 3 improves upon Arma 2 in many ways. First it reduces the amount of clutter on the keyboard. Now there isn't (what feels like) fifty keys dedicated to command/radio and now there is more of a streamlined feel to the game. That being said, it's extremely necessary to play with voice, as calling out targets/orders is something that is required in this game, unless you are a lone wolf or you are in a rather large group where the need for such things is lessened.  Also, a major update in graphics, which I must say are stunning compared to A2. This doesn't make Arma, but it helps you stay immersed. Needless to say, Arma will  always  be unoptimized, so please, learn simple optimization tricks before giving up after seeing you have &lt;30 frames. It's worth it.  The amount of customizations in this game is extremely helpful/useful. Be warned though, it may take some time before you get the hang of it as Arma, being buggy, has a tendency to make things hard. Plus there's the fact that sometimes a player can get their hands on a fantastic sniper rifle, minus the scope (I'm pointing at you wasteland). So be warned of these situations before you find yourself in one that isn't to your liking.  After all of this I would suggest that people with lower end computers don't buy this game or be prepared to run it on low settings. But the low settings are nothing to be mad about, as they are still pretty damn good, and graphics are not something that you come to Arma for in the first place.   Now for those who haven't experienced the Military Sim feels (you know what I'm talking about)... Arma. Delivers. When played right, it delivers a deep comradery that cannot be gotten from most other games on the market. When you achieve something with your friends, who you sometimes have to place 100% trust in, it can be awe inspiring and can lead to many ecstatic shouts over the radio for doing something seemingly insignificant if seen through eyes of a standard FPS player.  Now about gameplay; Arma requires an extreme amount of patience. Normally you have one or two rounds of fire to get things right or you will be sent to the death screen. Bullets hurt. Really bad. Normally getting hit with one is life threatening if it's normal caliber, but any more than that and you could be facing a bit of a journey back. This normally means 10-20 minutes to regroup and find another battle worth fighting. But don't worry, many of my fondest memories of Arma are from moments that are just random and unexpected, and they don't even require the slightest trace of enemy presence. (  http://i.imgur.com/GgapTFX.jpg  ) &lt;- From Arma2   TL;DR Arma 3 is a much improved upon Arma 2, nothing extremely new here but there's still quite a bit more which makes it worth getting if your computer can handle the game and you can handle the buggyness/playstyle of Arma. It is one of my favorite games and is the leader of its genre, and rightfully so.  For those wondering approximately 300 hours of game time logged on Arma2.
1047	1	a	They fixed fatigue and a worth while DLC is on the way. Who died and took over? ----------------------------------- [Fatigue Update] This has ruined the game. I'm not even exagerating. Unless you only use vehicles 24/7 this update will have ruined the game for you, making you aim like a drunkard after jogging about all of 10m and forcing you to walk at a snails pace after a whole 20m. That's some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing wonderful realism, isn't it guys. ----------------------------------- If I had to compare Arma 3 to another game, I'd say its the grandchild of Battlefield and Skyrim. With massive-scale combat, maps that dwarf any other shooter without question, and a variety of user-made game modes along with the vanilla series of Zeus game modes there is no shortage of content. In the recently added Zeus modes you can even turn this first-person shooter into an RTS game.  The game mechanics are mostly solid however some minor things such as falling damage, parachute mechanics, and cars/trucks turning to useless wrecks after a realtively minor bump into anything leave plenty of room for improvement. Bugs are also still a signifigant issue, even to the point of causing some destroyed buildings to randomly shoot someone into the air and have them fall to their death. And in general, the engine feels stiff.  Much like Skyrimâ€”issues asside, if you find the right game mode for you, almost anyone should be able to find some enjoyment out of Arma 3. Whether you're some hardcore-roleplaying type, want to fight for survival all over an island, or simply want to vie for control over a city; there is plenty to do.
96	0	a	This game is huge. It has endless possibilities. It COULD provide lots of fun but what happens in the end, is the absolutely poorly optimized engine which completely fails to deliver smooth experience. I own a 980GTX + i7 and 16gig of ram and no matter what settings I set up, I always get 20-30 fps, and in intense firefights it slows to a miserable 10-15. The game was launched back in 2013 and it really hurts to see Bohemia fail to deliver a smooth experience for everyone. Its a joke, really. Almost two years and we still have these problems. Shame.
97	0	a	I played this game back when it was the free game for the weekend. I never purchased it afterwards, and you'll probably figure out why from both my review and those of others.   So, as anyone could reasonably expect, I was pretty excited for this game to be free for the weekend, as I've had my eye on it for almost a year! As an avid ARMA II fan, I had always been a little dissapointed with the lack of more modern military tech in an otherwise great game. I thought ARMA 3 would whisk all my problems away and carry me into ARMA heaven. It didn't quite work out like that though...  So upon launch the first thing that struck me as odd was the lack of info. Sure, the menus are much more appealing to the eye, but the tutorials were some weird lovechild of a campaign and a quest-system. It was very strange, so much so that I neglected to finish the first one. 'Oh well,' I thought. 'I've played enough ARMA II to figure out how to handle myself.'  And for the most part I was right. I jumped into the campaign and it was fun! So why the negative review? Well, the campaign was fun for a little bit, but after that 'new game smell' wore off, it wasn't much to brag about. I moved on, and played some tank match which I can't remember too many details about, other than a few key things. First off, everything was insanely grey. Now I understand the use of dynamic lighting and warzone fog and stuff like that, but this was just rediculous. So, as I was cruising around with my platoon of Slammers, we encountered some enemies! Great! Let's see how this works! So to sum that up, there's unique and dynamic damaged/dead unit models depending on their style of demise, the radio chatter no longer sounds like a panicking android but a much cleaner soldier, and vehicle control is no longer a reinactment of the mountain scene in Tokyo Drift.  But, what I couldn't get over was the lack of diversity. Oh look, Slammers. Hey, more slammers. Oh, a Wolverine (I think). And OMG another slammer. What I'm getting at is that, unlike its predicessor, ARMA 3 has no vast, game-changing DLCs (other than Karts, but that isn't even military.) So what you end up with is this massive tropical island turned warzone, and you get the same handful of units over and over, which might not matter for AIs, but for myself I prefer a diverse choice in my vehicles and other wartime equipment. Sure, it's modable, but so was ARMA II, and I already know the cool mods for that, which totally redefine the feel of the game.  So, over all:  +Better lighting and physics  +Better voices and immersion  +Diverse factions  +Newer tech to toy around with   -Low diversity of units  -Poor tutorials for those who want to start at the top  -Modernized EVERYTHING, even when unnecessary (e.g. Hummingbirds. It's such a pointles change, just give me my Little Bird!!)  -Virtually no DLCs that expand the battle experience, and the ones that exist aren't worth the cost for the amount of units recieved  -Essentially a more stabil version of a modded ARMA II client   Overall, I would just reccomend saving the money for other stuff, there's plenty of games on steam, but none of them, not even ARMA 3, can match the charm and pure flexibility of ARMA II.
1049	1	a	Shot my friend in the back of the head and parachuted out of the helicopter he was flying as it crashed.  11/10
1051	1	a	If you liked to play soldier in the woods when you were a child with no friends and still has a sick perversion for it this might be a game for you, BUT WAIT IT GETS BETTER... with no enemy contact in 4 hours and when you think you have found some enemies on that one hill you see all the time, you get so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ excited you step on a mine and then die a horrible death and you realise 'Those werent enemies on that hill it was just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing posts standing there for no reason!' , Now to the ratings!  If 'LIK OMG U CNT EVEN DO FUKN NOSCOPE 360 FROM 5 KILOMETERS? WHAT FGGOT GEJM IS TIS?' is a 10  and 'This game is a very realistic game, with realistic weapons and tanks' is a 0   I would give this game a: go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself im no reviewer  Would recommend to my worst enemy!
98	0	a	I would have done a refund, if it wasn't for Steam's two week limit. If you want to play this game, your face will frequently be attacked by huge popups, shouting 'You can't touch this, it's a DLC'.
1053	1	a	Edit: Serious Review  This game is currently the best sandbox military simulator  Pros - Amazing graphics - Amazing gameplay - Supports mods, Which is all about this game, Modders does great stuff - Great fun with friends - Constantly being updated  Cons - Desync issues - Lag issues when there's alot of people in one server
1055	1	a	this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nice game !
1057	1	a	I originally bought Arma when it first came onto steam. However back then I only played 1-2 hours of it, and left it in my library to rot. It was not only until a week or two ago when I started to play it fully. I tried out most gamemodes, and I must say, it is a great game. Below is (a long) first match.  I jumped into a King of the Hill match, and it was hectic. People were shouting over coms, team and proximity chat, strategitcal locations and manuevers. The objective was 3 Km away so everyone at the base was finding transport anyway they could. I found this small helicopter almost full taking off, I hopped in and we flew away.  The pilot, attempting to avoid fire and a long flight, flew over the deep ocean. Now we weren't that far from shore, but far enought that it would be an insanely long swim. I was sitting in the middle of the helicopter looking at the pilot, as he looked back and told me it would only be a couple minutes, and that we would have to parachute. As he looked back at me, I could see through the windshield a missle coming right towards us. There was an enemy hidden on the shore with a rocket launcher. We were hit and falling at a rapid rate. The launcher hit our back tail, and we were plummiting towards the ocean. Fumbling with my keys to try to jump out, the helicopter hit the water, and sank extremely fast. I was lucky enough to eject myself, and swim towards the surface. As I swam I saw several bodies of the other passengers. I was the only survivor.   Hurt from the crash, I was unable to swim fast, and I was stuck in the middle of the ocean. The waves were big so I had to fight staying on the surface. I was about to give up hope and drown myself, as I knew I wouldn't make the swim. All of sudden I hear a helicopter! Some pilot saw the crash and saw me swimming! He lowered himself and I hopped in. Boy was I glad, I thanked him a ton, and we started to fly off as I saw the bodies of my comrades float to the surface. I was able to capture a picture of the rescue below. (I play on three monitors so excuse the extremely wide screenshot)   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=367509437   Sadly this rescue would end soon as the same rocket launcher shot us down for good. I spawned back at base and rode out on an ATV with some random teammate on the back. The drive was long, 3 Km, and towards the end, a helicopter lowered down and shot rockets at us. It had come from nowhere. As it hit us with one rocket, a friendly jet shot it down. Hurt from the rocket, my teammate and I escaped into the bushes. We were still 500 meters from the objective. Moving at an extremely slow rate because of the injuries, we ran into battle. Sadly we were both easily picked off.   My 30 minutes thus far has been a failure to go into actual battle, and I wanted to actually fight for once. I rode on a helicopter and we parachuted down, all 12 of us. People shot up as us as I saw a few friends fall, I flew into a tree and hid in some bushes. An enemy tank and some infantry walked right past me as I lay in the bushes. Once they left, I ran into a broken down house with half of it missing. I look out a window and see a dozen enemy troops parachuting down.. into the backyard. None of them saw me but I knew once I started firing, I was to be outnumbered. Desperate for some firefight, I opened fire. 1..2...3...4... they all fell as I shot them down. More men had landed but they were confused where I was firing from. I had killed 4 men at this point and killed a 5th as I looked to my left to see a sniper in the bushes. Him and I stared at each other for a few seconds, as I saw him aim down his sights, and headshot me.  Seriously 9/10 great game. Only reason not a 10 is because of some bugs and poor optimization on some servers. This game isn't for a casual person looking for some quick action, you should know what you're doing or else people will yell at you.  Too much water -IGN
1059	1	a	I have this game for so long and I really discovered it in these recent weeks .... The mods are so amazing. Especially zombies mods, my favorite. I have a lot of funny moments with my mate. Super game, infinite pleasure! I definitely recommend this game!
1061	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.
1063	1	a	By far the best military sim out there!
1065	1	a	Walking through the countryside, hitching a ride on a helicopter for 10 minutes, and a whole lot of nothing happening all the time. Just like real life, 10/10 would wander pointlessly for 2 hours again.
107	0	a	Waste of money.  I have a 280x and FX-8350 And I get 20 fps in every server but 60fps in single player.  Unplayable garbage, please optimize the ancient engine so I can at least get a pleayable framerate on servers. Stop using 2 of my 8 cores.
1067	1	a	Own a computer with better than the recommended specs   20 fps on medium   10/10 would lie again
111	0	a	Terrible game, developers highly ignored optimizing and fixing bugs in the game. Almost unplayable on multiplayer because of the lack of hit detection, sky rocketing desync, and minimal power usage resulting in less than 20 fps at times. Keep in mind I have a $1200 rig. Now for the good: The concept and basic features of the game are wonderful. If the developers worked out the kinks involved with the networking/performance aspect of the game it would be a five star game. That is the only reason I do not recommend it. Fix the bugs and it's a wonderful game. As of right now it is unplayable.
112	0	a	After years of enjoying the Amra series, im sad to finally change my review to no. At this point the paywall is unreal. The mandatory nature of each ever increasing in price dlc pack makes the game something that cant just be picked up on a short term notice. The original game is nice, the communities and mods out there are great, but the fact that you are now REQUIRED to run apex to do anything other than solo campgian is horrid.  Enjoy the milsim, I'll be playing elsewhere unless the DLC takes a 80+% pricedrop permanantly, as the playerbase continues to shrink from blaoted content packs that destabalize and break the game for those with or without.
113	0	a	No. Just... No.  Arma 3 has a very bad community, a mate of mine said it had good community so i joined and got left by my own squad. I dislike this game also because of the price. cost me $60 USD for a game where i couldnt even play as a civilian on RP. The Graphics are extremely high and i could run them fine with my Nvidia GeForce GXT... and the graphics are beaustiful. Amazing Graphics, HUGE map. Lots of content but definitly something i would NOT recommend.   Shame that the people in Arma 3 ruinned a perfectly good game.  5/10 bad comuntty
114	0	a	Cant get a single match to function. -.-
115	0	a	This is perhaps the most overrated unoptimised peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game i have ever played it doesnt matter how good of a system you have you wont have a stable or good framerat
116	0	a	Went in to the game based on the reviews, the only good part of it is the team capture mode which makes the game sort of like a real life war. Everything else is a waste of your time/life, game is infested with little boys who haven't even hit puberty and will bad mouth you all day, half the servers are terribly laggy and the game is still very buggy. i.e. moving next to a wall and getting ported through, walking through a glass window and getting stuck, etc. etc. Personally I feel the game was a complete waste of my money as there are many other games in this genre that do it much better and are much more worth your time, since more then half the game you will legit spend driving to nowhere land just to get a gun/money only to come back and get hit once and die. I do not recommend this game to anyone as it should be free, because that is all it is worth.
117	0	a	Optimisation? Forget it. My CPU (i7 2600k) and GPU (GTX 780) works at half of their load. 20-40 fps with all the time stuttering is all i got. Changing of settings does not affects on FPS. I'd like to play this. but I can't because of performance.  So, BOHEMIA, we bought Arma 3 Apex DLC, that's for sure. When Arma 3 Optimization DLC coming?  UPD: Got Gigabyte G1 GTX 1070 and another 8Gb RAM (it is 16Gb now)... Same crap fps. So, people who told me to upgrade... Just dont :D
118	0	a	So where do I start!! Review is below please read all before passing judgement :)  I'm so so so disappointed :( I bought a PC again after a massive 8 year PC break when I moved to console in very late 2006 . I bought an Xbox 360 which I owned for almost 6 years then only 13months ago I moved too XBox One had it for 4 months and thought get rid of this piece of junk and use the money I get and put it towards a new Gaming PC so june this year (2014) I bought a PC.    Anyway so I bought a PC with one thing in my mind 'Yes it will be like the old days I will join back up with my clan' I was with almost 7 years ago. I enjoyed countless hours days weeks years with the lads on Operation Flashpoint : Cold War, Arma and then Arma 2. I was in the AirCorps for them 'GOL' clan they are called so I signed up for them cause I forgot my password (come on its been 7 years ago) and used the same name as I was back in 2006 ish 'GOL Tactical' I thought wow its been that long I was wiped from there system :) Anyway LT Chris didnt know how I was so I mentioned a few names to him and that were old clan memebers and he stopped talking for a split second 'are its you Bloody knife' (which was my original name before changing to GOL Clan when I )was expected) The guy that made me start an AirCorps. I was so excited to be back sadly most of the old memebers werent around (god I sound like a child Im' 25).   Sorry for all the text above :) I just wanted you/people to know that I've played Arma before for alot longer than most 7 years straight. I bet most reading this didnt know about Operation Flashpoint was originally part of the same team that is today currently making Amra still today.    Anyway present day 30/12/2014  The Review  I'm sorry but the Arma I grew up to love is just not the same Arma! Arma 3 is like to me the Call Of Duty of today every childs dream, its the game that they must have otherwise your not cool etc although that last statment isn't true for Arma franchise it only came extemely popular in like 2007 to early 2008.   Thats how much I love or sould I say loved Arma it was my goto game whenever I was bored I would talk about Arma when I was at school when I was with anyone, as soon as I got in Lets play Arma whenever I had spare time Lets Play Arma I even bunked/skipped days of school to play more. I just didnt get bored of Arma or Arma 2 or Operation Flashpoint Cold Assault if I'm honest it consumed all of my early teens and into my late teens. Yes a full 7 years of my life  I was coming up to be 19 and on my birthday I bought a Xboxb 360, go and read the above for a full discription :)  So the Arma I knew was a realistic military simulator the best simulator infact but Arma 3 what have you done you've gone slightly futurisitc. Why? Its a military sim how can you simulate something that isnt even made yet keep it with the real life stuff that is used today you at least in my eyes have ruined my childhood game thanks Bohemia Interactive and 555 games thanks a bunch.    It isnt all bad though its just because of my history with the game as you can tell they are many happy customers giving good reviews. But if Arma 1 and 2 and 2.5 is anything to go by hopefully they are modders out there that feel the same way as me and remove all the futuristic stuff and replace with Real Equipment Weapons etc that are used today  If you got this far thanks for reading and dont base the game of my review its just because of my history with the game. The core components are there with what I can assume is realistic simulation its just not me furturisitc stuff in a Simulator you cant call it a sim in my eyes anyway. So as you can tell I dont recommend this game. Even the it almost hurts to say it : (
119	0	a	Amazing game but terrible at the same time i played a good 210hrs of the game just to get on the next day and see i was banned i tried contacting them and they did nothing but i researched it and i dont have it the worst people have played for 5hrs and been banned for nothing dont recommend this game at all.
120	0	a	This could have been a great game, the problem is the developers of the engine are stuck in the 1990Â´s and made an engine that dont take advantage of your GPU. With an i7 2600 and GTX 780 i have between 20-30 FPS, and i have that on absolutely maxed out settings as well as the lowest possible. There is only one reason to even consider this game, and its for the great mod community. But overall, this company does not deserve any of your money.
1069	1	a	its cool if u like anal with no lube
122	0	a	Optimized as a potato.
1071	1	a	This is one of those games you get because of the mods. The core game is nice, but the mods is what really makes it. Battle Royale, Arma 3 DayZ, Altis Life RPG, and many more things to do with this masterpiece military simulator. It's a big step up from Arma 2, however Arma 2 (inc. Operation Arrowhead) have a few more things this doesn't have (like Island Life). Great game overall.
1073	1	a	this game is fun i have had loads of fun theres plenty of game modes and mods so engoy your self 10/10 would play it again
1075	1	a	Really good game, but a little buggy at times.
1077	1	a	I love it :)
1079	1	a	Arma 3 = Awesomeness
1081	1	a	This a very fun and never boring game!
1083	1	a	I started the game up and when I got onto the main menu, I crashed. 10/10 GOTY
1085	1	a	Great Game
1087	1	a	Best ArmA so far es[ecialy physics of the vehicles, as well as its amazing graphics!
1089	1	a	Excellent game plenty of multiplayer options to suit all styles of play although for full enjoyment i would reccomend playing with froends
1091	1	a	1/10 best game of the year - IGN
1093	1	a	Great game, its very fun but it would be best to play with a mic (multiplayer). They also have some great mods
1095	1	a	Arma 3 is a game that everyone needs to try because once you try it you never go back :P
1097	1	a	Get it noobs! Also - SuMatra Wastelands - US # 2 . Come get owned.
1099	1	a	Amazingly fun game, takes a bit of getting used to but once you've got it its golden. I recommend this game to everyone.
1101	1	a	Arma 3 is a war simulator but gets used for a lot of other reasons example, wasteland altis life etc but there are a few problems with it as it still just been released example the FPS on servers are very bad and i know its not my computer as many other people has complained about it but overall it is worth the $60
1103	1	a	Arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. Where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. You will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. The game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like Arma 2 for example. Personally I used to be big on the Battlefield series but once I started playing Arma it was Arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter.   The depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. Everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. Oh and if You don't want to use the vanilla stuff, again there's mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one.   There's also a really fun multiplayer mode called Zues, which is essentially Dungeons and Dragons meets first person modern day shooter. One player acts like the 'DM' and the others play in his / her world. Allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly.   This one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. For information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK6rsWMIvyI   
1105	1	a	Just... Amazing. I see a lot of fun ahead. Still a noob and it is just great. AMAZING community. Found a great guy on a server and he spent over an hour just showing me how to play.   Why are you even reading this, just buy it.
1107	1	a	I hate the DLC system. You buy a game and can only enjoy a part of the content. I pay money for a complete game not for parts of a game.  Almost wish that pirating will be popular again, so game developers need to deliver great stuff to get the buyers back.  With that said, it's still a good game, but it could have been great!
1109	1	a	For ALL of the mods you get when you buy the game from Epoch to Breaking Point to Battle Royale &amp; Wasteland, this game is one of the best that Steam can offer.   Easily worth $60 but sometimes you can find it on sale.
1111	1	a	ArmA 3 Altis Life RPG-  Bought an illegal weapon worth $1,000,000 from a corrupt cop for $150,000, but was arrested by his friend! #WOULDBUYGUNFROMCORRUPTCOPAGAIN!  8/8 m8 - IGN
1113	1	a	did i mention its a must-buy?
1115	1	a	A great start into a new age of tactical gameplay.
1117	1	a	bought this game 1 year ago afther i build my own game pc one of the best games i have ever purchased  there are so many diffrent mods you can have fun in like the all new overpoch from arma 2 now in arma 3 :D  wasteland,battleroyale and all the hours of playing altis life and being a good civi or a cold blooded criminal  the wrokshop is a good place to find some awesome singleplayer mission or co-op missions to do with your friends  still love this game afther 1 year 10/10
1119	1	a	As of late i find this game to be alot more entertaining that the current dayz. although the dayz graphics are better in some ways this just has so much more to do other than run......forever.
1121	1	a	Love the ARMA franchise and will continue to support it, very good multiplayer games for all those who enjoy team work.
1123	1	a	This is what PCmasterrace is all about endless mods and maps the MP content you can create on your own is endless, 10/10 would ARMA all day
1125	1	a	get the game on sale.
1127	1	a	This game is great, coming off from playing a lot of arma 2 this was a great change in this franchise. You can make this game whatever you would like it to be. Always wanted to be a hard-core cop killing drug dealer? You got it! It is a great well made game. r8 8/8 m8 gr8 f8s &amp; b8s
1129	1	a	Much good game, very fun role play servers and some good coop servers. you can drive tanks and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and even fly jets. Quite realistic.  Try to avoid any |GITS| owned servers as they are the most biased and power abusing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the whole of the game. Their servers are very not good.   420/10 - IGN
1131	1	a	I recommend this game because it is a great simulator and has some great mods like arma life and epoch. This game is as close to real life as you will get
1133	1	a	This is a very fun game with stunning graphics and amazing amount of detail. This game looks breathtaking and have so much multiplayer cappabilty. However the content included with the game at this stage (July 2015) is very limiting when comparing to previos ArmA games such as ArmA 2 and ArmA Opeation Arrowhead. However what orginal content this game lacks is made up for in the extensive amount of mods this game holds. There is everything to suit your needs to zombies, base building (if you liked Dayz Epoch) and then relism mods and there there are RP mods. This game is great and keeps getting getter. I would recomend the DLC espically if you intend on playing mods as they will give you a great advantage.
1135	1	a	Sexy game 
1137	1	a	Great game I love Arma 3 life 
1139	1	a	Is this DayZ?
1141	1	a	0/10 mechanics  10/10 fun
1143	1	a	Totally worth the 45 euros. Its an incredible game with or without friends..You can have so much fun and never get bored...You could choose any mod and altis life is AMAZING. The bad thing is the performance from the servers...They are really bad. You cant play with 60 fps...Doesnt matter what setup you have. Anyways, i think its still pretty good...Buy it!
1145	1	a	One of the best games i know!
1147	1	a	Have had a blast playing Epoch, Breaking Point and most recently Wasteland. 1000 hrs and still going. Can't get enough of it.
1149	1	a	Great
1151	1	a	I Love this game its good graphics and addicting
1153	1	a	one of the best games out there
1155	1	a	Very Enjoyable game, with a HUGE variety of games, mods, players, and etc. None the less, the game is entertaing and itll suit about any player if they find their 'community'  Greatest Game I've Played Yet.
1157	1	a	Love it
1159	1	a	Great game for some tactical gaming.
1161	1	a	I have almost 1,400 hours as of this writing. I started from day one of alpha. This is the closest thing to a true sandbox with features of a proper FPS and a 'lite' flight sim. It's a war in a box.
1163	1	a	There's A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of Tanks,choppers,submarines,Cool realism But none of them reach the enjoyfull sport of killing them rabbits in a tank Using a thermal Cannon   13/25-12 Would Kill rabbits again
1165	1	a	Amazing Game, then I found Breaking Point and was blown away even more... worth the buy!
1167	1	a	ArmA is military simulation with military venicles,helicopters,... and weapons.ArmA III is good simulation,but body armor is garbage.In ArmA II you kill everything (without tanks,choppers,...) with one bullet.In ArmA III you kill a soldier with cca 2-5 bullets to torso,to helmed is cca 2-3 bullets and to face is cca 1-2 if you if you aim well.But in ArmA III is the greatest island of the ArmA series.Altis A.K.A Lemnos is large with much cities and villages.Stratis (i dont know how this island was called in real live) is the second island with cca 2-3 towns and 1 city called Agia Maria i think.I play this game with some addons and i can recommend addon called Speed Of Sounds.This addon adds to the game a real sounds of weapons recorded from the firing range.ArmA III includes mission editor where can you create your own mission or campaign and awesome multiplayer.The venicles is good,but in most cases the venicle is remake of the for example NATO AR-2 Darter (quadrotor) is remake for the all fractions (NATO,CSAT,AAF) without FIA.In year cca 2035 is a invasion of Hecler and Koch machineguns and grenade launchers.The joke is in the infantry weapons.I dont see any infantry weapons from Hecler and Koch without addons.Lets go to final verdict...This game is fun but the body armor must die.Venicles and technic is good,but its a remake in most cases.BiS dont exploited the potential of year 2035 and nearly vehicle according to the real originals without some features.Mission editor is good and multiplayer is awesome.You can create a mission and you can play it with friends.I give this game 8/10 or 85/100% who want this score.I hope that my review will be helpful when you buy this if you buy this :)
1169	1	a	Game designed for hardcore players, but still really enjoyable and interesting.
1171	1	a	this game has many modified servers making it worth every penny, and even though it has a full inventory of vehicles it is incredibly difficult to stop playing even if you change server it has details you will not find in most games of its kind.  on different servers and on singleplayer mode it is not a walkover, and you are challenged with the full feel and suppression war brings with good graphics quality and huge map enviroments citys and towns to explore.  i feel as this game should win more awards just for the playability alone and incredibly varied choice of things to do in game its quite simply never ending , the maps are very very big. 20km what game makes you travel that distance and your still not quite where you want to be . there is always a little more to see with all the mods that are being done in multiplayer Â£20 this cost me on a pre release alpha .   the best money i have ever spent so much so i bought 4 friends a copy of this game ...... . and ive never done that in 30 years of gaming.  update .... the amount of hours i have put into arma 3 is over 4000 now mainly on one multiplayer server . but having tried many i feel happy with the life servers . ALTIS LIFE at ts @  sealteamsloth.com  the life servers replicate working robberies, bank heists and many both legal and illegal activities . an all round well blanced community helps . but hard to keep trhat way at times with new people just not reading the rules ,copying their watched videos and trolling to no end . hysterical at times   the wasteland is an obvious military style game type with an arsenal of weapons to be found by scavenging around the island then by team blue or red you take the fight to the enemy . or you go solo in greenfor killing anyone in sight . so a more single minded tactical strategy is needed to  survive . one can get weapons by buying them at often with enemy watching gunstores . so an all round awareness is needed to get in and get out alive as its often a sniper haven area .   the sights on your weapon are vital to success at distances exceeding 200 metres or more . and can be found around the islands and gunstores .  the ability to get your soldier to settle before shooting in distance fire is needed to aim accurately. i cannot stress this enough at long range shooting distances.  often a soldier on the slow move is the best at distance and close up contact .   but it is terrain dependant also . the best way to find out your weakness is to play on a public game server .with the weapons of your choice .  one has to just get in the game to get better at it .   map, navigation and compass are vital tools to easily find your destination and objectives .  strategy is needed on most game modes and servers with many choices and decisions to make a quick game experience of different game servers will help you improve your skills . the ARMAÂ£editor, is a a 3d enviroment now with many tactical options and decisions to be made . with arma 3 you can play for a year and still not be anywhere near completion of the game . it is the best money i have personally ever spent on a game .  there are always new mods and options to try new servers with arma 3 . one just has to get into the role and read the rules set by the server where applicable or needed.  many servers have admins watching / playing which helps out a lot with issues and glitches we find as arma 3 progresses to a better experience for us all.    failures . glitchy actions sometimes the occasional lying down to stand glitch can happen . but overall a great experience when using teamspeak which is free to download as a communication aid between you and your team .   there is other in game communications and chat one can use . task force radio being one also.  my first server i ever played on was an american server an experience i cant forget . the bravado and communication skills are needed to communicate in a effective manner so a microphone is needed for quicker communication in your team or group,  even groups can communicate individually and between each other with channel commander and task force radio options .  sound . well you will need to adjust your sound options turning down the music and renaming your soldier in your profile to suit your batallion or group you play with . optional. in profile . some servers have built in ear supression by pressing a few keys together so only chat can be heard. and other sounds reduced . in game view distances are a helpful aid also to aid in viewing enemys so adjust accordingly between playability and safety.  graphical quality ... arma 3 will use whatever you throw at it and you can still not get full view distances unless you use the top graphics cards out there and often in sli or dual configurations . but anything from an NVIDIA 750ti or higher should help more .the Nvidia 970 is best for price today so dual cards will beat a 980 but not on GDDR5 memory as it cancels to 4 gig on the 970. so be warned get a good system with intel 4th generation or above i5 or i7 series cpu, to get the best from arma3 . yes 6th genertion cpu,s will beast this game the 6700k is probably the best option. today .but not needed should you not have it you will still gain by using a high core cpu even on AMD systems one can have a great experience for less money as many gamers do . quad core 4ghz is a fair balance as arma 3 is cpu intensive. on 1 core , but one can change the pc options to perform better should one need to.  a good sound program is vital if you need to survive long on arma 3 , but not absolutely vital to play the game . 5.1 0r 7.1 headsets are a bonus and work just on lesser priced pc,s through the usb or front jack options. razer are an effective way to quickly gain surround sound in game and the higher priced turtle beaches are an option also but if im fussy i would use the Astro A40 or astro A50 to get some real sound quality to the game .  so the learning curve is high when coming from battlefied 3 or 4 or counter strike games . but the footstep function can save you or your team if you have it in close town battles .  a well coordinated team policy is just part of the excellence that arma can provide when engagements are in your sights .  the game updates are just an important part of playing arma so do it often or when they are shown. see you on the game if you have the right stuff. you probably do ,and if you do not .you soon will.
1173	1	a	tight.
1175	1	a	If you liked ARMA 2, then you will enjoiy this as well. I have this solely for Epoch Mod and it is just fantastic. The visuals are stunning, the maps are large and the game play is smooth. I definitley recommend this to anyone who likes large maps with seemingly endless possibilities!
1177	1	a	runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing drove ma car into a slope it's tires popped and than a tank pullerd out of nowhere and killed my squad seems legit.   11/10
1179	1	a	Great game, I like the King of the Hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch.  Only downside is this games horriable engine. The engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. Once you start to add about 20 AI or players the engine starts to use the CPU or Video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. I seen maybe 30% CPU/GPU usage on a 106 player King of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory I can pull well into the 80's with a few players.  Thats my only gripe about this game. If they would fix that then I would have no complaints at all.
1181	1	a	Arma is a fun military simulator plagued by subpar organisation, lacking hardware optimization, and a laggy multiplayer. When things are going well, the game is extremely fun, but more often than not I have had a crash or two for no reason when in the heat of a firefight.
1183	1	a	Many hours of fun and a plethora of gamemodes. Definately buy it if your PC can handle it.
1185	1	a	Very much worth the buy, I can say with over 900 Hours at this point, that the game is so much fun. By far I can say this game is and will always be worth the 60$. There is so much fun to be had with friends, whether it be RP, KotH, or Capture the Island. This goes without saying that the Modding community is phenominal, as well as the Arma 3 community as a whole. If you or a friend would like hours of entertainment, or a place for some serious RP, whether that be tactical or comedical, BUY THIS.
1187	1	a	Excellent, just absolutely excellent game. The possibilites and endless scenarios that you can create yourself just makes this games one of the best games of this genre, and possibly one of the better and more unique games for PC.  Unrivalled in creativity and possibilities, ArmA 3 is a masterpiece added to the genre. Bohemia delivers, yet again.
1189	1	a	Awesome war simulator, if You are tired of unrealistic FPS where You magically appear next to your squad. Arma 3 is for You. Patience is key in this game. The learning curve is somewhat steep. But once You get into a great team it's worth it. Solo content reminds of Operation Flashpoint and is allright. Multiplayer has a lot of MODs so the diversity of the game is pretty vast. Zeus is a gamemaster vs the players and great fun. Coop teamplay tactical is the most challenging to Your patience but also the biggest reward. AI in this game is getting better but not at its full potential, but definately better than many many other titles. The big sandbox is amazing but by default not 100% optimized, be prepared to read forums for tips and tweaks. The '-malloc=system' launch parameter should be default setting. I do recommend this game if You are into teamplay, solo not so much but then again I havn't tried survival servers. PvP has not been my thing in Arma 3 so can't tell if it is good or not.
1191	1	a	Drove a car over chicken wire. Car broke. 10/10 would drive over chicken wire again
1193	1	a	THIS GAME HAS A STEEPER LEARNING CURVE THAN ANY OTHER GAME - I STARTED TO GIT GUD AT THIS GAME @ AROUND 250 HRS -other than that it is a great game and I would never not recommend it!
1195	1	a	This is what the military games should be!!! The best game i ever had. recommended: 10/10    Make Arma not War Respect from Hellas and from my friends!!!    Please i would like to ask you to put the Hellenic Flag in the game i love my country i love this game!!!  We are waiting for more you are the BEST!!!!!
1197	1	a	i can rub my â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the rug like my dog does 10/10 would rub again.
1199	1	a	Games a blast. You will get way more than your moneys worth with this. The DLC's added have all been really well done, excellent content added also. New Stamina system is a HUGE pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ as it feels like you are an obese land whale who can't handle a 5m sprint. Mods are what makes this game that much better, well the community content in general. Lots of people out there make great missions and host fantastic servers all of which can drastically change anyones experience. I personally don't like the near futuristic setting but I like that they tried something new. (10 tonne of mods to change it to how you want it anyway).   Pros:  Community  Mods  Good Devs  Heaps of content  Lots of fun  Visuals are great  3D editor   Cons:  Sometimes ridiculous AI  Can take a bit of fiddling to get it to how you would like it 
1201	1	a	10/10 would get confused with contorls and stop playing for months.
1203	1	a	I don't own this game but it lets me review it.
1205	1	a	It's fine for a couple of hours.
1207	1	a	Even Stephen Hawking runs better than this game.
1209	1	a	very good game blis buy
1211	1	a	So worth getting, Currently creating a mod called 'Australia Life' with the help of Tonic and Aussie.  Great game for any mode.
1213	1	a	i can craw around on the dirt and pretend to be a worm greatest game i've ever played
1215	1	a	Best shooter I've ever played.
1217	1	a	01001001 00100000 01101111 01101110 01101100 01111001 00100000 01100010 01101111 01110101 01100111 01101000 01110100 00100000 01101001 01110100 00100000 01100110 01101111 01110010 00100000 01000001 01101100 01110100 01101001 01110011 00100000 01101100 01101001 01100110 01100101 00101110 00100000 01010011 01101111 00100000 01001001 00100000 01100111 01101001 01110110 01100101 00100000 01000001 01101100 01110100 01101001 01110011 00100000 01001100 01101001 01100110 01100101 00100000 01100001 00100000 00110001 00110000 00101111 00110001 00110000 00101110
1219	1	a	I only have 2 arms wtf
1221	1	a	Pretty good I guess, Alistair rates 10/8 for realism
1223	1	a	I think that this is absolutly the best game in the world. It offers you the best war simulation (bullets balistic, limited ammo, the inventory system...) with hundreds of weapon and vehicles. It has many game mode which can also been created by the players and even the campaign (followed by secondary missions, the 'demonstrations') is very nice and has a interesting story. Because all of these things I've reached more than 1500 hours, i definitly recommend this game to everyone!
1225	1	a	I played it a little. It was okay.
1227	1	a	i bought the game 2 days ago played it 24/7 but then today I clicked on the app and it showed that box 'preparing to launch arma' but then it dissapered and the launcher wouldnt come up please help
1229	1	a	You can Play dead in this game
1231	1	a	Arma 3 has pretty much anything you're looking for... Tactical shooter experiences as Operation Flashpoint, Arma 1 and 2 did before it.  Fast-paced arena combat like one would find in Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma 3 massively improved the handling of the player characters and makes faster CQC combat much more fluid. The addition of Zeus mode makes many, many styles of missions possible.  Vehicles, whilst nowhere near perfect are brilliant and can be used for whatever uses, be it combat, races or any number of minigame type missions.  This isn't even starting from the thousands of custom missions and hundreds of mods.
1233	1	a	i frickin' love this game &lt;3 if you haven't bought this game yet... shame. I RECOMMEND YOU PICK IT UP ON SALE.
1235	1	a	i want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ karel moricky he has a very sexy voice dlc sucks though
1237	1	a	Love this game. Love it how it is set and everything!
1239	1	a	A completely realistic depiction of real world combat in the near future. Hurhur. As with any BI title, ArmA 3 is a slow burn game that the community will collectively fix and improve far beyond the scope of the original release. If you're at all into warfare simulation and kinda-realism, this is the apex of the genre for the foreseeable future.
1241	1	a	This Game is just bout the most amazing thing I've ever played, and the Zeus DLC adds on tens of thousands of hours of gameplay onto the already huge playability factor... Some glitches, lots are pretty funny to witness in a subtle way... And the Modding community is crazily active. I would buy this again if I had to, steep price, but it is entirely worth what you pay. This game coming from people who have had contracts with different governments to make accurate virtual battle enviroments for training.  ---GET IT---
1243	1	a	YES, ARMA 3 is a tough game to get into. Being such an open world combat emulator it is by definition quite complex. In the number of keys used, options and gameplay variation.  Since the addition of the tutorials and 'Bootcamp' missions, learning how to play has become much easier with step by step instructions to build up experience and confidence with the various controls and options.  For those willing to spend some time learning how it all works, they will be rewarded with countless hours of interesting and varied gameplay.  If you are interested in first person battles with vehicles, aircraft, watercraft and loads of weapons, then its well worth looking into.  If its good enough for the US, Canadian, UK, Australian and Newzealand armies to train with then its good enough for you... (See 'VBS3', military version of ARMA)
1245	1	a	Only played a couple of minutes but it seems pretty good so far
1247	1	a	This is the most intense game I have ever played... The combat is so realistic however, desync really ruin some of the longer range shooting in this game... None the less this is by far the best game I have ever played... If you are looking for tactical realism this is it... P.S: stay away from the trolls
1249	1	a	Buys game and 5 days later it is 50% Sale. 10/10
1251	1	a	Great game, however the APEX dlc is WAAAAAAY TOO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PRICEY. $.$
1253	1	a	If you want an arcade game, get COD.  If you want a war game, get BF4  If you want to feel like you're there, get ARMA 3
1255	1	a	So me and my friend were in a server messing about with heli's and my friend landed next to an enemy squeaker, i snioped the little sh*t and then we healed him and made him drop everything.... as soon as we had all his stuff we took him to a field and made him lay down until we had taken off in the heli, so we went into the heli and was going to fly past telling him he can go now thats when i decided to blow him up with the heli guns. we got half way across the map and felt bad so we said we will meet him back at the airport and pick him up... he was waiting there in a tank and blew us out of the sky.  10/10 would be an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to a sqeuaker again
1257	1	a	27fps nvidia gtx970 would buy if i wasnt poor
1259	1	a	Immerse, massive community, mods for everything and just good fun all round. Something for everyone's taste.
1261	1	a	Sick game 10/10 would bang
1263	1	a	It's alright
1265	1	a	Been playing this game with pirated cracked version with several people for a long time while saving money for this. My game time should be over 1000 hours since the first time I tried Arma 3. In short, this game is so amazing, even though there's bug here and there. Most of the contents are player made, so this game will be played for a long...long time I say... No regrets buying it on steam, especially on steam sale hahaha!!  TL:DR = BUY THIS GAME, SUPPORT THE DEV. ONE OF THE BEST GAME/MILITARY SIMULATION EVER...
1267	1	a	Arma 3 is based on real events playing in 2016 few days after UK has left the EU.
1269	1	a	- Spawn in - Chat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ get robbed - Get ran over in Kavala Square - Chat more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - Get arrested - Swear at police and get put on youtube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwJrAWl8Ec  - 20 minutes in jail - Repeat  10/10 Would do again Ù†Ø§Ù‚Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø¬ÙˆÙ„Ø© Ù‚Ø¯ Ù…Ø§Øª
1271	1	a	its just that good.
1273	1	a	Very good game, Fun to play with mate especially on life servers definetly recommend this game.
1275	1	a	Very Ploxy And MLG en mi opinion.
1277	1	a	I think you know my opinions on this game.
1279	1	a	Good game, lots of mods.  35Â£ for 3,1k hours of fun, sounds fair to me.
1281	1	a	I don't even have this game, why can I write a review for it?
1283	1	a	'rifleman 600 meters'      where?
1285	1	a	Best milsim game on interwebz I love playing king of the hill killing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es in my wipeout. 11/10
1287	1	a	it's worth the $60  it's not worth the trip to the hospital after i clipped through the ground for the 86th time
1289	1	a	1. Look at me hours mate. 2. Milsim. 3. Wasteland. 4. MODS. &lt;3 Arma 3
1291	1	a	800 hours, still crashing cars C:
1293	1	a	Just buy this game + DLC pack. It's all you'll need for the rest of your natural life! And before you even get started, know that you'll need to learn all the bugs, as they are features of the game. But seriously, if you like shooting things, and realism appeals to you over arcadism, and especially if you like scripting, making objects or other game content, this game is so versetaile that it should keep you busy for a long time.
1295	1	a	Gr8 game. Don't actually own the game but I can review it.
1297	1	a	Nothing on Earth can run this game. What I can do, however, is enjoyable.
1299	1	a	Fantastic game! Plenty of action and 'moments' - even better if you're playing with friends!  However, if you're a hardcore Call of Duty fan who enjoys fast paced first person shooters - highly not recommended. But if you're looking for a different challenge, then definitely worth a shot!
1301	1	a	Arma 3 has something that I don't. That something is tranquility.  Loose your gear? I Loose my sh*t.
1303	1	a	That Game is a lot of fun with a lot of game modes. My favorite is BattleRoyale. 
1305	1	a	Really amazing game i play it almost everyday the campaign is amazing also plus the fact that you can get mods to is another amazing thing like Arma 3 Life is what i play really its just a amazing. fun, gane that everyone chould get ive played for a LONG time and i still love this give 10/10
1307	1	a	Shot a guy from 600m with a Katiba with a RCO scope 10/10 IGN for fun.
1309	1	a	Great game its a must have
1311	1	a	Great game
1313	1	a	Worst game ever.                    Just kidding, it's actually the ULTIMATE military simulator.
1315	1	a	Very good game with endless possibilities as well as mods but lacks good optimization. You'll need a very good CPU as well as GPU to run this game on ultra with a stable 60 fps. Extended support for the next year for this game as well.
1317	1	a	The best fps drop simulator.
1319	1	a	Arma3 is where its at! I've been playing Arma since 2009 and I love it!
1321	1	a	If you enjoy arcadey games like Call of Duty or Battlefield then this game might not be for you. However, if you enjoy a realistic aspect to an FPS game and want to meet other like minded people then this game is right for you. 10/10 would recommend.
1323	1	a	It's like skyrim, with horrible controls!
1325	1	a	-Second time writing review!- Best Military Shooter game i'v ever played! Pros -Realistic physics -Beautifull graphics -Good Optimization (after 1.60 update)  Cons -Playing in servers,fps drops  ---Wasteland--- So here i am with my cousin,next to city named ''Kavala''. We started to run towards the city to get some better gear,and hope to not see anybody. When we we're in city,we heard tank coming towards us,so we ran away and got lost,i didn't know where my cousin was,but one thin i knew,that he was somewhere in the city. I found an MK rifle and found RPG rocket,but not an actual RPG,so i didn't take it. Then i heard gun shots,so i started to run where sound led me,thinking that its maybe my cousin,when i was close to gun shots,i started to hear Tank engine sound,so i crouched and aprouched area. Saw tank was shooting at house with machine gun,so i aimed at guy who was shooting,and shot him in head. Tank wasn't moving so i realized thats an AI,so i aprouched tank from behind and set three mines that i found and ran away,then started to shoot at tank so it drives backwards to my location,and it did. Tank exploded but i didn't know,what they we're shooting at,i cerafully went in that house and saw my cousin.  --Exile--  So i spawned,and got killed by zombie horde.  -------------------------------- Sorry for my english! :P  well.....yeeeahhh.....buy it.. actually...eh
1327	1	a	This ain't CoD
1329	1	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good cant stop playing thank you so much people who created this i hope everyone else likes it as much as i do  
1331	1	a	i shot a fish in the face 
1333	1	a	Very good game  Pros: -Loads of user made missions / content -Loads of servers -Possibility of making your own server -Good graphics  Cons: -Not very optimized -Loads of trolls / hackers around the community -Servers are bad at FPS. You lose a lot of frames  Overall it is a good game but more can be done for the optimization
1335	1	a	Wow I've played 500+ hours on this game and I'm still not bored of it. The game throws you into the battlefield with no help at all, in fact it can be a little confusing at your first minutes of play. But once you dedicate yourself and learn the Art of War, you will soon be talking, what almost seems alien language, to others in your house.  From your usual mainstream happy-go-lucky Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma 3 teaches you the realism of war by simulating... WAR. It will be frustrating, it will be dirty and it will rewarding!   You can either get into multiplayer (strategic and friendly for the best part), single player (which has a good campaign at the same time introducing you to what you will be heading into for the rest of the game) and editor (a huge sandbox where you can do anything and make anything such as missions, mods, and just mess around to get used to the gameplay and physics).  Absolutely love this game and totally recommend it for veterans and people who are interested in the whole military theme.
1337	1	a	Terrible Optimisation Desync in every corner of the map Clunky Stance system Vehicles exploding when driving into a fence How did that guy just kill me Why did I just change to walking mode No I didn't just lower my weapon It that a rock on the hill? *BANG* Kids on every single Altis Life server Flying MRAPS everywhere The Admin is now a Goat or random animal  The best Combined arms Milsim game ever made
1339	1	a	The amount of Community mods available really makes this a worthwile purchase.  There are so many different game mods and modes, it's like purchasing 10 different games. 
1341	1	a	Best milsim actually.
1343	1	a	I've never tried the previous ARMA games before ARMA 3, and i've never played anything like ARMA. Its a hardcore military sim that honestly is'nt for everyone. But playing this games, there are many spectacular moments that no other game can compare. The sheer strategy and timing required in a well planned mission is intriguing. The bility to edit maps and create custom missions along with steam workshop integration makes the experience more enjoyable.
1345	1	a	 Some things in Arma change:   -Customizable weapons -Customizable gear -No more helicopter MFD's -SCUBA diving -Everything has FLIR -Bigger maps -Lots of vehicles -Lots of guns (that kinda suck...)   Some things in Arma never change:   -Sloppy mechanics -Buggy... -That mouse wheel menu... -Hiking -Wandering -Walking around aimlessly -3 factions -Server lag (sadly even with low ping sometimes)   Verdict:   -Buy this game 
1347	1	a	What an awesome game !
1349	1	a	This is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. I had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. I don't think Dark Souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress.  One annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage German porn flick, i guess NATO must have lowered the standards in 2035. He'll start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   But don't let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. It takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it.   The graphics is good, but you need a very powerful PC to play it with high settings. The FPS is showing when you do the changes so you don't have to exit the menu to test it.  A joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters. The game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles.  The ballistics add a touch of realism.
1351	1	a	Arma 3 enhances on the Arma 2 experience by running better and expanding on features to make it a lot more of a smooth experience. With Arma 2 movement was clunky and sometimes that could have gotten you killed in a firefight because you couldn't get in cover because of the really bad control scheme, however with Arma 3 that is fixed with the stances system. The vehicles of Arma 3 are a lot better than Arma 2, it works. I can't wait until mods like ACE are released on Arma 3 expanding on the experience even more. It's well worth the price.   Although the content is slightly lacking, the game expands on Arma 2 loads and I'm sure an expansion pack like Operation Arrowhead will appear for Arma 3 aswell.  Buy it, well worth it.
1353	1	a	its the best
1355	1	a	the controls are still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. Didnt you learn anything from previous Armas
1357	1	a	If you are looking for a proper Army/War Sim this is what you need. Forget Battlefield, COD and all the rest. Arma III is a sandbox true as you will find sim. Not only that the modding community are 2nd to none, adding tones of extra content.
1359	1	a	This is the definitive shooter. Forget Call of Duty, forget Battlefield, this is leagues beyond those titles. From fighting as a lone wolf to supporting a team of seventy-two other players on land, above or below seas, and in the sky, everything feels just as it should, just as it would be if it were real. For those that love beutiful visuals, sharp skill curves, and of course, Bohemia's trademark realism, this title cannot be missed.
1361	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AMAZING! Everybody should own this xD
1363	1	a	what a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game xD
1365	1	a	Great game, Highly recommend
1367	1	a	Awesome way better then arma 2 has Greatly improved should definitley pick up some time
1369	1	a	Arma 3 is hands down one of the best war simulator/games that I have ever played!!! If you just want to run and gun then this game is not for you, maybe COD or Battlefield is something more suited for you, but if you are looking for a full immersion into what war is really like, then Arma 3 is the game that you want.. or the game that you need!! Arma 3 has hundreds upon hundreds of different mods and scenarios that you can play so that you are never bored. With mods like Battle Royale, Breaking Point(DayZ) and King of The Hill you will find yourself playing for hours upon hours!!
1371	1	a	This game is badass
1373	1	a	Inconsistent performance, but you soon forget about that when you realise the scale of battles and just how in-depth a game it is. Amazing.
1375	1	a	Love This Game
1377	1	a	Good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, better than Arma 2, but not enough weapons or vehicles.
1379	1	a	This game is very well done. It is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game. This is also somewhat a downside though. It makes missions being done by yourself without any AI or player assistance very difficult. But if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions, you will enjoy this game. The multiplayer is awesome. Before I found this game, I had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point. The workshop feature makes the game even better, being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have. This is overall a pretty cool game.
1381	1	a	If I could give this game 5 stars... I wouldn't... But 4.5 without question, this game is a tonne of fun if your looking for something way more realistic than battlefeild! Best served with a squad and a large helping of patience...  Also expect many random deaths due to walls and stuff
1383	1	a	+ wide military realism gameplay experience + great graphics + moddable contets and huge community  - currently issues with slow servers(some lagging = low FPS just like in A2) - big HW requirements
1385	1	a	Buy it, learn it, enjoy it! Be sure to play WITH others as this game is not meant to be played 'solo'. Although ArmA3's single player campaign (the first two chapters) is amazing, thrilling and just plain crazy the game itself is meant to be played with others!
1387	1	a	One of the best games ive played in a long time graphics are great if on ultra low graphics are still good and game controls and movement is fluent!
1389	1	a	Arma 3 is immersive: as one of the best (if not THE best) military simulators on the market, A3 surrounds you in a variety of breath-taking environments and puts you in the center of the action. You'll receive radio transmissions through bursts of static, hear the wind go by, feel the ground shake when a tank rolls by. Everything from the weather and lighting down to the recoil of the gun in your hand is so finely tuned and detailed, that the only closer you could get to realism is to enlist.   Arma 3 is dynamic: it has an arsenal of mods just waiting to alter the game a little more one way or another. With a community thriving on creating more and more for the game, the sky is the limit for what can be done. No two missions will ever be repeated the same way. AI learn and adapt to situations, forcing you to do the same or die, and with a fully destructible environment, nowhere is safe until the enemy are all dead.   Arma 3 is intense: you'll know this when you hear the bullets snap past your head and you're holding your dead teammate in your arms. The smallest firefights can shift the course of an entire battle. Life or death can be determined just from which way you decide to lean. Teamwork is tantamount to success, and unlike many modern shooters, there are no 'lone wolf heroes', no one guy rushing the enemy line and winning the game for everyone. You work together or you die. There is no third option.   Arma 3 is the game you want when nothing but the best will do.
1391	1	a	This game has to be the best immersive game you can ever get makes you feel like its real life.
1393	1	a	This game is amazing! Definitely one of the best FPS games i've played. If you ever thought Battlefield was realistic, this game is the definition of what a realistic first person shooter should be. Apart from its low FPS count (as experienced by many players all over the world), this game stands out in every other aspect. If you're looking for a realistic military simulator with an amazing community, look no further! You've found it :D
1395	1	a	Drove an Atv while laying down, only super elite combat units can do this. 10/10 its like skyrim but with guns. - ign
1397	1	a	You really need to play this to realise what a skillbased shooter is all about. And it's fun to boot!
1399	1	a	since the mod-community is starting to warm up on this game, i recommend it to every MIL-SIM gamer/lover!
1401	1	a	Great Game
1403	1	a	How to fully enjoy ARMA III In my oppinion:  1. Get a launcher to run it with (ArmaIIISync is great). That way you can tweak the performance so it runs properly, and it makes it easier to run mods. 2. Find a good clan to play with. I can heartily recommend the VDV-GRU if you like serious Mil-Sim experiences in a friendly enviroment, no matter your starting skill level. Be advised: we use a lot of mods, and we play as Russians, so be prepared for a lot of AK's and shooting at NATO-friendly forces. 3. Get some good mods to shape your arma Experience the way you like.  Have fun!  Sincerely, Efreitor Hansen , Bravo LMG, 1. Squad, C-Company, 45th Light Recon Detacthment of the VDV (Russian airborne) (Arma titles, not real life)
1405	1	a	Realistic Battlefield Simulation!
1407	1	a	You like realistic military games? Than this game is for you! Arma series has impressed me yet again. STeam workshop for this game pretty much adds a brand new game to arma 3. I use to play the deathmatch for arma or the coop for arma but now i find myself playing stratis life which is a life simulator. game gets updated a lot and adds new stuff every month. game is worth every penny  Pros open world military game everything is driveable small caves firefights are intense  Cons Dlc are overpriced buggy 
1409	1	a	I love this game its very fun and alot like a simulation.It does take some time getting used too the controls but after you can have a blast playing it.
1411	1	a	THIS IS A GOOD WAR SIM
1413	1	a	 I've been looking for a good tactical shooter since Ghost Recon series (the old ones), since the last Advanced Warfigther (PC version, not the console one which is completely different), with slow paced and realistic combat style. For a reason I missed ArmA series, this is my first ArmA game, which meets my expectations in different ways, but, it is not perfect. It is being labeled as a Simulator, but still it is a videogame with so many arcade functions and glitches. Cons at the bottom.
1415	1	a	It figures that I finally buy this game and then it goes on sale. Still, not unhappy with my purchase.
1417	1	a	One of the best mil-sim ever produced. It offers a great variety of units, vehicles, weapons and environmental diversity. The best part, still the modding community and the Arma III Editor, literally endless. You can create at will, modify, script it, doesn't matter, if you want, YOU CAN DO IT. Ballistics and Physics have improved astonishingly, the animations are fluid and you can feel it's verisimilitude. If you're a seasoned ArmA veteran, you'll definitely love this game, you'll find everything you already know and a whole new scale of possibilities and AWESOMENESS. If you're new to the ArmA Series, you, like everyone else, will go through a very steep learning curve, you'll find yourself having troubles running, walking, aiming, shooting, driving, flying, planning and pretty much any activity you're about to perform. but don't give up just yet, I can assure you, if you're a fan of mil-sim, you'll love it and it'll come to life. The game is pretty much awesome, but it'll really come to life once you find a couple of friends to play with! Good Luck! See you in Altis!
1419	1	a	Great game overall ! Try it out if you haven't yet !
1421	1	a	If you're looking to implement tactics, this is the game by far. I highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to escape the mundane FPS genre.
1423	1	a	Its a very good game,has a great easy to use editor,good mod supports. the game has a bit of a learning curve but its not that big. over all its a wonderful game
1425	1	a	Great fun game!
1427	1	a	It was fun
1429	1	a	Great game, really gets you addicted, worth the money(check out â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, for cheaper price). Still a bit buggy, and need some tweaks. But nothing major. You'll need a good computer, but with the recent multiplayer updates, im getting better fps at this then ARMA 2.
1431	1	a	Although not impressed with the 'Futuristic' setting (equipmemt wise) ARMA3 is the best choice for those who seek 'the something else'. Mainstream/arcade-ish game-modes from other games are already there for those who wany 'Something easy' while you can also achieve maximum complexity in custom missions with custom community addons. Almost ANY situation/equipment CAN BE created/recreated in ARMA verse -especially with the updated engine/functions.  Of course..it's not a secret IT IS a VERY demanding game on your hardware-but performance optimizations will be more visible by the time. Bohemia Interactive have never let their ARMA fans without support/optimizations/free content in the past. I don't have reasons to believe something will change in the wrong way in the immediate future :)
1433	1	a	So far this has been one of my favorite games.
1435	1	a	The only game I look forward to playing at the end of my day!
1437	1	a	The 400 Hours Says it all, a game good even without the fantastic modding community who constantly add too and evolve the game.
1439	1	a	This game is great it offers a wide variety of things to play and to whether your thing is role play or killing people just because u can. I'd recommend this game to nearly everyone who like fast pace shooter or zombie survival.
1441	1	a	good game fun to play whit friends
1443	1	a	Very interesting choice, I love it, this is my favorite multiplayer game. I play in a Milsim unit and have led them before too. It is best with a group of people; seeing as it is a military simulator this would make sense. I enjoy it very much and my favorite role is to be a pilot. If you are a casual then you can play on vannilla and there are plenty of those. If you are into a little more of a challenge than you may want to go in to Tactical realism or MilSim. It is very fun but can be demanding on your computer, also it has a few glitches and may seem expensive. The choice is up to you. Odds are that you PROBABLY would have already gotten the idea of what the game is like from the preview. This is one of those games where if you are interested you will probably like it, but don't pass it down if you are curious.   -Message me if you are wanting to join a Milsim Unit.   Have fun! Worth the price!
1445	1	a	just tried out this game, seems okey, but IÂ´ve just seen 5% of the game... still a lot to discover
1447	1	a	Got forced intto singing Wrecking Ball and be put on youtube for not paying a fine ingame.   10/10 would sing again  Proof:  http://www.altislife.co.uk/topic/45988-unable-to-pay-fine/   
1449	1	a	I went as Zeus in multiplayer and kep moving the truck when a dude was trying to get in it. Ended up blowing him up with arty's.   I spawned an enemy tank infront of a squad in multiplayer as Zeus.   I struck lightning to the medic reviving someone.   10/10 trolling simulator
1451	1	a	Having served in the military I can say that this game is great for realism and accuracy. This is NOT COD, it actually takes time effort to learn how to hit a target with an assault rifle at 300 meters.  Fatigue actually has an effect on the game, you have to stop and catch your breath if you move too fast for the weight you caring if you want to actually hit anything. The enemy AI is intelligent, they actually get into cover when being shot at, and they have great accuracy when returning fire.  You can move freely in between infantry and mechanised roles, without loading screens. The numbers of each on you team actually have a big effect on the outcome, as well as how they are used, as most vehicles require multiple players to use them effectively, e.g. A tank needs a gunner driver and a commander to be effective.  Arma 3 improves greatly on Arma 2, and with over 300 hours spent between them I can defiantly say this game is worth buying 
1453	1	a	:)
1455	1	a	it's a awesome game it's lot's of fun 
1457	1	a	Arma 3  I would have to say after playing al least 70 hours, that this is an amazing game. If you see this on 30 dollars buy it now. Just be ready for the hard learning curve of gameplay and mods problems. 9/10
1459	1	a	A really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes. However, the game is a little 'unfinished' or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions (combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing). However, overall, the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download.
1461	1	a	Endless fun. Campaign, Editor, Multiplayer, Mods, Total Conversions. If its on sale and you dont buy it, I cant be your friend.
1463	1	a	The best game.
1465	1	a	Very fun if you like RPG and Hunger games. ( Atlis Life RPG, Battle Royale hungergames)
1467	1	a	!!!
1469	1	a	Probably the best game-wise purchase of my life.
1471	1	a	its fun to play if ur into tactical fps
1473	1	a	I've been playing 'Arma' since it was called 'Operation Flashpoint'. I have bought every version, and every addon. In all those years, the only thing that really changed is the graphics. This is both a good thing, and a bad thing.  Arma in its various iterations is first and foremost an infantry combat simulator, the vehicles and aircraft are mostly window dressing. It is not Call of Duty. It is the closest thing to real world infantry combat you can come to without enlisting. The AI, for infantry, is generally very competent in most conditions. Occasionally, their odd, out of character behavior seems very lifelike, even human. I won't go on at length, but at times, they'll behave very realistically.  Unfortunately, the AI is also the game's biggest shortcoming. Vehicle AI have always had the driving competency of a near sighted fifteen year-old Asian girl. They run into and over things/people with alarming regularity especially if they get near buildings.  They will occasionally wig out and glitch in place, or enter a Customer Service Feedback Vindaloop that never ends. I have lost count of the number of times I have executed my own team, which is at least quite therapeutic when the frustration becomes too intense.  It is in many ways a fantastic game, and when it's working right, it is absolutely glorious. When it's not working you'll need to take frequent breaks or risk chucking your PC off your balcony.  It is also still a 32-bit engine, which is horrifying because it is EXACTLY the kind of game that would benefit massively from the additional resources 64-bit would provide. I hope they get around to doing that eventually.    Despite it's flaws, for anyone who is a keyboard commando, a mouse marine, a wannabe soldier, or a real soldier looking to relive his glory days, this is pretty much a must have, and Arma 3 is the best and most beautiful itteration yet. Just make sure you have a bottle of aspirin handy.
1475	1	a	This game... Well, the story is: if you hope for a campaign, it's here, but it is one of the worst i've played - after 5 hours of a 'meh' 1st campaign, comes the second one, where a greek insurgent has a terrible accent... polish, to be exact (no racism against poles, i am one, and our accent does sound awful). But the multiplayer - as addictive as it can get. Good balance when it comes to co-op - it always is a challenge to beat the ai. Though it does obviously have some bugs, sometimes. Pros: - Fresh and new compared to BF and CoD... and in my opinion somehow better than both. - Quite good graphics - A nice choice of weapons in MP... though there could be more - A LOT of creativity from the devs - Finally, a truly team-based FPS - A lot of customisability for your character - though it's not Rainbow Six Vegas 2 level of it. Cons: - The campaign is crap - enemies hitting you from impossible angles, a pretty bad story... though better than CoD:G - Even if you have a beastly PC, there will be a frame rate drop when driving in vehicles if you have you view distance too high (as infantry, i use 8000 m, i have to use 1200 in vehicles) - Bugs bugs bugs... Though the devs patched a lot of them already. Overally, the game is a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 if the campaign was a tad better, and if not for bugs which actually hurt the gameplay (sinking into a pier when trying to climb it) it would be definitely the best FPS on the market. It is the best when it comes to team play and realism though. Definitly recommend.
1477	1	a	i like the game and will play it more often ,., also if u hav friends that play the game its even better
1479	1	a	This is ARMA. This is no joke. The war is no joke.  Sometimes it's broken, sometimes it breaks you legs when you hope over fence, sometimes it lags. But it's still the best damn military game out there.  Either play it SP or MP, it looks wonderful, it sounds wonderful and feels wonderful.  There's nothing like hiding in the bush for 30 minutes to kill someone without them knowing where it came from.  Also gamemodes like altislife, invade the island or wasteland are worth a try. Tons of fun and I mean TONS.    
1481	1	a	11/10
1483	1	a	Excellent game, tactical gameplay. I have been playing ARMA since 2004, each version getting better and better
1485	1	a	best multiplayer experience i ever had. the only problem is the fps.
1487	1	a	So much game for the money. It's more than just another shooter game, there are loads of mods available which increase playability of this game hugely.  From dayz style zombie survival mods to flappy birds style atv flying. Race around Altis in go-karts or try and complete the sky track in a 4x4. Get serious with a sniper mission, or get scared on a horror map trying to find the mothman. Have a second life, rob people, sell drugs and buy a house on Altis life or survive and build your own base on Overpoch. Team up with friends and take over a village from terrorists or become superman and take on an army yourself.  Some of my favourite mods include Overpoch, Altis Life, Wasteland and Battle Royale.  I highly recommend Arma3. You all should get it! Lots of hours worth of gaming here. Entirely worth full price, even better value if you get it in a sale.
1489	1	a	This game gets a bit repetative after a while, but is still fun to play when you got nothing else to do.
1491	1	a	This game is fantastic. Infact it is the most immersive game I have ever played. I realized this when me and some random person I met found each other on a wasteland server and survived by the skin of our teeth, savenging items, raiding towms, and dying a little too many times in the varied and colorful landscape of Altis. This is only just a small part of the game that I happened upon, so believe me when I say that I can't wait to discover the rest of it.
1493	1	a	Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.  The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves.
1495	1	a	Super fun and realistic (in terms of actual warefare and game/vehicle/weapon mechanics) game with a great community, and great community made missions.  That's about all there is to say about the game.
1497	1	a	Arma 3- As real as it gets.
1499	1	a	This is a great military simulator, this game is the closest thing that you get to realism
1501	1	a	This is one of those games that is VERY HARD. (thats what she said). But anywho this game is worth it. No only is it every going to cease to be fun, but it has infinte replayabliaty. Only 1 con is that the weapon sway is hard to get use to. 9/10
1503	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game with a large map and tons of things to do. There are many vehicles and weapons to chose from to destroy your enemy, or random helpless rabbits. There are plenty of mods to keep you satisfied. You can also create your own battles. I would recommend this game to anyone who does not need constant action to have fun.  8/10  Positives +Vehicles +Weapons +Large map +Customization +Mod Support +Freedom  Negatives -A little rough on the FPS -The controls are hard to get used to
1505	1	a	1.Purchase Arma 3  2.Install Breaking Poind Mod 3.Never ever play Dayz Standalone/ Epoch/ Overpoch 4.Uninstall ALL Survival Games  5.Play Breaking Point 6. Enjoy my whole 1,700 hours of breaking point
1507	1	a	10 out of 10. Best of its genre. I highly recommend checking out  Gaming-Asylum.com   }&gt;&lt;{{{*&gt;
1509	1	a	Very good game with a lot of different play scenarios! Love this game
1511	1	a	Logged almost 3100 hours on ARMA 3.... !!! Its incredible. Taken over my life.... Absolutely the best game ever. It is worth the money and the upper-end machine you'll need to fully enjoy it.  Join a clan and enduldge yourself in the awesome multiplayer maps, especially the wastland servers. What are you waiting for? Its the closest thing to real war you'll ever experience.
1513	1	a	The Best Millitary Game Now-Days !!
1515	1	a	This game is really quite good. It wholly deserves the 60 dollar price in my opinion, and that is true to form. There has been a huge amount of work put into the game. Its scale and the seriousness with which it was handled by its developers absolutely deserves them the full 60 dollars. This game puts even next gen games to the test. It is fantastic. I will relay some of my experiences with the game:  Personally I am a HUGE fan of the lighting in the game. The dark is really dark, and the light is really light. The light is in fact just beautiful. There is nothing like driving in the night with your headlights on, and stopping somewhere with the light of your headlights to work by. Or moving through the dark in the morning, with a flashlight and a lighthouse far above you to keep things clear. Even tracers are quite well done, and you will constantly be taken aback by the absolute beauty and accuracy of both the lighting and the environment.  On to the environment. The environment is enormous. Hills, plains, farmland, valleys. It is all very well designed and is covered by very accurate and realistic looking flora which all server the purpose of providing some very useful and much needed cover. The scale of things is just huge, and is enough to blow ones mind. It is really something, standing on a hill 1 km away from an enemy platoon on the face of another and exchanging fire. That is what battle is, and that is really the scale that stands true to the test as what Arma is really about.  The vehicles are also a great part of the game, they are all EXTREMELY meticulously designed, and appear to be very much the real thing. In some ways, different, but you will not mind your long commutes via chopper or land solely because of the eye candy that is your ride.  The gunfire is a bit disappointing, however. Firing ones gun is not as much a pleasure as it may be in other games. It does not convey the same detail or intricate beauty that other parts of the game do, and does not feel nearly so powerful. I am not sure as to why this might be, but the guns are just so... light. I would like to see some more impressively realistic muzzle flare and gun interaction.  Additionally, the AI in the game is very flawed and can certainly leave one disappointed, especially during showcase missions. When I would like to play with a fully interactive AI, I meet soldiers who are completely unresponsive, downright born with autism and having a heart attack, or are just altogether far too quick to respond and accurate, just like a robot. The AI opponents often leave one shaking their head at the huge holes in interactability, especially on missions where otherwise this would be the focus of the game.  In total, however, the game is huge. If you are interested in the sort of fully fledged MILSIM combat that this game has to offer, please get it. I assure you that there is nothing else like this out there, and this is a game of its own. The creators had a mission, and that mission was achieved. Be responsible when you are flying your intricately designed helicopters or blazing tracer rounds at enemy soldiers down the ravine. Its fun stuff, and you never know where that may lead.
1517	1	a	Arma 3 is definatly easily my favorite game of all time, it produced an unforgetable experience, it showed stunning visual gamplay along with a brilliant engine that works very well with the game, It has a massive selection of weapons and vehicles. The community of Arma 3 is amazingly massive, there are tons of gamemodes and servers just waiting to be played on. It comes with a campaign that is entertaining and well developed. It also has a gigantic workshop community with new weapon skins, vehicles and all sorts being added each day. This game is simply fantastic and well worth every penny.   10/10
1519	1	a	Play it and get addicted
1521	1	a	This is one of the best games around on pc. There is so much to do from killing zombies to being a realistic tatical war game. It has brought me and my friends countless memories and is still doing so from running away from cops with 50 pounds of weed in my car to haveing intense shootouts on a wasteland server.  Pros Great game Super fun Open world Huge map lots of people to play with LOTS of gamemodes  Cons NOT OPTIMIZED (gtx 980 with i7 4770k on ultra gets 20-40 fps on multiplayer servers) All rifes sounds the same dlc's like helicopter and marksmen should have already been in the game   Conclusion Its an awesome game with alot of fun things to do but not optimized at all  
1523	1	a	This is PCMASTERRACE at its BEST...  ...and also at its WORST  Accept no substitutes!
1525	1	a	Awesome Game! Like the customizations that you can do to make this game more realistic. Fun to play with freinds! a Must have!
1527	1	a	love the graphics in this game and how real life it is
1529	1	a	Great game to play on spare time i highly recomend Arma3
1531	1	a	Arma 3 launcher has stopped working
1533	1	a	Really Good Game  Enjoy every single Part Of It   Really good mods commountes
1535	1	a	Ok, lets face the facts, this game is quite a bit of money, but it is totaly worth it.
1537	1	a	I havent really played Arma 2 much but i have to dare say that i think Arma 3 is one of the BEST games i have ever played!!! Zeus mode alone is worth it when you have friends to play with. Foget Call of Duty and yes even forget Battlefield, this is the ultimate FPS shooter on pc available.  Although Arma 3 might be a little taxing on lower end machines its worth the buy if you want a solid campaign, insane multiplayer and all round good laughs with your friends!  
1539	1	a	Despite it's flaws, the infantry combat is two steps up above ArmA 2, adding much needed fluidity to once an extremely clunky interface. That coupled with the inclusion of Play withSix granting users an easy way to access the hundreds of user-generated content (a requirement), makes ArmA 3 worth getting at full price.
1541	1	a	This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good
1543	1	a	Great game i don't remember life without it (would add a meme but i might get cancer)
1545	1	a	Amazing graphics, Well up to date compared to other games. Most extreme militray simulater
1547	1	a	Beautiful Game - Comes with a vast modding capacity, but not much stability for mods in terms of platform upgrades when they release. Unfortunately thats life, but hey, the mods update again and its all good to go.
1549	1	a	The newest iteration of the ArmA milsim franchise, ArmA 3 is set in the near future on a set of Mediterranean Islands. The Single Player is by far the best I've seen in an ArmA game and that's only after playing the first part of a three part campaign. The movement and pacing in ArmA 3 is greatly improved in relation to ArmA 2 and the combat and AI are far above it's predecessor.
1551	1	a	If you loved arma 2 you'll LOVE arma 3. AWESOME GAME! Buy it!
1553	1	a	This game is the best fps you could play. But this new update with the new stamina adjustments messed up a lot of things. Still a great game, just needs to be fixed.
1555	1	a	I would recommend this game at full price. Totaly worth it. I barly know anything about the millitary or fps' and I picked it up really quicky. Fun to screw around on Multiplayer and other Gamemodes.
1557	1	a	5/5
1559	1	a	Arma 3 has to be the best game I have ever played. It has one of the best communities possible and the amount of addons for the game is unreal. A must have!
1561	1	a	It is a great game to play. A lot of traveling to do as well and many things to explore within the world.
1563	1	a	I'm not going to say, BUY THIS GAME!! because it's not for everyone, if you like ARMA 2 or military, FPS shooters (not COD, thats more like an arcade game) then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market. If you think this game is full on, arcade style action packs bullets,bombs and metal flying all over the place, it's not, but it's just as fun as one of those games.
1565	1	a	arma 3 is awesome!
1567	1	a	[/h1]'One of the best Simulators in the world. By far the best Military Sim I have ever seen.'[/h1]  [/u][PROS]:[/u]  -You can run this on low settings preety well if you have a low-end system like me.  -If you have a beast system there are some mods to improve graphics (ENB's, Textures, etc.)  -The game is very lively. Lots of mods to fill in if you are bored.  -Eden editor will be coming soon so be hyped for that. (Not saying the normal editor is bad :P)  -The workshop has some awesome scenarios with a lot of detail (custom voices, custom guns &amp; vehicles, etc.)  -Campaign mod is decent, some missions may be hard and frustrating but all worth it in the end.  -Extensive amount of vanilla weaponry and vehicles.  -Oh how could I forget EXILE!! One of the funnest mods for ARMA 3!  [/u][CONS]:[/u]  -Price of $60.00 USD.   -Pray to god you have friends that play ARMA 3 because from what I know you won't make many friends.  -If you live in far away from Europe or America (such as Australia), A3Laucher will take a long time to download mods like AIA Terrain Pack, and other maps, forcing you to torrent or pray someone uploaded to MEGA or MediaFire.  -DLCs are too expensive and should be given out for free or for (I'll be nice) $5 each being it lacks content and does not stand for the 20$ each price tag.  Overall this game is freaking awesome, if you are bored, GET THIS GAME. You will not regret it!  -Shurik     Thanks for reading you sexy person! &lt;3      
1569	1	a	I don't play Arma 3 seriously enough to make a in depth review but most of the time when I get on with friends we have a blast
1571	1	a	a wonderfully satisfying pc game,many game-modes, huge maps, plenty vehicles, awesone weapons, ect. definetly worth the $59.99
1573	1	a	After god-knows how many hours on this game, I finally decided to review it.  The gameplay is absolutely amazing, mind you bloody difficult to learn at first. The servers range from things as simple as a king of the hill match, to full out no restrictions war zones full of snipers, infantrymen, armour and airborne demons. I definetly would reccommend this to anywho want an immersive, hyper-realistic military simulator with near endless modding opportunities.  Home to the new, updated Epoch which was popular on Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead.                                              If you doubt how good it is, check out gameplay videos or screenshots. Do eit.
1575	1	a	Want a game where you can do practically anything? A military simulator that can also turn into a horror experience, GTA-style free-world multiplayer maps, or Zombie post-apocalyptic wasteland. Recommended for single-player and multi-player fun, casual and hardcore style of play.
1577	1	a	This game offers an experience like no other, although the learning curve is quite steep and boring. this game offers literally everything from RPG environments to hardcore milsim groups. if you like shooter games but you want a little more diversity and some more possibilities then this is a game for you!  My personal experiences with arma games could not be better, with a mature community and helpfull forums aswell as an awesome modding community, i have spent hundreds of hours playing everything from wasteland to missions with my friends, and editing/scripting missions.  what have I gained from this game?  +  awesome experiences  +  really good keyboard controll  +  basic scripting knowledge  +  Some fat  &lt;3    +  awesome friends  +  700+ hours of amazing fun!   10/10 do recommend!  
1579	1	a	AI suck's but good game
1581	1	a	Great game, wish It could run better on my PC but the game itself is awesome.
1583	1	a	It is what battlefield 3/4 should of bin.   Great game anyone who loved Bf2 should get this game
1585	1	a	I went from shooting a guy in the head to racing around in gokarts with machineguns attached to them. 10/10 would play again
1587	1	a	this game is a simulation and it takes alot of tatics to play so if you like tactics and realistic games then this game is for you 
1589	1	a	With almost 1.5k hours logged so far I can say this is the best game I have ever played.
1591	1	a	I really enjoy this game. This game is different to other wargames. You can make your own missions, the graphics are epic and the maps are 200KM big! You can play alone or with friends. Either way you will enjoy this game. I suggest this game to anyone who is wanting good gameplay and epic battles.
1593	1	a	Quite simply the best game of its genre. With the many hours of community made missions and the 8n game editor, there is so much to do in this game that will keep you occupied for a long time
1595	1	a	Good game maybe a little work but i see a lot of mods being made in futrue.
1597	1	a	This game is a definite improvement over it's predecessor, despite the optimization issues for those running lower level Intel rigs or mid-high level AMD rigs. Even on low this game looks impressive and if you have an Intel CPU (or high level AMD CPU) &amp; Decent GPU (Either brand) you should be able to run it on high where the visuals are sure to impress.  The AI has improved over ARMA II, though not tremendously, You will still have issues commanding your squad to do exactly what you want them to but they're not quite as derpy.  If you decide to get this game you're definitely going to have fun with it, I strongly reccommend to google custom optimisation settings and tinker with it until you have the most stable frames you can achieve.  Finally, the modding community for this game is excellent, there are plenty of great mods on the workshop and community sites like ARMAHOLIC.
1599	1	a	Really well built game! They certainly did not disapoint with this one!!
1601	1	a	Definitely YES! one of the best games I ever played and the biggest in content by far. You will never find yourself out of content here!
1603	1	a	I played the alpha sadly. there was too many bugs. so I disliked it and kept staying at arma 2. after arma 2's shutdown and all the stuff arma 2 oa and arma 2 got I've got my hands on arma 3 a bit. I liked the game. I would like to buy it too
1605	1	a	Wonderful game, Physics, Tactics. Most realistic shooter on the market #ForSteamBadge
1607	1	a	Awesome game. If you played Bohemia's other games in the series, Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA, then you HAVE to get this. The graphics are beautiful (although you need a good computer obviously to run it well) the combat still feels a little stiff, but it's a huge improvement from the last games. They added an actual working physics engine and the features (inventory system, gun attachments, etc.) are top notch. The use of tactic and strategy is required so if you like that kind of stuff then you'll like this. It's still a pretty early release so I'm sure they will be releasing more vehicles and guns soon. Also, it comes equipped with the steam workshop, which is amazing considering steam's community is great at making modifications that make the game ten times better. Just get the damn game already!
1609	1	a	10/10, Great game and a great mods for it
1611	1	a	Truly game that can call its self a simulator.  I have tons of fun with it and i always get amazed at how good the graphics look. There is a ton of things to do. you can play around the missions of the single player displaying all kinds of combat situations. You could create your own made scenario and share it with others. You can also live edit the combat events with the new Zeus patch while playing multiplayer.   The game also features an realistic ballistic system including bullet drop, shooting through walls (also decreases damage), and bullet speed. and these are effected by the type of weapon you use and what kind of ammunition.  Also the game has a lot of vehicles you can mess around with. Boats, cars, tanks. Helicopters, planes, drones and even submersibles. And if that isnâ€™t enough for you than you could visited the stream workshop for many more vehicles. Weapons, and combat scenarioâ€™s.  I defiantly approve of this game! 
1613	1	a	i luv this game it has amazing graphics but there is one problem with playing! that is you need a group of freinds
1615	1	a	Great shooter based in realism and skill. Extremely variable multiplayer makes this game enjoyable and exciting every time you start with new challenges and experiences to boot.  Basically it's Arma.
1617	1	a	Do you want Realism? Well let me tell you in simple details how fuc**** awesome this game is!!! Sure, a few glitches and errors but when you get it, You'll say its all worth the investment. This simulator beats all of the other Armed Assualt series.... by Graphics... meaning; texture,terrain, and others. The sound is.... GREAT, just needs a little tweak. Customization for soldiers... wicked!!! I would recommend this game by my fullest ability. No game can beat the realism of this game. 'It's just simply Astonishing &amp; Jaw-Dropping'
1619	1	a	Extremely Tactical, incredibly fun to play with friends. For people looking for a real military spec ops feel this is the game to get. The giant maps and the ability to edit and create your own missions allows for infinite possibilities of gameplay.
1621	1	a	I have played this game for over a year now and I can honestly say it is fantastic. There are so many mods that improve the game and add amazing new content. An example of this would be the DayZ mod called Exile. But there are plenty of fun things you can do in this game like playing life servers that don't require mods. The new DLC called apex is set to come out in a week or two and it adds a crazy new map and I can't wait for it. There is so much to do on multiplayer and there are so many populated servers that have really fun modes that you can play alone or with friends. Additionally, the vehicles, both land and air, are really well designed, easy to drive and fun to use. Plus the upcoming DLC is adding VTOLs that look amazing! I would honestly recommend this game.
1623	1	a	Gameplay and sound effects are great, this is a good military simulator, campaign has a great story but no replay value except for the last mission of Ep 3: Win. Editor is very smooth and easy to use.
1625	1	a	offline-60+ fps constant @ ultra settings online-25 fps @ lowest settings  apart from the terrible servers this game is amazing, in my opinion its the best military sim to date, at max settings the game pulls just over 2gb of gpu memory in a heavy area (i.e towns with heavy foliage and lots of buildings) it runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware ( as i'v tested) and is easy to achieve solid 60 fps on all hardware at good settings   
1627	1	a	Slow-paced and heavily strategic/tactical. It's a game that may not be 'fun', but it can be very immersive and tries to give you a breathtaking experience. If you're one of those guys that likes hardcore realistic simulation, then this game is definitely the best out there. Also it's more than just a game, it's a platform that has plenty of mods to keep you busy when the original theme of the game is not quite what you're looking for.
1629	1	a	A big open wonderful military sandbox that is made even better by its active and passionate modding community.
1631	1	a	Arma has a love hate relationship, but overall is a fantastic game.
1633	1	a	Very Good gameplay and great mechanics, a tad poorly optimised but runs okay and highly playable. I Dont have a bad rig (HD 7990, FX 8350, Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 and 16 GB ram) but cant run any better than high with just 4xMSAA. be nice to run on ultra with 8 on this card as it is definately capable
1635	1	a	Arma 3 is one, maybe, the best military shooter on earth.  I played ~1k+ Hours and can say: Well done Bohemia, well done.  This game is so f*cking massiv.   You can spend so much time, in much more Mods, Maps and Missions.   The steamworkshop is full with single- and coopmissons.  So u can spend so much time in play vs. bots without or with friends.   If u check the serverlist, u can see this game offers much more than the same s*it.   There server for each priority.  If u like like battelfield - King of the Hill [KotH] If u like hard close- also rangecombat man by man - BattleRoyal If u like to play a character, play in a 'virtual' world - Life Server/RP Server  In sale this awesome game cost only ~17â‚¬-25â‚¬. Buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Buy it!
1637	1	a	Forget CoD, forget BF or any other pseudo military FPS. This is game is the real deal. I can not express how much fun and how into this game I can get. Every aspect of it is amazing; on ground, flying a jet or operating a tank. This is as close as you can get to the real thing. Graphically (and audio) beautiful and divine, realistic in every aspect. What more could you want? You can't, because this game is it. The thing I love about Arma (and always have) is that, it's the game you make it and want it to be. You want a non-broken DayZ? Breakingpoint. You want sector control? King of the hill. You want a death match? Wasteland. Team co-op? Invade and Annex. I could go on. If you enjoy games where you actually have to work, think, become involved and immersed then Arma3 should already be on your steam list.
1639	1	a	I played Altis Life and told people I was going to bite their fingers off. Then got nicknamed Finger Fetish    10/10 game.
1641	1	a	ARMA  that is all
1643	1	a	Half the time I don't know what I'm doing or who i'm trying to kill.
1645	1	a	I love this game so mutch why? you can play on a open sandbox map, there are like tons of mods out for Arma 3, Co-op missions, Deathmatches, RolePlay-Life mods, it has everything for everyone, actually too mutch to mention i just love it!! 
1647	1	a	Arma 3 is turning out to be a great game, with problems at the start which knocked my confidence it has now bounced back and is shining
1649	1	a	This game is total sweets
1651	1	a	good game iwth weapon resting mod. i got aids and lived to tel l this tale,
1653	1	a	my hours say it all lol... i spend way to much time on that game. it is awesome ..wish i was better with the gun to get the full exp. it is well worth the money :)
1655	1	a	Deffinatly recomend this game, ive spent over 800hrs on this and have loved every bit of it!!!!!!!!!!
1657	1	a	Outstanding. Closest you can get to realistic military tactical gameplay!
1659	1	a	This game is a simulator not just a traditional shooter,The full experience of the game Lies in its multiplayer that although does have many game types and modes to choose from,nothing beats 'Tactical Realism' based modes . Thats where the game shines, where team work is required every step of the way to complete a common goal. There are clans that host Organized combat events, where you get the full deal with ranks and comanders feeding down orders through the chain of command, I've played with a few of these realism clans like the 7Cav, 77Jaysowk and i've even played in one of the public events of the 'SOF' Clan and plenty more i cant seem to remember off the top of my head, the arma 3 Community in general is a very warm and welcoming one as i saw during my participation with the people in these clan communites.   No doubt this game isnt for the Average joe, its not about score and killstreaks and action around every corner,  its a simulator and its all about Tactics,Patience,skill and above all Teamwork  P.S. if you're new to this game you'll probably need a program called 'TeamSpeak 3' for multiplayer, its like a virtual radio and we use it for the majority of multiplayer communication
1661	1	a	Very enjoyable war simulator. The story is a little weak but who cares when it looks this good. The multiplayer is what it's all about really with a variety of servers and game modes. 7.5/10
1663	1	a	This is one of the best games I've played so far - its so many gamemodes and maps you can download from the workshop that is very nicely built. Every games has it's ups and downs, but theres nothing in Arma that really makes you think that this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. 9/10 due to some weird physics.
1665	1	a	I could tell you all about this game after near 800hrs (790hr at the time of writing).. but I won't because I don't want any Call of Duty or Battlefield Fanboys coming in and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing up my game :) - I mean, really i should tell you to buy it because the only thing Arma shares with CoD and BF is that you shoot people..OK well CoD I haven't liked since Modern Warfare 2 and BF I grew out of as it was a good series that basically just got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all over by big companies seeking quick profits. Anyway Arma on the otherhand has been around just as long as these two but perhaps didn't spend so much on its marketing campaign and put more of its budget into making their games? I can't say for sure, but if you're into realism (not photorealism, like you call of duty spastics) and Military Simulation types whether it be Tank Sims, Combat Flight Sims or just good old fashioned FPS types of games, you're probably going to enjoy some part of ArmA.. Thats one group of people that could enjoy this, then theres the creative types.. Have you ever wanted to drop a Fishing Trawler from 20,000ft onto an Airport runway filled with fuel trucks, planes, helicopters, tanks, cars whatever you fancy, just for fun.. to test your PC's capacity or performance? you can do this. Have you ever thought of a scenario and wanted to see how it might play out with two or more opposing factions in some kind of freaky multi-national royal rumble in the middle of nowhere with armour, air and infantry forces going at each other ? I know I never did until I played with the Mission editor in Arma 2, I played around making small missions in the previous games but not really until arma 3 did i experiment with weird â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like that.. it's quite fun for wasting time, and it looks great..   Anyway, you guys could keep reading or you could be downloading it as you read.. its worth whatever the price is at the moment.. I don't really care how much it is, it's worth it. I've been playing this series since 2001 in the very beginning back when it was a Codemasters game Operation Flashpoint.. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome game. If you're currently in the military, plan to enlist in the future or have previously served and want realism - buy Arma.. join a tactical realism clan or milsim group depending on your preference.. they're both the same to me.. immersive groups are best.  **Warning** not so much a warning, but if you have PTSD and are triggered easily, perhaps this isn't your thing having PTSD myself I can safely say, this game will scare the absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of you occasionally, depending on how you play and what triggers you or maybe just ease into it I can't tell you not to get it, it's an awesome game.. just try to remember that it's just a game. Easier said than done in some cases like mine.. I couldn't play properly for a week but that's another story that I don't think you need to know about ha.. Best game ever - possibly not best storyline, I liked Arma 2's campaign better but everything else in Arma 3 is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME! - Don't take my word for it though, try it out - oh did I mention upto 64 player online multiplayer coop, pvp etc and thousands of servers internationally (I'm Australian and even we have low ping servers to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around on).. ahh I think that's it.. I chose not to technically review the game because it doesn't need a review, there are plenty out there just don't go with any saying anything negative about it, there's very few things that I don't like about it.. and the list gets smaller each day with the devs constantly releasing new fixes or DLC buy this game, I bought it in it's Alpha stage and the list of bugs was relatively small back then so you can imagine what it's like now after having been out officially over a year now ;-)
1667	1	a	arma 3 is the best simulator out yet!!! recomended for everyone:D 
1669	1	a	I have almost 120 hours in this game and i still dont know half what it got to offer. it is simply the best game of 2013. if you is wondering wether or not to buy the game so buy it. the editor is the best way to experinece all the vehicles. play it as the game is ment to be played and you will enjoy it. if you are an battlefield or COD player dont buy this it is slow phased and you dont get you healt back after 5 seconds so buy it if you like slow phased and realistic games. this is the best way i can describe it. I have to go and play the game
1671	1	a	GG! Good game, love it +1
1673	1	a	If youÂ´re looking for a game thats both realistic and fun at the same time then this is the game for you.
1675	1	a	Worth every penny, This is a combat millitary game with gorgues massive battlefields. Every inch of this game amazing from the Sea combat to Air Combat. I, Lorddwarvin Recommend this game ! Buy this game now!
1677	1	a	GENERAL. Arma 3 is an amazing game that simulates real military action,objectives and tactics.Once you start the game for the first time you will see that there are tonns of controls  and commands,but you'll get the hang off it eventually. We'll start off with the campaign.You play as corpral kerry in the NATO forces.Altis and Stratis the two main islands are being invaded by CSAT(bad guys).Even though there is nothing you can do about it,the NATO forces are trying to  force them back,and near the end of the campaign you have  two choices, try and find out where james(friend) is or play a part in the final stand against CSAT,depending on the choice  you choose you could win or lose.The map editor is a good addition, it alows you to create your own missions or you could just tour upand down the islands like i do.The scenery on the  islands look amazing and realistic and driving at night is even better. The realistic weather is by far the best weather you'll see in a  long time,like if the start of a mission is suny the weather will probably change drasticaly.It is also very easy to get lost in the vast open world at night but the accurate star map should help you find your way. Also look out for animals like goats,deer and rabbits on land,in the sea there are fish,turtles and sharks to make you nervous when diving. There is a dedicated community on steam workshop,they create player made missions, weapons,vehicles and mods.   There are also updates rolling in frequently to improve the game.  AIRCRAFT. The aircraft in the game look well designed from helicopters to jet fighters but you do have to be a certified aircraft pilot if you  want to play multiplayer or a lot of people will laugh at you because you crashed the 3 million dollar aircraft.  LAND VEHICLES. The land vehicles also look well designed.The selection of tanks in the game are plentiful.The civilian cars are good for exploring the huge islands and The infintry transport look and drive just  like they should.  WATER TRANSPORT. There aren't as much boats as there are land vehicles but there  doesn't need to be.There are 2 civilian boats and 2 military boats. There are also submarines as well.  Pros 1 Great simulation. 2 Big open world to explore. 3 Amazing scenery. 4 Well designed vehicles.  cons 1 Hard to learn aircraft piloting.  Over all score 8/10
1679	1	a	Little bit of everything in this game. With hundreds of mission files to choose from, each server has its own unique features. Worth a buy.
1681	1	a	Very awesome game, simulates how war is very well, If you liked Arma 2, you will love this. You can play online such as Wasteland which is fun. I've had this game since they released it.
1683	1	a	This game is amazing .. That is all I have to say about that .. IF you into games that allow no limits to what you can do with it .. Arma is the game for you. With Modding supported from the start of the game and really the core of arma. Spending 60 bucks on Arma is more then worth it. I have over 1000 hours now into the Arma series and have yet to play any of the campian that BI made. Most of my time has been into Mods like Dayz and Epoch. The Communtiy in Arma is amazing. Modders put their heart and soul into making content for this game. Arma 3 is a game you will for sure get over 5 years of content for free out of. It is a must buy for any Hardcore FPS player, Hardcore RPG player or any one into Mil Sim stuff.
1685	1	a	This is a lovley game. I have trouble finding immersion in games but this game is where its at. I can sit an play this game for hours on end and not get bored. Has an amazing story and the multiplayer is just great. There is zero reason to not have this game. 11/10 Amazing job Bohemia.  *Note even though it has some bugs i only find those relevent in multiplayer and its not even that bad. Doesnt take away from the game at all in my opinion.
1687	1	a	Really amazing game Massivly Multiplayer Plus Online Mods.
1689	1	a	Great game, played on free weekend, runs well and great graphics, only wish I could've kept it longer.
1691	1	a	Fantastic game with a mind blowing amount of customization and a great modding community. The game is a military sim and is quite true to the details. Though I will stress this game is very complex when it comes to the controls and customization. As of now there is no easy way to create a 'loadout' without coding in some nasty box of text. There is plans to fix this. But just be warned this game does require decent understanding of PC gaming due to mass amount of controls and options there is big leaning curve. But I would high recommend this game.
1693	1	a	There is something simply exciting about Arma 3, and for me it is primarily driven by the moddibility of the game. From Vanilla to 20+ mods, every aspect is quite enteraining. Even after nearly 1000 hours of gameplay I continue to enjoy Arma with my friends in the Tac-Ops Gamming Community. Arma 3 is worth its prce serveral times over.
1695	1	a	This game is great combines between FPS and simulation, in a realistic environments it got everything a game needs, starting with the amazing graphics, sounds, ambient effects, everything gameplay is great, &amp; steam workshop got some of the best mods you'll ever imagine, great game, a must have.
1697	1	a	Best Military sim out there. You can do anything and the community is great. Alot of addons to download, missions and people even make awsome gamemodes.
1699	1	a	This game is a a lot of fun for the right players. Looking for non-stop spawn and die? Then it's prolly not for you. Looking for some slower paced tactical action mixed with some intense battles? It's in there.
1701	1	a	It's a pretty, and awesome game, highly recomend it!
1703	1	a	This game is worth every penny, a bang for your buck.  Lots of mods, a huge player base.  It does have a high learning curve, but once you master it, you will have a great war simulator.
1705	1	a	I wish I liked this game. It's a good game, yeah, but I just don't like it for some reason.
1707	1	a	Vastly improved in movement, combat, and functionality, ArmA 3 is a big improvement graphically and gameplay wise. The content inside although, is nowhere to be seen. It's still a pretty barren game, with only 1 episode of the campaign. But it is still very fun, and I do reccomend it to fans of the ArmA series and even newcomers. Just wait for the modding community to fix most of the problems.
1709	1	a	This game is amazing. Its stupidly immersive, and you get right in to it. I highly recommend joining a group which fits anything you want. Want something casual, or light, there's a group out there for that. Want something realistic, milsim style? Group for that.  The amount of things this game can do is amazing, and worth the money if this is your style of game.
1711	1	a	By far the best sandbox shooter to ever come out. The game is enriching and engaging, there is no shortage of mods and the game keeps getting better by constant developer updates and the community contributions. Everyone in their right mind who claims to be a PC Gamer should play this game.  Bohemia's dedication to the developement and improvement of this game is astonishing, one of the very few developers who actually keep their word of 'constant updates' and 'community oriented updates,' the game has come a LONG way and the way it's going with the HUGE level of content I can only wait to see what else the developer's has in store.
1713	1	a	One of the best games i ever played.
1715	1	a	It's good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ buy it
1717	1	a	Very cool game, it has a lot of modes,and they are fun. i recommend to play this games when you are in a group :D.
1719	1	a	Great game, flawless graphics and minimal online bugs.  Great work
1721	1	a	I recommend this game. It's currently my favorite tactical shooter.
1723	1	a	Arma 3 is an amazing game, however I'd reccomend doing your research before considering purchasing it. I personally am not a massive fan of 'life' servers or that sorta thing, and I think public servers that try to be tactical are (with the exeption of a select few) mostly terrible. The base game has a decent ammount of content, but I personally can't deal with the AI and can't stand the single player. The BEST thing about Arma 3 is mods. Mods, Mods, Mods.   Mods fix many of Arma's intrinsic problems and provide you with more content than you could ever want. It turns Arma from an okay-shooter to... well, pretty much anything. Life servers, Milsim groups, more relaxed tactical groups (my preference) - Arma 3 is the BEST sandbox shooter out there and, assuming there's something you're interested in, it's definately worth the price.
1725	1	a	I uh, I miss sunlight and civilization.  10/10, would recommend.
1727	1	a	Very Good Game!!!
1729	1	a	This MilSim blows CoD, BF, and CS:GO out of the water with PCMLs, A-10s, UAVs, T-100s, and rocks.  Ladies and gentlemen, War in the 21st Century  *BATTLEFIELD BUZZ PFFFFF PFFFF PFFFFFFF*
1731	1	a	The best game ever.
1733	1	a	10 out of 10 would bang
1735	1	a	When i started playing this game I noticed it was lagging so I changed the settings to get it running right then i joined a server i killed a guy and his arms started flailing after that my game crashed...  My pc said logic.exe has stopped working Windows is checking for a solution to the problem  10/10 would crash logic.exe again
1737	1	a	If you are looking for another FPS to play like COD, this is not for you. This game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games. The situations that you have to adapt to, the fact that the map is about 19 sq. km, and how fluid everything is compared to Arma II, thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most. This game is not for any COD player (or Battlefield at that) that just wants to shoot people for fun. Once you get used to everything and how the game is played, it really latches on to you. Especially when you have some buddies to bring with you.
1739	1	a	great game, i have had it since very early alpha and i have a total playtime of almost 700 hours. the game is great in itself and offers many different ways of play. mods are also great for the game (dont get too many as it ruins the game)  all dlc's are great and the game is a close to real (basically the most real game avalible) and it covers a range of factions and teams (military,civvilian etc.....)  i really reccoment this game to all !!!!!
1741	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played and certainly the best military simulator that i have ever played. Astonishing graphics (especially with SweetFX), enourmous map, awesome workshop submissions and a very civilized and friendly community that will help you get started with the mil-sim as well as all the other game/mission types.
1743	1	a	Played this game for over 1000 hours now and have come to realise something. The community (as a whole) is terrible.There is only ever a handful of helpful people on any of the forums, and the game is slowly losing its multiplayer enjoyability due to the saturation of Altis/Stratis Life and Wasteland servers, and it's choking the game of it's more diverse gametypes. If ever somebody tries releasing a new mod/mission it get's pushed to the side by all of the older gametypes. Personally I feel that Life servers are on their last legs, but until they aren't popular anymore every other innovative, fun, dynamic and diverse mission is cast in shadow.Take a look at the Multiplayer server list. All you can see is Wasteland, Life and the odd Invade &amp; Annex server. Quite frankly it's annoying the hell out of me. It seems that these days to get some really diverse gameplay you need to either create a private server to play with some friends, but then you're lacking the player base, join a community but even then the majority are Life-based or join a Mil-Sim unit, which many have age restrictions and timezone issues with schedules that you must abide by or you're out! Another issue is the amount of little kids playing the game. I'm 16, so I'm by no means an adult, but when I'm playing a MILITARY SIMULATOR I don't wanna see or hear 12 year olds running around like it's CoD. If somebody with a high pitched voice starts talking to me in such a way that I know they are taking the game seriously then I appreciate that. However, I've only ever come across that 3 times. If they want to have fun, by all means, but not in a way that is detrimental to the success of the mission / aim of the game, like shooting teammates just because it's a feature they haven't seen in CoD and they think it's funny to annoy somebody by always playing as a sniper and picking off targets of no importance coz they wanna see how far of a shot they can hit. These are flaws in the community though, not the game. I must admit, the game itself has some issues... *cough* rocks *cough* ...but as a whole it is a great game! I wouldn't have spent as long as I have on it if I didn't enjoy it. The graphics are stunning, they level to detail blows my mind and you get a genuine adrenaline kick during the kick-a$$ firefights that this game offers. Definately worth buying this game, so long as you aren't afraid to wade through the bull$hit for the good bits, that is...
1745	1	a	11/10 Ran away from the cops for smoking weed.
1747	1	a	Realistic coop/multiplayer game and singleplayer offcourse, I can already tell that this game is based on teamwork and it's awesome. good job bohemia!
1749	1	a	Nothing is more glorious than helping lead a small army of gamers through clearing a city. Posting up and covering their advance with a suppressed sniper rifle, or using Artillery and coordinated attacks to level entire blocks before your comrades advance on the target.  I play Vanilla though, and honestly haven't been able to find any good populated servers running that.  Most servers you'll find are Altis Life, Epoch or the like. If this is cool with you, and you can take the fact that unless your PC is worth 2K$ you wont get anything above 34FPS, then I'd say its worth getting this game.
1751	1	a	Its a really amazing game, very realistic and a variety of different gametypes. I really recommend it!
1753	1	a	love it really good game
1755	1	a	While I do recommend this game, it's only thanks to Arma's modding community. And well in advance. Because, while there already are some very good mods and missions for Arma 3, the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from Arma 2.   As for the game itself in its vanilla form: thumbs down. Bad net code, bad design, awful single-player campaign, terrible bugs (like AI twitching when you hit them with your fire). Technologically Arma 3 is stuck in 2009. Graphics don't age well, it already looks outdated, while being very demanding resource wise - bad optimization.  Unfortunately, Arma 3 doesn't have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare. While every aspect of Arma 3 is done poorly, it's the only game that comes with all of it in one package.
1757	1	a	best war simulation  best war game  Perfect Multiplayer .... I love thissssssss game
1759	1	a	great game
1761	1	a	This game needs a good pc but its worth getting one for it. Being a sandbox moddable game its less of a game and more a engine for tons of games. Once you mod it has every option to play from super realistic (as much as a game could offer) to Halo type games.
1763	1	a	Buy this awesome simulator, and it doesnt need high powered computer for graphs!
1765	1	a	Plays Battlefield for years on console thinks it's amazing... Build's a new PC from scratch... Buy's Arma 3... Has Org@sm... That is all.
1767	1	a	Amazing game good graphics 
1769	1	a	I have 1.3k hr's in game all I can say this game is epic. Find a group of friend's and jump in the combat of this game is the best I have ever been in. My fave game mode's are Wasteland and Altis life (Join the servers some time as well come hang with us and have fun on arma if you have no one else. Fractured Wasteland, Darkside Altis Life) Enjoy have fun and shoot loads of people. :P
1771	1	a	10/10 zeus is to much fun
1773	1	a	If you mess up on the campaign, you have to go waaay back to try again, so I wouldn't recommend this game if you'll buy it for the campain. Multiplayer is pretty nice, one of those games you have to wait 20 minutes to see your opponent's body, and still you won't shoot, because it will attract others. Very nice, you ought to think fast it you want to be the best. Totally recommend.
1775	1	a	It is one of the most amazing games I played over the course of this year!
1777	1	a	This game Is loads of fun, I love it
1779	1	a	Its the best game ever, appart from Halk-Life 1
1781	1	a	Pros: Military sandbox game with great gunplay, projectile physics, and ballistics, a robust editor, and has a multitude of custom missions and mods, all of which allow for countless possibilities for infantry, vehicle, and combined operations.  Cons: Performance ranges from great to terrible and is arbitrary, awkward movement system in close quarters, and subpar hit detection at times when playing multiplayer.
1783	1	a	Arma 3 is a realistic shooter, if your looking for COD type of game this is not it!
1785	1	a	I'm a person who doesn't really love the FPS genre, I always looked at games like COD and was wondering, why do people keep playing that?  ... I still have no idea, but what I do know is that Arma is one of kind game. It's realism and gameplay just took me away. Its huge beautiful maps are like a gigantic playground, that one you always wished, when you were little.  Anyways this game became one of my favorite games in about 3 weeks time, and I can't stop!  Thank you developers, thank you modders, and ofcourse thank yoy community, for making this game such a great one!  
1787	1	a	This is a good game. :P
1789	1	a	This game is not for the console kids that play COD all day. This is a difficult but fun game. If you look at the negative reviews on it the reviewers have 300 to 700+ hours in this game... thats not the amount of hours you put in this game if you dont like it.... I dont get it.. Anyways. If you choose to buy this game get VAC. It will save your life. The community behind this game is huge and there is always new player created missions and content available. Theres also breaking point mod for arma 3. Basically Dayz for Arma 3. Which I think is better than SA. The guys saying they get low fps... one saying he gets 10 frames?? Its a demanding game... play it on something besides the laptop you bought at Wal-Mart... Bohemia labels it a military sim... thats what it is. It's most def not a run and shoot.
1791	1	a	Great game, better with friends... Modding Arma brings it into it's own, I've hunted(and been hunted by) dinosaurs, ridden in mechs, escaped the same damned island time and time again, been part of 100 player missions, robbed banks, smuggled heroine, been a trucker, raided bases in exile/dayz/wasteland/breaningpoint/whateverthenewpoisonis and done much much more.
1793	1	a	85/100
1795	1	a	Best military simulator i've ever played. All it's missing is tons of weapons. But what it has is great!
1797	1	a	Great Game With Altis Life Mod
1799	1	a	Arma 3 brings back all of your favorite characters from the Arma 2!   Like army guy 1, 2, and 4.  The story is captivating and will keep you enthralled for hours.
1801	1	a	Arma 3 is an expansive military simulator that excels beyond any game I can think of off the top of my head in both realism and graphics. As a PC gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like FPS).  It is really fun and is potentially a mix of an FPS, RPG and Military simulator (with sandbox!)  The Steam Workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...
1803	1	a	this is a good game it is fun to play but i think the intro with the helicopter is a bit to long for my liking  i would give this game a 4 out of 5
1805	1	a	This is a really good game if you like war sims and just fooling around on a big map with lots of weps and cars.  BOTTOM LINE its just fun
1807	1	a	10/10
1809	1	a	This game has a lot of potential. Can't wait to see what becomes of it through the community.
1811	1	a	This game goes like......  Group Leader NPC: '2 FORM ON ME' 'ENEMY UNKNOWN MAN FAR' 'HOLD FIRE' 'FIRE' 'HOLD FIRE' Me: 'MAKE UP YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MIND!' NPC LEADER: Unknown Chopper Far Me:  HOW THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS A CHOPPER UNKNOWN DAMNIT My Mind:  Hey im smart lets take pot shots at enemys yay *Gets out of cover for one second and gets blown away* *Starts yelling insults at the game* *Friend on Skype tells you to calm the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ down* 11/10 would get shot in the face by sniper again!
1813	1	a	People tend to play this for the military simulator, well I don't... There is this Arma 3 altis life mode. A mode made by community where I get all my hours and fun from where you can earn money with fishing drug smuggling, mining, selling stolen cars... Well now I am a little bit more experienced and joined the cops so fun to play on the Grandtheftarma server! Just check out a video on youtube Arma 3 altis life  10/10 game just like counter-strike
1815	1	a	GET THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY
1817	1	a	Great fun game that takes time to get good at but its worth the 59.99!
1819	1	a	Good game. Can do almost anything thanks to the modding support. I strongly recommend Altis Life, A3Wasteland, and possibly Arma 3 Epoch when it gets out of alpha.
1821	1	a	Better then crack but runs like trash...
1823	1	a	I have mixed opinions about AMRMA III.  The good:  Beautiful game Great squad command module Lots of weapons and vehicles The bad: GAMEPLAY So, the game is really great, but I just don't find it fun to play. It's really realistis, almost too realistic, and if the player can't succeed, what's the point? Otherwise, it's a great game
1825	1	a	In Zeus mode you can spawn hundreds of goats and blow them all up with artillery....  GOTY right here boys!
1827	1	a	I really like the game. It is really fun and almost all the way realistic. Just sometimes when you fall like 5-10 feet you die. Which is ridiculous iand stupid. I would rate this game a 8/10.
1829	1	a	Arma 3 is an absolutely amazing game. Some servers can be laggy but that is not the games fault. It is such a good game with many things to do and the graphics are amazing its just like real life (in a way) Arma 3 is amazing.
1831	1	a	An incredible creation for those with right tools, I strongly suggest the use of a mid-high end CPU as well as at least 8GB of RAM at a half decent speed/latancy (This game is heavily CPU intensive but does not really take advantage of high end GPUs) Without the right hardware my friend, you are in for a hard time when it comes to smooth gameplay with higher textures. The thing to take away from this is make sure your system is in order to avoid disapointment.  Speaking of gameplay, ARMA 3 is a massively satisfying game to master and the enjoyment and immersion levels are second to none. The campaign (whilst not on the same levels as ARMA 2's Harvest Red) is a great experience with a relatively good story line and very tactical gameplay.  Multiplayer- The possibilities are endless, Altis Life, Wasteland, Warfare, MILSIM, Deathmatch, Exile... The list goes on and then some if you bring mods into the equation. ARMA 3's multiplayer experience is definitely centred on the community aspect, which I love dearly.  Pros: -Active modding community -Great graphics/attention to detail -Engaging and exciting storyline with memorable characters -Immensely satisfying gameplay offline or online  Cons: -Consider investing in a high end CPU -Pricey DLCs (They gotta keep the bandwagon moving somehow bare in mind) -Of course there's bugs for christ's sake, stop climbing up sheer rocks or playing on dev branch!  Overall I really do reccomend ARMA3 to the military enthusiast to the casual FPS gamer:) Enjoy.
1833	1	a	Why is this not on your games list? Get it. Now.
1835	1	a	I recommend this game , the graphics are amazing , it has easy to learn controls and the maps are huge
1837	1	a	Best first person shooter ive ever played! Challenging, realistic, wide open,you name it... its in this game. Even vehicals got their realisticness maxed out!
1839	1	a	day 1: spawned in made some money walked off some stairs died  day 2: got some cannabis seeds ran and jumped a rail landed on rocks..... died medic came revived me died again medic revived me died again medic left me  day 3: knicked a guy out and legged it  day 4: stole some dudes kart and crashed it  day 5: got taken to the hospital after being revived to have free jelly nek minute guy rocks up and takes us hostage i escape get a gun and come back. Police tell me to go away but i sneak in. i see a cop and panick i kill the cop every body runs what seemed like a heroic rescue mission went to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. got arrested  day 6: im an nvidia enthusiast  1/10-IGN 74/49- GAMESPOT  oh yea and i almost â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing vomited because of the hectic framedrop and unoptimization
1841	1	a	Probably the best MilSim game i have ever played, 10/10
1843	1	a	Arma 3 is one of the coolest free roam army shooter that I have played I have played it for 66 hours with only me and my two friend you don't need much friend for this game just one or two or three arma has lots of other game mode there is modes like Sandbox you can spawn items theres wasteland survive and found items like guns and cars so I give ArmA III a 7/10
1845	1	a	Amazing game. All i can say. Arma 3 or any Arma game isnt like cod. This is a strategy game. Not a game where you can camp in a corner with an Lmg. I highly recommend this game for everyone. accept squekers. 
1847	1	a	I don't even own this game, but it's so good that I have transcended the mortal boundaries of Steam to write this.  &gt;starts a campaign game &gt;instantly sniped by AI in the first fight &gt;reload save game &gt;rinse and repeat  It's a very good military sandbox. Trust me, it's worth the weight.  
1849	1	a	better than cod lol
1851	1	a	I like this game because it promotes same sex relationships.  In a firefight I was told to engage a man.
1853	1	a	great game
1855	1	a	So within 5 minutes of playing the game I was approached by a player named 'Megatron' who offered me and my friend cocaine and $1,000.   While high on cocaine a masked man came up and killed my friend. Then some awesome medic in a helicopter revived him.  Shortly after someone kidnapped my friend and killed him while prenting to masterbate.  I'm hooked.
1857	1	a	This game is very enjoyable, my personal favorite game mode is Wasteland because it takes the least ammount of time to get into the action. The game has amazing graphics and the game play is extremely enjoyable. I personally haven't came across a bug yet since I've played. There is many game modes and such and I feel like this is basically another Garry's Mod for the simple fact that you can play it for countless hours and never get bored.
1859	1	a	It's an awesome game! Lacks a few features though. So many mods which make the game more interesting. I recommend playing a COOP mission with your friends since this game does the job of making it as real as possible perfectly.
1861	1	a	First impressions with the game. Download arma 3 check! Play singleplayer passed.. Go to multiplayer check! Find a sandbox server check! Spawn check! Buy a vehicle che....  'Wait a minute... What am i hearing outside of this building?'  Went to the door and as soon as i opened it i saw a frigging tank standing in front of me WITH RAINBOW COLORS!! Didnt have time to close the door and i ran in the other side of the building. I was terrified. I heard that the tank was circling around the building and i had no where to go.  finally i got out of the building and the thank started to chase me so i went back in. I bught uav and had no idea what to do with it. Well apparently i didnt do right thing with it cause i launched a missile while i was on the ground and blow up my uav, my friends uav and 50k helicoper.  After a while my friend came in the same building and he bought uav also. we hopped to the controls of that thing and my friend drove the uav right next to that tank and i launched the missile. Went to see what happened and i saw this tank upside down on the ground. Driver comes out shoots me in the back of my head and then i respawned.  10/10 would play again !
1863	1	a	I played just a bit, pretty good.
1865	1	a	Such graphics Much fun Many guns Can your computer run?
1867	1	a	If you play solo using AI allies against AI enemy this game is a 7/10. BUT with the right mods it quickly becomes an 8/10. Then add in muliplayer, open modding, PVE, PVP, friggin zombies!, a bazillion weapons and equipment, sound packs, then forget that they added gokarts ( I think the devs were on meth the day they came up with that idea ). In my mind you simply cant find any current or past milsim game that can offer anything close to what Arma 3 can.  This isnt your little brothers Call of Duty or Battlefiled, 1 shot can and will kill you thats what the kiddies dont like, but guess what thats real sonny boy.
1869	1	a	All around a good game, I would highly reccomend it to anyone who likes FPS games.
1871	1	a	most realistic water ive seen
1873	1	a	There is something in Arma 3 which will suit your skils, not everyones the same (you will know this if you ever played A2 operration arrowhead) this skill or friendship you have gained by joining group/randomly meeting online will keep you coming back and you will never regret buying this game (unless your an 8 year old FPS swag i know bloody everything cos i play cod â™¥â™¥â™¥)
1875	1	a	This game is one of the best millatary sims i have ever played it is worth its money so go buy this game. Hope you enjoy.
1877	1	a	over all this game rocks excellent graphics and gameplay and if u got arma 3 launcher lots of mods to play,but now at 73.00 dollars not worth it as it was made in 2013 and you gota buy premiun stuff,gear and guns what a joke greedy developers ,maybe wait for steam sale to buy, i got it for 36 dollars and its worth every dollar but wouldnt pay anymore than that.
1879	1	a	If you have a good computer. And you like in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Buy this!
1881	1	a	This game is so good I love to play Simulations especially Military simulators. I might not have alot of hours of ingame time now but im going to be playing this game untill it gets boring.(Which it Doesn't)
1883	1	a	Like most of the reviews of this game on steam, this games first 30 hours will be the most painfull time spent trying to learn the basics. With that in mind, I highly recomend this game to those who played the first two games in the ARMA serise. While the learning curve for the game may take some new players days to learn, it is a game that can not truly be judged by how difficult it can be. When first getting into a game you will realize that the games controls can be extreamly difficult to learn, but upon playing for 30+ hours, you will learn all of the in and outs of the complex controls. Many would be quick to assume that this is just like any ordenary shooter were you run to one objective to the next shooting everything in your path, In ARMA 3 this is simpily not the case. Getting into your first only match you will realize that there will be some situations that may take you 10 minutes of sitting there and waiting for the enemy to make the first move. Needless to say this game is extreamy hardcore, and should be part of your library if you enjoy stratigic games that require communication with other people to win.  What is good: Graphics Gameplay Online Gameplay Community  What Sucks: Learning curve Server-Side lag Large system requirments  My Score- 87/100  -A must buy for those who love stratigic 1st/3rd person shooters.  - 170hrs of playtime at time of review.   
1885	1	a	What can I say other than this game is amazing and one of the best games I've ever had the privilege to play. There are like 20+ different game modes you can play ranging from straight up Round based PVP combat to survival modes and even Role-Play modes. Not only that but there are tons of mods available for the game as well that will add on dozens of hours of playability. I recommend downloading some of the DayZ mods and Battle Royal to start they are amazing!  10/10 Very realistic military simulator with lots of replayability.
1887	1	a	I know a lot of you are probably looking into this game because it's on sale and you have heard a lot about it. The realism, the tactical team based situations, and the wide variety of wepons are amazing! HOWEVER..... I, the mighty Edgar Allan Bro, have a realistic review for this realistic shooter.  In all honesty, Arma 3 is much more a strategy game than it is an FPS. You have to use your team, depending on the gametype, and you have to plan out your offense. For instance, I was in a Sector Control match on Stratis. My squad was given the order to move through a village and take an enemy heald building. So, we all chose a class type. I picked up an LMG, a buddy of mine took a DMR, and the others had assault rifles and SMGs. I was to give covering fire while my men moved up through the building and cleared it out. We were doing great until an LAV rolled up and shot all of our men out of the building. What we failed to do was make sure one of us had an anti tank/infantry launcher.   You MUST make these decisions in this game. I can't stress this enough. The fanbase is INSANE. If you do something wrong, they will call you out on it. I was shot by a team mate, because I didn't clarify my orders once. The game is a great time to play if you have thick skin and you have a group of friends to play with.   The controls can also be VERY overwealimg. every button on your keyboard and mouse has at least two functions.  The game has an â™¥â™¥â™¥ load of mods and an â™¥â™¥â™¥ load of RPG games. It is really a sandbox game when it comes to games revolving around RPG elements.   Now you may think I'm bashing the game, but I did say I recommend it! I do! It's a great game! SC is a lot of fun and it's very very intense. If you don't want this amount of realism, maybe try playing battlefield on origin, or even DOOM if you want an arena based shooter.  I give this game an 8.5/10  The only problems are the straight up noobs â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing up the flow of the combat and the trolls â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing up the flow of the combat. I recommend playing some scenario missions to get the controls and the feel down before jumping into multiplayer. People take this game pretty seriously...  -Edgar Allan Bro
1889	1	a	Great game! Worth it if you can get it on sale!
1891	1	a	Arma 3 is a great millatry simulator it is very in depth and i had a lot of fun with this game! One of the things that was a buying point for me was Altis Life it is a gamemode like cops and roobers where you can do anything from smugle drugs acrros the border to stealing cars or robbing the bank! However The main point that i like the most is how you can acoplish your objective in your own way for the campaign and the multiplayer, you want to go in head first guns balzing you can, you want to go with a stealty helicpoter insercion and some sniper support you can. This is hands down one of the best millitary simulators, and i strongly recomend this game!
1893	1	a	Super fun game worth every penny!
1895	1	a	Great and hooking game that keeps you engaged. If you're looking for a war simulator, you've found it.
1897	1	a	This game/simulator is amazing. You can see all the hardwork that went into creating it. I have been an ARMA Fan since the beginning and enjoy seeing how far it has come.
1899	1	a	Arma 3: Graphics are Better then Arma 2 graphics and look very nice, Sounds are Great and Music is Nice when their is music. I do &amp; don't recommend the game, It's Fun to run around in a cool open world game. But the AI on a lot of Server's are way to Hard to Injoy the game most of the time. The game is great if you have some friend's to hang and chill with you so the game can be a little bit more easyer as long as they are with you. Now down to business Arma 3 is a 7 out of 10
1901	1	a	Oh the hours I've lost to this... and its still just the Alpha.  .... help... me.
1903	1	a	Playing this by yourself and not working together with others this game is quite boring but if you have friends to play with all kinds of fun can be had good game not great but good
1905	1	a	For me is the best game ever &lt;3 !!! Of course i recommend !!! If you play with friends you can add more fun !!!
1907	1	a	Amazing Game, intense graphics and outstanding action packed stratigic gameplay
1909	1	a	this is a game that feels like you're playing something special, up until something actually happens, and then in true bohemia fashion you clip through a building while vaulting or something and die; at which point you close the game because â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1911	1	a	Keeping it real - Bohemia is one of very few developers making games for the PC platform. Besides beeing a very beautiful game, the frenchise is pushing the envelope and bringing you a community game - modable and keeping you, the player, the most important part of the game. On todays games-market, the ArmA experience is like no other. This game is one of the reasons why we still buy Personal Computers - cus' we like to play Personal Games :) Buy it!!
1913	1	a	Arma 3 has come on leaps and bounds since i bought my copy 2 years ago, it just gets better especially with the new apex edition dlc as you get to go to Tanoa and also get to use more vehicles including vtol aircraft. I have 1800 hrs approx in game and 1650 of those hours have been since last july time when i discovered the Exile mod. 10/10 bohemia interactive and keep up the good work
1915	1	a	Probably the best game for serious players who can work together to accomplish the mission.  
1917	1	a	Arma 3 is a brilliant and well made game, It's the best war simulation game out there. The steam workshop mods make it even better.  Awsome game
1919	1	a	the main story can be really hard as it is very realistic so you can die in a few shots. but the mods are SO FUN !  9/10
1921	1	a	Awesome and with so much content it is an amazing military simulator/ straighty game that will be forever epxanding and modding
1923	1	a	My time playing Arma 3    Started game Went on to a Altis life server  Spawned wearing a Hello kitty t-shirt  Dun. 100000/10
1925	1	a	Arma III is definitely, without a doubt, a great game. I have played Arma III mostly with mods such as: Wasteland, Altis Life, and Breaking Point (my favorite). I have also played the Campaign which is also good. There are no other games on Steam that are similar to Arma III (except for the other Arma games ofcourse). Arma III's multiplayer experience is exceptional. The best aspect of Arma III multiplayer , for me, would be the PVP. And that's why I play muliplayer most of the time. My favorite mod for Arma III would be Breaking Point. Breaking Point is very similar to Arma II's DayZ Mod which I have played quite a lot before. If you ever get around to playing Arma III, you should definitely try Breaking Point. Another great multiplayer mode would also be Wasteland. Wasteland doesn't require you to download any seperate files from the internet so it's quick and easy to start playing on. Arma III is full of action, excitement, and adrenaline rushing moments. Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah!!
1927	1	a	The most realistic war simulator ever made. I won't give it a 10/10 because of its bad support for old graphics cards.    9/10
1929	1	a	Most hardcore FPS game ever
1931	1	a	This game amounts to about a half a pile.
1933	1	a	It's good, but the AI needs working on thr AI needs to be more human
1935	1	a	This game is so beautiful it puts a video game to real life. If you're looking for a Military Simulator this is the one beautifully done, great structurely built multiplayer and singleplayer.
1937	1	a	My potato has 2 anuses. 10/10
1939	1	a	when i played this game for free and it was only for two days .My bro and me could not stop play arma 3 wasteland is all we played I highly recommend this game if you are in to big maps first preson shooter best game i ever played in years 
1941	1	a	Best MilSim Sandbox. It's got it's flaws but the positives outweigh by far.  You kinda need some mods to get all the maps back into the game and fight the stupid fatigue system. But in return you get hundrets of hours of gameplay especially if you're with a milsim community.
1943	1	a	Time well spent
1945	1	a	A Game Within A Game FOR SURE. So Much You Can Do! Best Simulation! Altis Life Is VERY Fun. Excellent Game! :D
1947	1	a	this game is everything ive been looking for! been playing nothing but King Of The Hill - but there is so much more to the game I just haven't gotten into the rest of it. many many mods and custom scenaros availble - a very community driven game.  the perfect mix, counterstrike meets battlefield meets call of duty, but very different from all three games, set in a very large open free world with the realism level pretty high. it's a war simulation, so you have to be patient and tactical. if you're running around in the open you will get picked off. if you crash into a tree while you are driving a small vechicle at high speed you will die.   very rewarding game once you get good. you need teamwork and fluid communication. get a headset. get ready to die 25 times before your first kill, and be ready to have no idea where you got shot from :D take cover and keep your eyes open for movement.   a few bugs and glitches here and there but doesn't take away from the game. some issues climbing stairs, weird choppy moments trying to climb over certain objects, noticed a few wall issues too.  very happy with this game so far i hope they keep polishing it   edit: best game i ever played in my life
1949	1	a	Very fun shooter to play with friends and I also love to play altis life!
1951	1	a	Well what can i say about ArmA 3.... It's awesome but also kinda frustrating because its still a ArmA game. It's that kind of game which the the game itself is more dangerous than other player's or AI. We all know THAT pile of garbage or THAT fence that lets us float and after a while you get hammered to the floor with a power of 9000 Newton. All this time you wasted to get there with the specific weapon or whatever is gone. We all need to learn live with it. The best about this game are the Mods that exist. (Exile, Breaking Point, or whatever mods exist) and costum Missions like King of the Hill and Spec ops Operation and Wasteland. There is also the Life mod but i dont care about them sooo... yeah go play it for yourself. I actually dont even remember the Campaign of this Game which is kinda funny since the only thing worth buying this game are the mods. Nobody cares about the Bohemia stuff (the DLC's are another story).   The only problem i have with this game is the performance.  The best thing about this game is the Gameplay/Mods/Map  All time Favourite of mine 7/10 Glitches  Would kÃ®ll myself in rage again
1953	1	a	This game is really what you make of it, So far playing lots of Takistan Life and Exile I can highly reccomend this game. It really is an amazing and unique experience. Youll see thing you wont see in any other games! If you want bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ firefights. Explosions, Car Chases, Or just amazingly cool moments overall then buy this game!
1955	1	a	Arma 3 is a military simulator with 2 islands as the setting, Stratis and Altis, based off of Greek Islands in the Mediterranean. The campaign focuses on the time period of 2035 and follows Kerry, a soldier in NATO stationed in Stratis. Personally I have only gotten halfway through the 3 episode campaign (2nd episode) Arma 3 is much more beautiful and it's obvious a lot of work has been put into graphical detail, though this hindered other key things such as vehicles (Arma 2 has so much more!)   Pros: Looks truly amazing Much higher FPS than Arma 2 Great campaign Clothing choices Mods are easier to get (Steam workshop) Virtual Arsenal allows you to gear up your character for anything and saves a lot of time making your character manually. Crazy stuff is possible even though it's a simulator 3D editor will be coming in the first quarter of 2016 allowing for more scenarios to be made with little to no difficulty (maybe more work though)  Editor allows for many different scenarios such as demolition, sniping, etc DLC content is included in base game though has an annoying ad if not purchased Cons: Editor can still be confusing and scripts are easy to forget Less content than I would have expected though there are attachments for weapons which satisfies those who want high customizability Getting the original maps like Chernarus and Sahrani are in AiA and can be a more complicated process to get than for most Some things seen in game are so unrealistic, see how the hunter will take airtime  In conclusion, Arma 3 is a great game with more content coming and it's easy to get many many hours into the game. Anything is possible and it reminds me of a gmod with military focus. There's tons of potential and I recommend it for anyone who can run it 
1957	1	a	I purchased this for the Epoch mod and only play for that, the mechanics are fantastic and the graphics are incredible. although the game and mod have a ways to go yet, still much fun to be had. Worth every penny... Highly recommend. 
1959	1	a	One of the best games you could possibly play with a good pc. Almost infinite possibilities.
1961	1	a	Arma 3 is PC's best military simulator FPS today. There are more than enough weapons, vehicles, and equipment to keep you busy for atleast 100 hours (not including the community workshop). The community is what makes this game so great. The community workshop offers players a whole new look at Arma 3 (weapons, vehicles, equipment, maps, scenarios). There is no doubt that Arma 3 is going to be around for a long time. If you love military simulators, this game is for you. 500 hours well spent.
1963	1	a	  this game its awesome with friends
1965	1	a	If you were to buy this game today, with no DLC or Mods, or anything of the sort, you can easily get hudreds of hours of enjoyable playtime. That's all with just Vanilla Arma. You see, the thing is though, this game has never been about the vanilla experience. This game is about experimenting with new mods and joining a community and experiecing some of the best virtual days of your life with the person to your left and to your right. Alone, this game is amazing, but with the millions of free mods? Priceless.
1967	1	a	This game will test your computer's CPU. But feels like a good game, until I get off it, then I notice...I haven't done anything in the game. lol
1969	1	a	Best mil-sim shooter out in the market. Honest review of ARMA 3 in the video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh3webkCo4Y 
1971	1	a	I recommend being sniped from 800m by 'Mr Yung' and then being told to suck it
1973	1	a	A very realistic military game.... The life mods are fun too...
1975	1	a	This game is hard core with many game modes that give me the chance to express my interest and special needs.This game will only get better with time like aged chesse or a fine wine....
1977	1	a	great game well worth it
1979	1	a	Arma3, aside of being a Military simulator, it's a team based play. Out of the 1500hrs I have on record roughly 1400hrs of that has been with the same team... where people have laughed, cried, thrown frags instead of smokes, crashed and survived, crashed and not survived,   Together we have killed russians, talibans, CSAT, tanks, planes, more russians and sometimes when people are not looking the medic.... we have fought together and most importantly, we have walked together.  The adventures you get to do with the team of your choosing will never be forgotten, mostly because they're on twich or youtube...  All in all, play arma, get a good team and enjoy the life of a grunt
1981	1	a	This is my first review. Arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim you'll play in awhile. The realism beats battlefield, but is slower. At first if you're not use to it you will wonder how you died. After awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. ARMA 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.The game has many positives and some negatives that I can note.  Positives: + Amazing graphics in some places + Big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +A decent amount of vehicles / weapons  +Alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + A very good editor and a real time edior named zeus (now 3D) + Life like situations with other players + No annoying kids like in Call Of Duty Negatives: - The campaign does leave an impression - The AI downright has no IQ - Needs a good computer - The map ,though big, some places is really just open land (unless is apex then trees everywhere) - Hard to learn The game has it's shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game you've ever played. Don't buy this game if you won't take the time to learn how to play. That is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like Call of Duty.
1983	1	a	played a few hours and done nothing in a server of day z mod. but at school all i was think bout was this game im addicted to it help me.  good game, ez to get into ,fun, addictive and want to play it all the time but cant because of school   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u school and let me play arma 3 and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me grades
1985	1	a	10/10
1987	1	a	Very good game once you learn it! So many gamemodes to try!
1989	1	a	A great game if you like sandbox milsims. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a new game. It is being constantly updated, and it's totally worth a try.
1991	1	a	I love this game ^_^
1993	1	a	ArmA 3 is Bohemia Interactive's Military Simulation game released in late 2013 and a successor to their acclaimed ArmA 2 released back in mid 2009. The reason I'm reccommending this game is because of it's playability on a grand scale. I started playing it back in early 2014 And since then, I'm still discovering new ways to play this game, and still loving the old a great ones. But I'll go through some pros and cons. So it's not totally biased.  Pros:  Grand Scale Warfare. If you're just recently coming from a game like Battlefield or CoD or any other FPS war game looking for something more big, or you're just wanting a big realistic map to drive a tank around, this is for you! ArmA 3 comes out of the box with a 270 km2 mediterrainian map named 'Altis' with everything from hills, towns, airports and military bases, based off the real island 'Lemnos' in the middle of the mediterrainian sea. It also comes with it's sister island, much smaller in size, clocking in around 20 km2 named 'Stratis'. And their buyable DLC 'Apex' which comes with their Pacific jungle terrain at about 100 km2. There is something for everyone, and the grand scale in a game with the ratio of detail is unmatched.  Realistic Bullet Physics. In A3 bullets act how they're supposed too. Trying to shoot a sniper zero'd in at 600 metres and a man 200 metres away is likely not going to hit, but go over his head. So naturally having the correct range is key. Bullets have proper peneration with a 45 .ACP round not penerating a wall decently, in comparison to a 7.62 round flying through it. The bullets follow proper drop like you'd expect, and they even have rebounding! (Oh the times I've trolled my friends firing at their feet, it rebounding and killing them...Woopsie).  Awesome vehicles. The use of Tanks and aircraft is just amazing, they have a good range of all kinds of vehicle types. From civilian trucks and offroads, to NATO tanks and a artillery truck that looks like a mobile SAM turrent. And the jets that make you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your pants when they buzz you and they're not your team.  Sandbox Style Game. This is probably the biggest part of A3, and it's the pure creativity of the community. With the use of a workshop and mod support. And the ability to simply create missions and upload them to the workshop. This game stretches out from all the things I mentioned and becomes a really good game. I believe mods help games blossom and shoudn't be used to reflect on the game in a negative way.  Cons:  Clunky. Although the game is a mil sim, the game can get really clunky. From odd movements and annoying vaulting animations, this game can get really irritating when you're running for you life with a hail mary of bullets behind you, and you're sprinting to vault over a fence, and your character lazily vaults over it, like you're taking a nice casual stroll. It can really make you want to throw your keyboard.  Bulls*** AI: The AI can be challenging and fun a lot of the time. But sometimes, they can be bloody irriating. The fact that they can work out the exact area to shoot you in the head from 300 metres after firing two rounds can really get on your nerves. And this is apparent to newer players. The learning curves on how to take AI out efficently can be annoying, but sticking with it can help, although it shouldn't really be like 'Sticking with it', the AI should just be decent ;)  Overpriced DLC. Now ultimately I can't say sh**, as I own all of them, but the DLC are way too overpriced for what they actually are. Helicopters gives you two Helis and the ability to sling load vehicles in a Huron for 12.00 USD, Marksman which I didn't mind paying as much for as it gives you seven new weapons that can be used for long range, including new scopes, better Ghillie suits and a remote laser designator. Is a little bit more bang for you buck, unlike the one I mentioned above. And Karts is kind of useless unless you feel like being a go-kart master and thank god only costs 2.00 USD. Probably the most expensive and the most debated on weither it's worth it's rather big price tag is Apex, including the Tanoa map I mentioned above, clocking in at about 35.00 USD, which is kind of horrible considering ArmA 3 itself is about 40.00 USD, five dollars above the DLC. Alright, I won't mention any more about the DLC.  Bad optimzation.  Now before people say 'Get a better PC Scrub'. I do have a fairly average PC, but I'm not getting at that. The game has been known for it's rather â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ optimization, and the fact it is 32 bit, it's not fully using the memory efficiently. The game has been known to run at like 40 frames for people with really good PC's, and although it was a huge improvement from A2, it still needs more work, hopefully they can fix this in the upcoming months.  Bugs. Need I say more? Bugs are irritating as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, although not as common as back in 2014, some are still there, and can be really annoying.  Anyway, that's my summary of ArmA 3, feel free to debate any of the topics with me, I'm more than welcome. Thanks for reading this far, I appreciate it. All and all, ArmA 3 is a must have for PC gamers, due to it's massive community and it's creative elements, that truly turn this from a good game, to a great game.  cheers!
1995	1	a	already running it better than arma 2.
1997	1	a	Very good game. I play it almost every day and I never get bored. Best way to describe it is a foundation for mod creators and developers to make new missions and gamemodes. I'm in a semi-milsim group called Section  7.(http://www.s7-gaming.com) . I also stay in the life mod scene as well as player made missions and scenarios. If you have the money and the short time it takes to learn the mechanics you will have a blast! 10/10
1999	1	a	This my first ever game review so, I'll try my best. Basically, what you get with ARMA is open-world warfare. The size of the maps and locations in ARMA bring it to life more than a simple Call Of Duty Map. The graphics are beautiful and show off the true extent of PC Gaming, Simple things such as the movement of smoke whilst flying through it with a helicopter or jet pay off big time. There is a huge extent of weapons and vehicles to choose from to explore the vast world. Multiplayer is fantastic with there being many 'Altis-Life' servers out there such as EUGL or Darkside Gaming. These online servers give you the oppurtunity to make it big as a drug smuggler or serve Altis in the Police Forces and work your way to higher positons. My only let downs with the game is the driving/flying/boating physics and controls. It definately isn't the best game when it comes to vehicles with the steering feeling delayed and sloppy and the damage can be sometimes, ridiculous. There was a time where I drove a vehilce into a tree at around 10 km/h and it blew up. Then another where I crashed a heli out of the sky and everything was fine besides the rotors.   So to sum up the game, if you are looking for an open-world warfare with a great multiplayer community you should definately give it a go, Even though I have never played this as a single-player game it still gets an Easy 8/10 from me.\\  -HDWizzard
2001	1	a	Do yourself a favour... Buy this game
2003	1	a	really good game, needs a beafy pc though if you want it to look nice 
2005	1	a	Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.
2007	1	a	Arma III is a gorgeous, detailed military simulation that in it's own way makes you feel like a warrior.  8/10
2009	1	a	Amazing Game if you are apart of a mil-sim (160th-SOR) good campaign, great range of mods and Multiplayer servers and game modes.
2011	1	a	This game is amazing. Straight up; no ifs, ands or buts about it. It does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles, for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to ARMA2 but this will likely change over the course of the game's life as BI is releasing new content in sections like the campaign. Then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over :).  If you're at all into Milsim or Hardcore FPS games you're probably going to love this. The game's biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want with it. You want to drive into the target area with a sub, swim to shore and rise out of the water like a Navy S.E.A.L? You can do that. Want to fly in in an AH-6 loaded for bear? You can do that. Want to fly a jet? Drive a tank? Skydive in? Attack at night? Use a mortar? Be a sniper? Fly an attack heli? Or just go in as a rifleman? ARMA 3's got you covered. It's as advertised...the ultimate military sandbox. Probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity.
2013	1	a	this game is for real gamers :)
2015	1	a	Must BUY this game.
2017	1	a	best game if your in to realistic action game
2019	1	a	This game is just pure awesome. Minutes can turn into hours just like that, very addictive. Just awesome!
2021	1	a	This game is very Hyper-Realistic.
2023	1	a	The only game that I'm willing to play on 30 fps with constant drops.
2025	1	a	Great game I love playing this with my friends really good graphics and good guns i would reconmend this game to your friends
2027	1	a	The most strategic F.P.S game i have ever played. I love the game because it is filled with hard campain missions and an amazing multiplayer
2029	1	a	The amount of hours I have invested in this game should say it all. 10/10
2031	1	a	Walking down the street, suddenley a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tank appears next thing i know i'm lying in a bush bleeding out hearing some 10 year old shout allahu akbar 10/10 would get destroyed by a child soldier again
2033	1	a	This game is bloody spectacular though one issue I have is the fact that with an i5 6500, GTX 1060 and 8GB of RAM I can't push above 60fps at all times and lowering settings does not change anything, I assume this to be a CPU bottleneck due to it having to render a very large map. Anyway game is great no matter what but hopefully in the future there will be a patch to further optimise performance.
2035	1	a	Arma 3 is probebly the most realistic and tacticle fps on the market. (exept for the ground vehicle physics lol)
2037	1	a	Fantastic game, from casual to hardcore sim this game can and will fit your needs in a game.  Only thing i dislike about the game is the price of the DLC
2039	1	a	Arma 3 is one of THE BEST games that was released. Although it has some issues at times. its still a VERY GOOD game.   My only flaw would be that is is NOT optimized well enough, which is a shame, they could of made it so much better,   Anyway if you enjoy shooting people, Roleplay, Teamwork or having fun in general then this is the game for you!
2041	1	a	A huge step up from previous ARMA titles, graphically and mechanics wise. A3 has addressed nearly all the features I wanted added to increase immersion and to make the game a bit more fluid.  Although set in the 2030's, A3 retains its grounding in realism and all the military equipment in this game exists or could exist in 2013 .  Pick it up early to save yourself about $20 before the games full release.
2043	1	a	I purchased Arma 3 when it was in Alpha. I have more time in Arma 3 than any other game in my library, at just under 1300 hours, aka, about 53 days. I imagine that with these stats alone, I'd have a good idea of what the game has to offer.  Arma 3 is of course the pinacle of the series so far, with new Tech, massive maps, and a solid founding based in years of experience. With the release of APEX, my love for this game has only increased. I found the Coop campaign to be fresh, if not a little short. My major concern with this game, is it's timeline. I hate futuristic crap, the guns feel fake, and the vehicles are boring.  Thankfully, Arma has enjoyed one of the best modding communities in online gaming. With teams like RHS, and the guys behind ACE, the futuristc crapshoot that was Arma, suddenly becomes a modern conflict with amazing scale. With groups like Shacktac putting out constant content, there's something for everyone.   Arma 3's greatest strength is by far it's community. From Milsim Units like 7CAV, to private servers hosting the Iron Front 1944 Mod, to King of the Hill, there is always someone online ready to throw down with you.  Fantastic Game. By Far my Favorite PC Game Ever. 10/10.
2045	1	a	I've ran more miles in this game than I have in real life.
2047	1	a	I Got arma 3 on sale with the dlcs and crap, loaded up the game and selected Koth (king of the hill) i played for a while and really enjoyed myself a bit later in the game i got a sniper, a ghille i was set for some sniping! went to a very popular sniper location on tanou where this log, i came to figure out could glitch you into the ground if you put your bipod on it.  I abused this alot -(sorry)  i got killed by some guy named Dan who sneaked up behind me, and watched him pick up my rifle so i knew he was going to snipe aswell so, i went back to the log and did the bipod glitch and fired 2 shots into the air so Dan, will comeback. He ended up coming back! and he brought is freind who which, i went into direct communitation and started to make wierd sounds ie -(snorting, yelling, schreeching) and he and his freind 1)shot the ground 2)threw grenades at me 3) told me to get out. i didnt, and while they where trying to kill me 2 other snipers came along and found these guys shooting at the ground, to which they murderd both Dan and his freind right about now i had fallen over laughing and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ myself, while the two snipers tea-baged Dan's dead body (rip Dan) so after there tea-baging they wanted to snipe now, these snipers didnt know about this 'glitch' and had layed to the left and right of me so, i started to make wierd noises again scaring the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of them, and while they layed there they started to try to use the bipod and got the same glitch i was in, and they soon realized that i was lying beside them so, they started to shoot the ground throw grenades and blah blah blah well, other snipers from MY team found them, and killed one of them, and the other sniper 360 noscoped one of them (no lie it was amazing) and while they where distracted i poped up out of the ground and shot 7 rounds of 9mm into his chest to which he shot me in the face with a .307. i then fellback and started to laugh very loudly and started to cry from laughing so hard and my window was open so the whole neighborhood heard me, snorting, yelling , laughing and schreehing at 1am. Arma3 best game 10/10
2049	1	a	you can kill people without knowing anything about them and you still do it because you're a mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing American
2051	1	a	Attention: I am NOT reviewing Arma 3 solo play. I am reviewing the online multiplayer in Altis Life and Asylum.. First of all, let me just say that a majority of the people I've come across in this game are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. They'll kill you, take your stuff, harrass you, etc; all while you have your back turned. HOWEVER.. the rest of the gameplay makes up for it. This is one of those games where you need friends. Don't have friends? Make some. It is so unbelieveably easy to make friends in this game and at that point you can actually have a promising team to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ done. You WILL NOT succeed on your own. Sorry, if you're a solo player, you're gunna need a team at some point. Altis Life is a game mode. It's fun, and there's no limit to what you can actually do. Be a cop - Check. Be a rebel - Check. Be a taxi driver - Check. Be a paramedic - Check.  I love this game for the time I've played and I recommend it to anyone who's willing to die over and over, to eventually succeed.
2053	1	a	I've ran more miles in this game than I have in real life.
2055	1	a	words can't describe how much i love this game  ARMA IS LOVE ARMA IS LIFE
2057	1	a	I Got arma 3 on sale with the dlcs and crap, loaded up the game and selected Koth (king of the hill) i played for a while and really enjoyed myself a bit later in the game i got a sniper, a ghille i was set for some sniping! went to a very popular sniper location on tanou where this log, i came to figure out could glitch you into the ground if you put your bipod on it.

Arma3 best game 10/10
2059	1	a	A mostly incomplete yet incredibly addictive and detailed sandbox that takes 'playing army' to an entirely new level.
127	0	a	Poorly Optimised
2061	1	a	This game rocks... if you like hardcore fps games, you canÂ´t miss this one. Also LOTS OF COMMUNITY MODS!!! I bought apex pack at 50% christmas, now 70 dlrs, is a bit salty, but its worth totally. Salutes from Argentina! PD: Battle Royale kicks a s s hard!!
2063	1	a	Awesome game   Great phyics and good preformance huge multiplayer + point . Alot of awesome mods eg exile and king of the hill and armageddon i recommend this game totaly worth the money , amazing game money well spent
2065	1	a	Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale!  Arma IIIâ€™s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once youâ€™re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, youâ€™re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat thatâ€™s simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable, making Arma IIIâ€™s nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know thereâ€™s a long, dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light.
2067	1	a	A game crafted with love and care - A good game!  I really love to play this game, Â´cause you have so many opportunities to play this game - Its f*cking awsome!  You need to get that game!  Totally worth it! 
2069	1	a	Awesome game   Great phyics and good preformance huge multiplayer + point . Alot of awesome mods eg exile and king of the hill and armageddon i recommend this game totaly worth the money , amazing game money well spent
2071	1	a	Good game! The vanilla game on its own is quite nice but with the rapidly growing modding and mission making community it makes this game so much better! Definitely recommend!
2073	1	a	Got in a submarine, found Crush. Still finding Nemo.
2075	1	a	dis gam is vri gr8 i r8 9/10 ign not as good as a2 HAIL MASTER GOAT
2077	1	a	Run over a police officer for a ticket  10/10
2079	1	a	This game is really beautiful on Max Settings. Even on low settngs, the game is still visually impressive.The gameplay also is very good and smooth, especially when you jump down some stairs and appear on the roof of a building!  10/10
2081	1	a	Best game in the world for me ATM.
2083	1	a	one of the best games ever.  u need time to learn how to play and more to master.  the best mods are wasteland and altis life and its keep updating by community.  there's more mods like breaking point and epoch wich is like dayz.   9/10

2089	1	a	Killed 15 players with my bomb vest, now i'm surrounded by 72 virgins (30 year old wizards and not models) in heaven. 9/11 would ISIS again.
2091	1	a	It's OK, I guess.
2093	1	a	Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.  The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2 . Altis , a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves.   Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands.  A half-year in paid pre-release has given Arma 3 time to gestate, but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series, and some long-standing blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger. Even on high-end hardware, my framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions. Friendly AI units, though marginally better-behaved, still depend on the player to be their brains, an issue that's circumvented by playing Arma the way God intended it: cooperatively.   With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized.  Dumping the APC is the only option. We clump into the fragile HEMTT, burning diesel to get off the exposed ridge. Green tracers track the truck, eventually pricking some of my tires. The wheels don't deflate enough to go flat, but the suspension slumps to the left. For the rest of the mission I have to drive lopsided, constantly counter-steering just to keep the truck on the gravel road. But everyone works together to keep our war bus on track--my teammates give turn instructions, read the map, and scan the road for more mines.  When we're free of immediate danger, we send someone back to base to retrieve an ATV so that we have a forward scouting element. At one point we position two machinegunners with nightvision scopes at the lip of a valley to provide cover as we drive the HEMTT down an exposed valley, then taxi them back to us on the ATV. The sequence of events, the chatter, the wounds and kills we rack up, all developed because we happened to run over a mine and our tires got shot up.   Getting flexible  Arma's capacity for stimulating camaraderie, atmosphere, and problem-solving, in other words, is fully intact. The feeling of ownership that arises over these moments between you and your squadmates sticks in your brain. Central to this fun is how malleable Arma continues to be for its community, which before launch day had published almost 1,500 missions to Steam Workshop . Assuming you have an internet connection, this well of content compensates for the absence of an official campaign at launch, which will integrate in three free monthly installments beginning in October.  On the ground, a new stance adjustments system is the best thing that's ever happened to infantry combat in Arma. Holding the Ctrl key as a modifier while tapping W or S cycles between nine vertical stances, and you can also take a horizontal step in addition to using Q or E to lean. You feel articulate--making small body adjustments while behind cover initially feels like finger gymnastics, but the system makes more types of cover viable and more types of weapons viable in that cover. Coupled with the general smoothing of movement and the near elimination of Arma 2's uninterruptible, sluggish animations, running and gunning should finally feel comfortable to average FPS players.  On the opposite end of your gun, though, AI remains a shortcoming. Arma 3's enemies share plenty of their ancestors' DNA, which means that they oscillate between being eagle-eyed snipers at one moment and static, dumb, 3D silhouettes evocative of a light gun arcade game another. Their greatest flaw is that they lack personality, which mostly resigns them to being targets rather than soldiers.   A few sparks of intelligence did impress me--after we killed the rest of his squadmates, I watched a rifleman flee for the first time in Arma, setting up a tense shot where I had a narrow few seconds to snipe him in the back before he disappeared behind trees. This is the sort of human behavior I'd love to see more of, stuff like blind-firing, limping, throwing smoke grenades for cover, claiming abandoned vehicles, or looting bodies for supplies--anything that would lessen the predictability.  Friendly AI is even worse, unfortunately, because they're typically your responsibility. It's absurd that my squad's medic won't patch me up when I'm bleeding right next to him unless I order him to. Pathfinding isn't reliable, either: I spent five minutes repeating the â€œMove toâ€¦â€ and â€œGet in vehicleâ€ commands, trying to convince a freed hostage and my squadmate to cross the map so we could finish the mission. They wouldn't budge. The crux of the issue is Arma's mile-long command menu, which scatters dozens of commands across all 10 numerical keys. Like the enemy AI, though, there are glimpses of authentic behavior. I felt like a proud parent when my AI fireteam, unprompted, broke formation and spread themselves behind cover during a raid on a cluttered factory.   Breaking formation  Bohemia's graphical improvements are substantial enough to make Arma 3 one of the most visually impressive games on any platform. Altis (and its little-brother island Stratis) are rendered with incredible clarity, illuminated by lighting that produces pink sunsets, blinding solar glare, and golden afternoons. I love the way the earth feels textured as you jog and crawl through it--gravel, sand, and grass all emit different sounds under your boots.  I'm mostly happy with the graphical performance I've been getting on the three configurations I've been playing Arma 3 on. The caveat being that my framerate varies based on where I am on the map, the number of objects and enemies, and if I'm playing online. On a Core-i7 X990 at 3.47 GHz and two AMD Radeon 5970s on Very High settings, I've gotten 17-25 FPS on one single-player mission and 40-50 on another. Multiplayer is where I found the least-consistent performance. On a Core-i7 870 and GTX 780, I can get 55 FPS in a tight, six-player scenario on Very High, but 20 in a large-format mission like Wasteland .  Tinkering with Arma 3's 25 configurable video settings allowed me to improve these numbers a little, but even dialing down the quality to standard or low on my rigs barely helped while playing large multiplayer missions. The scripting or complexity of some scenarios simply seems to bottleneck performance regardless of your settings. Some specific actions also consistently produced framerate dips for me, (Sorry ran out of words)
2095	1	a	As close to the real action as you can get! One of my best expeirences: I was playing KOTH (SC). My team and I were holding down a building under heavy fire. I ran out of ammo and was yelling to my teammates for any extra mags while our building was being peppered. A team mate dropped me some ammo and he said 'make em count thats all I have'. The rest of my teammates in the building were running low on ammo as well and the enemies were closing in. We called for someone to bring a hellicopter from out base to extract us and bring us back to base so we can rearm. Then some one said 'hold on guys im on my way!' After a few minutes our ammo was dangerously low and we hear our chopper coming. I saw him drop off 5 other players who immidiatly engaged the other team. 'ok go go go!' yells one of my teammates. We all ran out of the tower in a crouched sprint towards the chopper with bullets flying everywhere. I finally made my way to the helle safe as well as my other treamates. Whiule watching everyone run to the chopper i see two of my teammates get dropped. One just yelled 'dont worry about me just go!' The back of the chopper closed and we took off headed back to base to rearm. NO OTHER VIDEO GAME CAN PUT YOU UNDER THAT MUCH STRESS! And I loved every second of it! Truely the type of shooter (sorry...MILSIM) that ive always wanted! See you on the battlefield!
2097	1	a	  .
2099	1	a	that feel when you spend $60 on arma 3 then it comes on sale and costs $20 next day
2101	1	a	the beast :D
2103	1	a	Huge maps, amazing graphics, smooth performance, great gameplay... If you're looking for a MilSim or slow paced shooter, than this is the game for you.
2105	1	a	This game is horribly unoptimized, very buggy, and just plain doesn't work sometimes. Most MP servers are garbage and lag like hell, the single player campain isn't very good, and the vanilla game isn't worth anything near 60$.  Think of Arma 3 as a foundation for things to be built on top of. This game gets SO much better with mods and other addons.  This game is without a doubt the best military simulator out right now, and it gets many times better if you play with a group of people.  It has pretty much infinite replayability and more things to do than you'll ever be able to. It just has so much to offer and experience. I've found that playing with a group of people in Arma 3 is an amazing experience that no other shooter can offer.   Arma 3 really is the ultimate sandbox in which the possibilites are endless.   If you can overlook it's flaws and get over them, you'll find Arma 3 to be one of the best games you've ever played.
2107	1	a	Very fun game to play with some friends :D
2109	1	a	10/10 Wish I could afford this game.
2111	1	a	Its dam good game very realistic! 9/10
2113	1	a	it's good
2115	1	a	In this game, you're not the hero anymore. Instead, you are the one getting shot by the hero.
2117	1	a	So far it's alright, but I still need a bit more time before deciding on how good it actually is.
2119	1	a	I played the game at free weekend and i find it very good but even more promising. The graphics are breathtaking while the gameplay, in my opinion, can imrove a bit. I loved the greek setting, it reminds me of my vacations. The bad thing is that the free weekend is over and now I can't afford to buy the full game...Anyone offering it as a gift? :)
2121	1	a	Great Game
2123	1	a	I Â´m going to be honest, It isnÂ´t such good as arma 2. Despite better optimization,graphic and Zeus ( zeus is really good but its hard to use unofficial addons to run zeus correctly) is more drawbacks what i have to say. It wasn't fell like arma anymore, but like CoD or BF, unreal weapons(ammo, units, vehicles), body armor system ( the biggest problem at all in my opinion , it was probably mented like good think, but if you shoot soldier twice in chest, he cannot be able to return fire, ok, he MAY survive but that should be all). Positive think is FREE bootcamp ( but it doesn't fully support addons) what is sad... virtual arsenal loadouts re not able ti share in zeus. (when I said is positive, it was because its free, what is not common in nowadays). But you can as normal add addons and mods in arma, what makes it playable again. In result : Arma 3 is worth to buy for common player only because Zeus, nothing more have any value. If you re arma enthusiast (like me) and you are going to play arma 3 with mods and addons its good improvement after arma 2 (more support, more mod and addon makers, bigger maps). 
2125	1	a	This game is one of the most polished bohiema interactive games  i will write this review in catgorieys i hope you agree with me  Gameplay - SinglePlayer 3 - 5   The singleplayer is ok the campaign was not as good as the others and that is why i give it a 3 out of a 5 as i would not  replay this campaign   Content - Vanilla 2 - 5   in arma 3 Vanilla the content is pritty much recycled for examples there are like 10 varients of a MX rifle and not many default vechicles and thats why i would rate Content for the Vanilla 2 out of 5  Content - Add-ons 5-5   The main thing about arma is that the DLC is made by mostly the communtiy aka Free - Addons you can get addons that add more weapons, more Vehicles, More Infentry and MUCH MORE!!!! making the addons for content a perfect 5   Vehicles - Handling and Models 4-5   The Vehicle play in arma aka handling is not really that good but the Models are amazing and have had alot of hard work put in them making this catgory a 4   Mission Editor - aka the editor that allows people to make a misson 5 - 5  The Mission editor is spectacular in arma 3 and should allway be used want to make a halo dive misson you can make it want to make a infiltration mission you can do it want to make a stealth misson you can do it making a perfect 5  Overall 9 - 10   Arma 3 is deffintly worth a buy i would recomend it if you are a hardcore fan of arma 2 the addons add huge amounts of replability i hope you get this game and enjoy it the Multiplayer gets a 5-5 since its so amazing i would reccomed this game to anyone who is a fan of Arma games
2127	1	a	This Game Wasn't For me But however it seems like a good game and it's Optimized greatly.
2129	1	a	a little hard to get use to and takes alot of skill, but is the game of which I have spent the most amount of time on and never get bored of due to the completely dynamic multiplayer and community made missions and mods. This game is truly a hell of an experiance and I personally recommend it especially to persons who may be either interested or are already in the millitary
2131	1	a	This is a really really great game and worth every penny, very enjoyable with friends.
2133	1	a	This is a damn good and realistic game. Very good war simulator and graphics are awesomeness when they are at high and when graphics are set to ultra or better they are fantastic! This is one of the best games I have played!
2135	1	a	10/10
2137	1	a	this game is the best game ever
2139	1	a	one of the best gaems
2141	1	a	This is a must have for any realism, strategy, or FPS player. I strongly recommend it to everyone!
2143	1	a	ArmA 3 feels like, ArmA. Good,fun and kept the ArmA 2 feeling very well. No more need to be said. 
2145	1	a	Super fun to play with friends. Would definately recommend.
2147	1	a	I rate this game 2 raisons
2149	1	a	This game is the only game I could replay for years. AI is very limited, still improved in the past updates. I think if Bohemia create another AI that fits their game, well probably the best war game ever made.
2151	1	a	This a MAJOR improvement of the last Arma game. Graphics are better and the physics. I wish the damage system was a bit updated but no matter, Its so much fun with 2 massive islands to explore :D Don't waste $$$ on MW or BF... get ARMA.  Lasting Appeal - 8.5 Graphics - 9.5 Sound - 10 Gameplay - 10 
2153	1	a	With only 168.4 hours played I would have to say that Arma 3 is one of the best military shooters I have ever played in my entire life. Love playing steam games with friends and want a military shooter this is the absolute game for you. Arma 3 has an amazing community and amazing addons to go with it like Battle Royale, Epoch, Breaking point and many other addons that make the game endless fun for you and your friends.
2155	1	a	its a great game
2157	1	a	So many glitches and bugs.... you need to play just cause of that. It makes you rofl a lot.    Great Sim with sometimes funny Physics :D seriously... Never had such fun in a shooter since BF2...  Arma3 is much more tactical tho. Very addicting and challenging game which is still getting updates and bugfixes plus a great DLC incoming soon with free Updates included for non DLC owners.  Apex Update: Great Expansion with a really lovely created new map. The included Engine Upgrade for normal and DLCÂ´s clients is very nice. Still can recommend this game a lot... If you have some friends to play with this is really a great Tactical Sim with a lot of fun, action and very very special moments. ;D
2159	1	a	Look at the amount of hours I have played and guess if I recommend it.  Good: Military realism Large map Can't run and gun like COD Almost everything about the game You can be/do pretty much anything in this game. Even a stupid mod that's highly popular called Atlis Life where you.. well... live life as an avatar.  Graphics are always a plus, if your computer can run it.  Bad: Even after a year of full release, it still has glitches. Fatigue system is a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥, but realistic(ish)  It's plain and simple. If you love a legitimate military tactics, movement, feel over all, then this game is for you. The modding community is over the top and will release content for this till arma 5 comes out. (Notice I skipped arma 4, that's how dedicated people are to these games). If you like running and gunning.... you'll rage quit within the first day.  Highly recommended. Join us on EUTW 
2161	1	a	I am very recommend this game , super realistic with the new update 10/10 - Gameplay 
2163	1	a	Best roleplaying game!
2165	1	a	Best Game I have ever played! the game is great but there is a slight problem with lag issues but other than that this game is spectaculer when you play with friends. I recommend this to anyone who has a good computer and is looking to buy this game!
2167	1	a	+1 plus one for me great game when it comes to the mods... my heart has never jumped out of my chest from pvp in a long time...
2169	1	a	very nice game lots of weapons maps based in greek islands but if you dont have a friend to play with dont buy it and also very nice edditor mode where you can make yor own missions
2171	1	a	Lots of missions, mods, and content. Much more, its Arma :P just beware your typical arma glitches but my favorite games to play. Too much for me to say why its good.
2173	1	a	the price is to high 
2175	1	a	A really nice game. If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. The best thing about Arma 3 is creating your mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with someone else of maybe even a server. One of the best gamemodes everyone shuold try if you get the game is Atlis Life which is a roleplay gamemode. I played over 1000 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game, most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i meet in game. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend!
2177	1	a	The level of fun and excitement I've had playing this game has not diminished a single bit since the day I first played it back in it's alpha stage 10/10.
2179	1	a	(Note: This review is based mostly upon the playing of 'King Of The Hill' type gamemodes within the Arma 3 game.)  So, Arma 3 ... where to start?  Well, this game isn't an arcade shooter. I'm sure plenty of other reviewers have already covered the distinction between 'BF4/CoD/Arma 3' and so I won't touch that subject other than to point you toward other reviewers. This isn't an arcade shooter. This is a military simulator. There is a bit of a difference.  You can't jump in this game. You can vault. Seriously, ever tried to jump with a full combat harness and loads of gear on? And carrying a weapon?   What you will get from this game:  Intense, team-oriented gameplay that strives to put emphasis on realism and the communication factor of warfare.  The real feeling of value for mechanized units in war, and the pride and punishment of victory or defeat. A sense of patience when engaging in a battle, such that you will never really get from another first person combat game, because sometimes you just have to out-think your enemy rather than out-gun them in Arma 3. Intense firefights and vehicular combat. Most of all, a sense of enjoyment and fun.  What you will NOT get from this game:  Jumping. Infinite sprinting and dead-aim accuracy. Single-seat tanks/armor/mechanized infantry vehicles that let you blaze through a town driving and gunning at the same time. (It takes a crew to utilize a vehicle properly in Arma 3) Over-the-top cinematic-style wholescale destruction. Quick rounds/matches that are over in 10 minutes. Easy-To-Fly Jets/Helicopters.  Should you try this game? Maybe. That depends on if you want a game that gives you instantaneous, short-lived action. If you want that, you probably shouldn't play this game. If you want a game that immerses you for hours on end and makes you forget about that pot of chili you left on the stove a few hours ago and is now ruined, leaving you to order takeout because YOU'VE GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT STREET AND GIVE MEIDCAL AID/REPAIR THAT VEHICLE before the enemy launches another RPG at your squadmates, then yes. Get this game. You'll probably love it.  Now get back into the fight.
2181	1	a	Bohemia really knows how to create a war simulation game, I have no idea how did they get a game to run smoothly on a bad computer. Good job, BEST OF 2013!
2183	1	a	Arma 3 is probably the most fun I've had in a long time. Singleplayer is ok but scenarios from the workshop are really fun. Most of my time is spent playing the Wasteland mod. I recommend you all try it out cause it can get insanely fun with a group of friends all teamed up in one server.
2185	1	a	I've only played Breaking Point. But that mod alone is worth the price of the game.  I'm sure games before it like day z had the looting system and the loss of all items once killed. But since those games seemed broken or full of toxic players I never got into them.   You can either choose to move methodically to try and survive and keep your hours of work. Or just run and gun and enjoy your 15 minutes of life.  There's nothing like laying on a roof for 3 hours only to kill 2 people. Sorry, guys. It's you or me.  The only downside I've found in my 20 or so hours is how broken the melee system is. Also the lack of zombies. There's like 3 zombies per town.
2187	1	a	+ Amazing Gameplay + Endless User Content and an inbuilt editor +Great community +Very nice graphics +Constant platform updates/DLC with plans for an expansion in future +Infinite replayability +Things for everyone, EG KOTH for casual users to full MilSim   -Quite graphically intensive -ArmA controls
2189	1	a	Extremely Fun and has a diverse amount of different game modes 
2191	1	a	Ok time for me to get around to this.   At first, Coming from ARMA 2 vet, it was quite confusing to play seeing how control are tad bit different. However I quickly learned it was for good. You no longer need to scroll and select action menu. For simple item, you can just enter boxes, open door, pick up item just one click away. For complicated stuff, action menu is there for you. But remmeber, do use mousewheel select or you'll shoot instead. Haha. Also Gears are now Inventory. So thats I not G because G will drop a nade and kill you.   Now for the game. I personally disliked the future theme it had going on. However, Thankful for Armaholic and super easy new mod system. I was able to mod the game back to current year. Not 2035. I recommend getting a faction addon such as Canadian Force or Us Infantry with NATO - Spetsnaz Weapon Pack. They will make the game MORE better. Now I am making scenario like madman and playing it. Love how you can customize weapon, love how you can select gears and helmet to use. (Grass Helmet for the win)   Vanilla 4/10   with Mods 20/10   Also you dont need to wear pant or condom to play this.
2193	1	a	Well, Arma 3, Arma 3. Personally this is my favorite War game and maybe even my favorite war game of all time. Reason being is due ot it's heartbeating intense firefights. Espicially when you get along with some freinds and mods and completely make Arma into a full on Military Simulator. I honestly think Arma 3 campaign has a great story mode to it, every special part of the campaign made me want to not quit it! Intense scripting and story line for sure! Graphics wise, i think arma 3 has AMAZING graphics for a computer game, however the bad thing is you need a really buffed up computer to do it. Need a new graphics card/video card, and maybe even a new motherboard or CPU will help! Arma 3 multiplayer is OUTSTANDING, it's one of the best multiplayer communitys out there for it's great teamwork players and amazing gamemodes like Altis Life, Wasteland, and Invade And Annex! If you love battlefield, call of duty, or any other war FPS/realism war games this is the game for you and it's worth the money!
2195	1	a	Fantastic progress made by the developers, the most realistic combat style game yet
2197	1	a	ArmA 3, the most universal shooter you might ever need to own. Back in the old days, it was half life which everyone had to own, because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that itÂ´s almost impossible to count them all. And ArmA nower days is pretty much the same, even if youÂ´re not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via itÂ´s big community which wonÂ´t stop generating content until and after the next ArmA will be released.   But be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache, because of itÂ´s bugs. But I have no doubt right now, that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on itÂ´s way to be fixed. Because this game really getÂ´s the love of itÂ´s makers after itÂ´s final release. Theres still an Addon to be awaited as well as a very nice DLC and IÂ´m positively looking forward to it.
2199	1	a	If you're looking for true military combat, with realism in every detail, then this game is for you. Arma 3 at its core is a true military simulation sandbox game. It is the Minecraft of military shooters. Arma allows you to engage in combat at all levels, from ground infantry, to dogfights, to vehicle combat, heck, you can even fight underwater.   If it's possible in real life, it's most likely possible in Arma. If not, there are plenty of mods made by the healthy, active community which can help make your dreams come true. Arma has been known for its modability. DayZ? Yea that was an Arma 2 mod before it was a standalone game. For some, Arma, as a great game alone, is simply a baseplate for you to make whatever you want. There are no limits.   The vast land of Altis (~270 square km) is all playable. There is no 'backdrop' like Call of Duty or Battlefield. There is no one stopping you from playing on top of that awesome looking hill or in that large town. Too big for you? Stratis is only 20 square km. Still too big? Well there's never an issue with going smaller with the great map tools like the editor and Zeus.   The options are limitless. No levels, no unlocks, no pay to win, no stupid DLC so you can have forests or Close Quarters Combat specific maps. Arma 3 is here so you can experience war the way YOU want to. No matter what your interest is, there's sure to be a server or group out there for you. There is no feeling similar to accomplishing a mission that was made and played by real people. No AI, no scripted events, all people. It feels like you just came out of a badass movie battle, because that's pretty much what it just was. That's what this game is about. You want to do it? Go right on ahead. As the saying goes,  make Arma, not war.   Now this review didn't cover everything, and by no means is this game flawless, but it is a game that has kept me interested for quite some time. As such, I will try my best to make a cons vs pros list (cons first because there aren't as much).    CONS
2201	1	a	Why do I play this so much, 10/10 would play again
2203	1	a	I can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. I have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends.   I reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the Zeus free DLC as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the Dungeons and Dragons Role Playing Board Game. This is ow you can have early access to the DLC: &gt;Purchase and download ARMA 3 &gt;Right Click 'ARMA 3' in your steam library &gt;Click 'Properties' &gt;Up the top, you will see a 'Betas' Tab, click it &gt;The click the dropdown arrow next to 'Opt out of all betas' and change it so you are opted into the betas &gt;Click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for ARMA 3, around 1GB &gt;If not, launch hte game, the update should now start &gt;Once the update has finished, launch ARMA 3 &gt;From the main menu play multiplayer &gt;From the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [DEV] tag, this will be running the Zeus DLC &gt;Play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy &gt;Enjoy!  That should be all I need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? Jus jus just.... do it. Take a leap of faith.
2205	1	a	The best war simulator ever, ofc with mods :D
2207	1	a	Great game for anyone looking for a realistic war game. Probably the closest thing you'll actually get to shooting people. 10 potatoes/10 mushrooms.
2209	1	a	how do i play this game???
2211	1	a	This a great game if you liked Arma 2 you will. Love this game
2213	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ these rocks. Step on rock and died 66/6
132	0	a	The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing DLC Is Too Damn Expensive
2215	1	a	I've started playing Altis Life , bought some stuff and a car , and after some time I got killed by a desync.(Altis players will know what I mean) 10/10 but avoid other people
2217	1	a	Absolutely fookin fantastic 10/10 like lads
2219	1	a	Installed the game. Started tutorial. Went on the field. Started shooting - was disappointed. I shot a rabbit for fun, didn't die.......... after 5 seconds the rabbit slammed on the ground. 10/10 best game ever
2221	1	a	Arma 3 is, by far, the best millitary simulator I've ever seen. Only for those who like hardcore millitary simulators.
2223	1	a	This game is just what you would expect from the Bohemia Interactive devs, a great game that is fun with a group of friends. You have many recuring mods in the ARMA series such as island life, wasteland, domination, and even an ARMA 3 port of DayZ, there is even a gamemode only in ARMA 3 called King of the hill. With the multiplayer basis out of the way what about singleplayer? ARMA 3 provides a story driven campaign, and a couple of showcases i.e. Infantry Combat, Aquatic Warfare, etc. ARMA 3 is also returning with a more user friendly mission editor/creator, here you can make your own missions that you or some friends can test out, or upload it to the Steam Workshop. Along with uploading you can also download others missions, some serious, some not. But other than that you should have a great time with this game. Now for the cons (every game has some) just as expected this game is extremely CPU intensive, and GPU intensive, so if you are getting this game make sure you have a good computer. P.S. FPS will be drastically higher in singleplayer compared to multiplayer i.e. SP 45-60 MP 15-30 depending on the server (some are crappy) BEWARE!
2225	1	a	Very fun game.  If you have a group to play with it is much easier and also more funny.  I love flying helicopter and that is oneof my pros with this game.  Headset is useful allround and try the Bootcamp before you head to multiplayer.  Mods and addons is fun to have aswell, and also create own scenarios.   Co-op is my favourite gamemode.  I think I willl have a lot of good times with this game.
2227	1	a	ArmA III is quite different from most other first person shooters. As to be expected since it is a military simulator. With it's clunky UI, desync problems, unexplained gameplay, complicated controls, and many other bugs, it is clearly not perfect. However, when you get past the UI, and have played the game long enough to understand how it works, ArmA III offers some of the best experiences in video gaming. There's nothing quite like a 100 vs 100 match that turns the colossal Altis map or the still giant Stratis map into a war torn battlefield. The true heart to this game is the mods, and boy are there a lot of them! To start, I would suggest checking out Altis Life, Battle Royale, and Wasteland. These mods add so much life to the game. Many of these mods feel like complete individual games themselves.  In short, though there may be some bugs and a steep learning curve, there is no doubt that ArmA III offers arguably the best multiplayer experience in video gaming.  - 9/10 would glitch again
2229	1	a	Finally completed my whole collection of ARMA and this ARMA is one of the best out there. The reason I am so in love with the arma series is because I will join the British Army and ARMA does help if you want that realistic military feeling.  PROS: - Amazing graphics - Great animations - Sh*t ton of mods/addons - Many players on multiplayer - Realistic army simulation - Unlimited things to do - Fun MilSim  Cons: - Not well optimized (Obviously) however I got a stable 40+frames, very high settings+MSAA with my GTX 760. - Voice acting is not the best - F*cking long intro loading screen (There is a loading screen when exiting multiplayer lobby which should not be there at all just takes time. Also for no f*cking reason one eden editor it loads for some time when double clicking a unit then causes the game to crash. Note I do have a fast HDD. - Sometimes the launcher will freeze and won't load anything so I was forced to use a mod launcher - So many errors even if you updated the errors but doesn't happen all the time  To conclude there ain't no other military sim out there that can beat this. Arma 3 is more detailed than the previous arma. If the developers ever release Arma 4 I will be looking forward to it and hopefully it will have a much better optimization so many fans of the Arma series can enjoy.
2231	1	a	You can play this title as a CoD/BF Shooter, a RTS, a MilSim etc. and its perfect in every of this senses! The game got made so that you can play it on every PC/Laptop you could imagine. It runs everywhere but of course the graphics aren't as good as on a gaming pc.  The game fearures (the in my opinion) biggest and greatest community ever. There are hundrets of great addons, and they are all free!  In conclusion: This game has everything for everyone. Deticated Server for LAN-Parties, very variable difficulty, great graphics, a giant open world, a free in-game editor and much more. Simply a must-have!
2233	1	a	ItÂ´s Arma, so I canÂ´t recommend it, if you ever played arma withhout beeing a fanboy you know the flaws and bugs it has cause theyÂ´re still the same as in arma 2 and thatÂ´s how easy it is!
2235	1	a	Get this game! It's amazing!
2237	1	a	You can slide around on your butt. 11/10
2239	1	a	its like skyrim, with military grade weapons
2241	1	a	All the hours speak for itself.
2243	1	a	Awesome game, there is so much you can do here, everything from sandbox to tactical realism. Both the multiplayer and singleplayer areas have huge playability levels. Plus new content is being added weekly so you never get bored. Awesome game, one of my all time favorites. Highly recommend.
2245	1	a	it's arma.
2247	1	a	Most imersive shooter I've ever played. Tons of mods and wonderfull gaming experience when you have a performant PC and good clan to play it with ;) Check out Black Legion  (http://www.black-legion.co.uk/)  to see what we do in Arma III ;)
2249	1	a	Spent way to long on this game, love it.
2251	1	a	a game where walls are just for show and you can walk right through em,A game where ifrits are unbreakable no matter the height, a game where you can fuken get thrown out of a c130 and ram into the ground and live Great game
2253	1	a	Bought game, played online, ran 10.3km to battlezone, 30 minutes later died to enemy behind bush.  10/10 - Will play again.
2255	1	a	Best $60 I have spent on a game. There is just so much you can do with arma right out of the package - King of the Hill, Altis Life, Wasteland etc. Then there are many options being created by community members in the form of modifications; guns, vehicles, gamemodes. If you're on the fence i suggest you just buy it. There really is a community for just about everyone in Arma.
2257	1	a	The best realistic battlefield game ever!!
2259	1	a	ArmA 3 will consume you and your Social life!  Thought I would play Exile DayZ with a few friends, we spawned sky diving over Altis, we try and find each other whilst looting houses and fighting the undead, moments later we are all together at last.  As we walked for ages we thought that we should rest up so I find out we have xm8 Mobile tablets, I use it and spawn a push bike, the other's do the same.  As we was all riding into the town, one of us could not stop in time and crashes into a wall, he died on impact, so I park up and get off to say my goodbye's, another friend runs me over with my bike whilst I said good bye, he stands there next to our body's to protect our loot, we both return to our bodies. Collected all our gear and realised our friend had taken ammo from each of us. We confront him in a building. He says he never took it, he gets shot in head.  As we loot his corpse he had taken our ammo. So the simple conclusion behind this story is..... You cant trust anyone, Not even friends!
2261	1	a	  It is totally amazing game
2263	1	a	So many game modes to choose from, including the ability to make your own including missions and mods, arma 3 is much more than a military game. It is a platform for all sorts of multiplayer fun. The bugs are a many, especially ones that make you question the 'realism' but it adds to the laughter and you get used to it. For a game so old, the devs are still working hard on it, always bringing updates with new content as well as bug fixes. TL:DR well worth it if you like Multiplayer games and shooting people.
2265	1	a	Military simulation at it's best, for a game. From bullet drop and distance to the vehicles and movment. Unfortutunately, not set in the cold war like arma 2 but, is definetly worth buying, espically with friends.
2267	1	a	Still early days for me yet as I am still learning, but what I have seen from this game so far is nothing but awesomeness...   VAST LANDSCAPE - the map is absolutely huge... some players end up having a full time job air lifting people to the hotzone and then back to base and pick up the next lot of soldiers...  The GRAPHICS - are absolutely spectacular  THE SOUND - is amazing, really is an immersive experience  REALISM - The most realistic military game I have ever played... if you are a Call of Duty fan... forget it, get out of this page and do not buy this game... You cannot go in guns blazing, you cannot even run from cover to cover without getting puffed out in which causes you to lose accuracy... Battlefield players that feel that Battlefield just doesn't have enough realism, you may appreciate this game as I am an ex-battlefielder and I love this game...  THE BAD - Extremely hard... and there are soooo many buttons to remember, but practice makes perfect...  9/10 - it loses a point because you cant just pick it up and play, it requires lots of time, practice, patience and discipline.
2269	1	a	Shooting dudes is all that keeps me sane.
2271	1	a	The third part of the legendary ARMA-Series. A new milestone in the history of Military Simulations in realtime. Awesome. Great Work and thanks to Bohemia. It must be continued. Endlazer.
2273	1	a	Shooting dudes is all that keeps me sane.
2275	1	a	i think i need a few more hours to write a good review for this game
2277	1	a	Amazing game for anyone who enjoys a fun military simulation! Great gameplay, graphics, lots of interesting mods and high replay-ability.
2279	1	a	ARMA 3 has been a constantly evolving game. Definitely worth checking out now that it's a more refined experience, has tons of incredible user created scenarios, a lot of variety online, and finally, the first part of the campaign is available. This has been the most fun I've had in a shooter all year, and I expect to continue enjoying it for years to come.
2281	1	a	I think this game is a great military sim.It combines teamwork with tactics and mixes it up with mods and good bots that will give you a run for your money.Now ive only played this for the free weekend so I cant give you a super good reveiw but I will say that from what me and my brother played that this game is vary fun and challenging game and we will definetly buy it in the upcomeing days
2283	1	a	100/10 would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ buy again
2285	1	a	Nothing Can Beat Arma !!
2287	1	a	Played many hours on this, great game and great modding support
2289	1	a	Probably the best game ive ever played.....117 hours in the past 2 weeks.....nuff said.......
2291	1	a	It created my love of artillery and mortars. But you know, it's great for other things too. Just buy it for the amazing milsim, waste of money for everything else it has.
2293	1	a	Just play it.
2295	1	a	Solid game- Very multi purpose Dayz King of the hill Realism And much more! Love it cant love it more unless the DLC WAS FREEE!!!! 
2297	1	a	I think this game is a great military sim.It combines teamwork with tactics and mixes it up with mods and good bots that will give you a run for your money.Now ive only played this for the free weekend so I cant give you a super good reveiw but I will say that from what me and my brother played that this game is vary fun and challenging game and we will definetly buy it in the upcomeing days
2299	1	a	Awesome game. Already played it for 1700+ hours, and it doesnt get boring ;). The Apex DLC is really good aswell.
2301	1	a	What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this new update? Why can't a company such as bohemia interactive understand a VERY simple concept such as stamina? Like in what world does a TRAINED soldier run out of breath afer like a couple of steps?
2303	1	a	Went onto a life community -&gt; Bought a car -&gt; Got arested for being black -&gt; Got out of prison -&gt; Died becouse of a 12 year old that couldnt drive   10/10 so realistic
2305	1	a	Good Realistic war game, BIg map, just buy it
2307	1	a	A game that mixes Graphics, Realism and a Millitary genre all into one. The game is very intense whether it be playing against bots or being taken hostage on your favourite RPG or 'Life' server.   The Editor mode is simply amazing with so much variety in it. You can make either a hostage situation or rise up against a city and take power for once and for all.  THe graphics in this game are simply amazing. Though, you must have a beasty computer to have Okay FPS. If you lower the settings it will be very harsh on your CPU but as the graphics go up the intensity on the gpu goes up. So that could really be improved on in the next Arma.  The DLC's are amazing. Helicopter, giving you a huge variety of helicopter of your choice to fly around the insanely large maps to conquer. Marksmen, be the best sniper in town and pick people off from hundreds of metres away. Karts, If you want to have a bit of fun and drive around in your mini go cars and mess around with people. Always a laugh... Tanoa, a Insane new jungle mape with improved helicopters and unmanned vehicles, oh and new kalashnikovs, what could be better. Though unfortunately the price, too high Bohemia!

2309	1	a	ArmA 3 is one of the best things that ever happened to me and my friends. I've given it a place in my heart and it has given me a place in it's heart.  If you want to be a serious army soldier, ArmA 3 has it for you.  If you want to play like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, arma 3 surely has it for you. The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing, the modding community suits every need. And I think that's what makes Bohemia Interactive a very good producer. They understand they can't make the perfect game that suits everyone's needs, so that's why they make modding so easy.  Would very much recommend this game, community's nice, gameplay is nice, virtually the game is amazing if your pc can handle it. Loads of hours went into this game, and I loved every single second of it and if I were to stand in your shoes, wondering if I would buy this game after reading this, you friggin' should.
2311	1	a	Probably the best game ive ever played.....117 hours in the past 2 weeks.....nuff said.......
2313	1	a	Good Realistic war game, BIg map, just buy it
2315	1	a	Awesome game. Already played it for 1700+ hours, and it doesnt get boring ;). The Apex DLC is really good aswell.
2317	1	a	The best military sim ever!!!
2319	1	a	I dont own this game but it says i do.  10/10 would play again. 
2321	1	a	I love this game
2323	1	a	I really like this game, it's really fun has alot of cool and fun mods you can play alone or with friend, I would recommend this game.  
2325	1	a	I played it a little. It's ok.
2327	1	a	(TL;DR IS AT THE BOTTOM)  ahh who remembers good old Operation Flashpoint. Not that crap modern sheit, but BI's Operation Flashpoint. There are some that don't know that Arma is it's direct ancestor btw. Anyways when I was young (too young for the game ill bet oooo edgy) i sank a good few thousand hours into OFP Cold War Crisis and its expansions. Eventually i played Arma 2. i wasn't really very impressed due to the crashes and the actual graphical look of the game was horrible. Some sorta film grain gone wrong  Then the recent free weekend rolled around for Arma 3. I was so impressed that i had to buy myself a Â£95 headset - and that was the cheapest price for it. I'd probably have a few more 10s of hours in the game, but its the studying time of the year. But this game. Sure it has a weird looking stealth-inspired vehicles, but its Arma. It's moddable, and BI encourage you to mod, unlike almost every other company. That means you get things like Iron Front (an Arma 2 mod turned into a full game turned into an Arma 3 mod, confusing i know) that features WWII campaigns with maps and units to play with in the editor. It means you get JSRS, a sound mod that changes so many sounds in the game - the one i notice the most is the jets. the jets sound real, and when you wear a surround sound headset or have surround speakers, it sounds real. makes me feel like i'm in the Lake District for some reason. (the RAF does training there).  and then theres the multiplayer. i'm not even going to go further than saying the best servers are the 77th JSOC co-op EU1 and EU2. unless youre murican. if youre murican, you lag. go away. if youre a kid, dont even touch my favourite servers. if youre looking for a group that actually plays together as a team, go no further than the 77th. the rest of the co-op servers cant actually work co-op if they got paid to do it. idk even know why im writing a review i just wanted to tell you about the best server on arma. and that altislife sheeit is for kids who shouldnt even be playing the game. you want to roleplay go play â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gmod  anyway everyone tells a funny story so this one time on 77th its late night irl, its dark ingame too. barely anyone is online. so im leading a squad, and we are driving from the airport to the AO south east of pygros in a HEMTT transport. it takes so long the squad in the back starts shooting rabbits from the back and talking about stuff soldiers talk about, idk. half an hour later, literally, we are nearly there. i cant see the AO, but its just over a hill in front of us. then theres a sound... and then another sound, like a rocket. so yeah a jet comes out of nowhere. entire squad leaves and im left on my own in base.  10/10 tl;dr  OFP CWC is Arma, Arma 2 had a bad film grain effect, Arma 3 free weekend, got headphones, mods like Iron Front and JSRS, RAF does training in the Lake District, 77th JSOC owns the best 2 servers in the game - americans and squeekers stay out, altislife is for kids that should go back to gmod, and finally i drive a HEMTT transport full of soldiers to their death by jet.  Arma 3, 10/10 not IGN (has enough water)
2329	1	a	This is a really great game! This is not a game for people who are going for a Call Of Duty style gameplay. There are some bugs but the developers are usually good at finding and fixing them. Cool DlC's are released frequently. The physics are quite nice, no un-realistic ragdoll effects when you die, nice vehicle handling, just dont fall down the stairs or else you wil die haha, they do need to fix that. The campaign is a thrilling story of a young Corporal Kerry who you'll play as. The maps are EXTREMELY detailed everywhere, there are so many cool and breath-taking areas of the two islands of Stratis and Altis. There are tons of servers and gamemodes so you can't be bored. There is also the option to mod this game in so many cool and fantastic ways it seems endless! But be warned, the controls are not so easy, they are not your simple stand, crouch, prone. The vehicle's controlling is decent but you will likely need some practice for the jets and helicopters which I had to do. The AI's path-taking and combat skills are impressive, at times they can act stupid. This game is a must-have for the computer gamer! I give this game a solid 5 out of 5 stars for its gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a next level military simulation game. The developer's team is bunch of people who really do know what they are doing to make this game outstanding to play. This is not a game where you might think of a bunch of kids acting like they are United States Navy Seals or British SAS, you should think this game as a serious, fun, educational game of how military might work and fight in a simulated warzone. I hope this review encourages you to buy the game AND the DLC for it! I know I will be a constant customer with the amount of great work the developers have done to Arma 3.
2331	1	a	Must buy if you like military tactical shooters
134	0	a	Very disapointed.
135	0	a	Sheitty DLC that is about the same price of the full game? Hell yeah!  Optimization? Naaahhh who needs that.
2333	1	a	Scrubland running simulator 2014 is the most realistic scrubland running simulator on the market today. There are two whole islands to explore with varying degrees of grasslands, scrublands, deserts and even pine forests! You can even run through the scrublands as a rabbit or a chicken. Your imagination is truly the limit in this game. 10 despawn seagulls/10.
2335	1	a	My car blew up when i honked at someone. 10/10
2337	1	a	When you look at most of the customer reviews on typical games, you'll generally see anywhere from 2-8 hours of playtime. Looking through the reviews for Arma 3, a majority that I see are over 100 hours and quite a few over 300-400 hours.   I think that speaks for itself.
2339	1	a	As the 3rd installment to the Arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other Arma game. With the RV4 it adds in DirectX 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise. The clunky mechanics from Arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in Arma 3. Although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest Arma to date! Multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns! Overall i'd recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters!
2341	1	a	Great game
2343	1	a	11/10
2345	1	a	Arma 3, contrary to popular belief, is a very good game. It really just depends on who you are, or who you play with. If you spend your entire time playing Arma 3 hoping to have an experience similar to Dayz, you won't have much fun. What you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as Domination, and coordinate with your entire team. Keep in mind that Arma 3 is nothing like Battlefield or Call of Duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at. You have to talk to your squad, even if it is people you don't even know very well, because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad. All in all, Arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly.
2347	1	a	Arma 3 is simply the best combat simulator there is. and if you're playing alone or with friends, the game is fun either way.
2349	1	a	Went to a weed field to gather some cannabis and got arrested by undercover cops.  10/10 would sell weed again. 
2351	1	a	Yeah it's not half bad.
2353	1	a	This game is the best war simulator you can get on steam, it cost alot, but it's worth it. Spend 100 hours in this game, enjoyed every single minute.  Recommended mods for this amazing game:  Breaking point(Kinda fun) Battle Royale(Most intensive â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ever) Epoch(Same as Breaking point, but with building, so it's abit better.) Arma3Life(Best roleplay, alot of new cars, guns. Well it was fun atleast, when it was closed beta now it's kinda shity.)
2355	1	a	Whilst still not as refined as it's predecessor Arma 3 offers a host of improvements in it's engine and graphics. The community is growing and you can expect to find a vast array of experiences from the many game-modes on offer:  CTI (Capture the Island) KOTH (King of the Hill) Life Roleplaying Battle Royale Team Deathmatch Zeus COOP Patrol Ops COOP Invade and Annex COOP  To really appreciate this game find a good group of people to play with and it'll probably become the best gaming investment you ever made!
2357	1	a	amazing game and a great improvement from arma2, the controls are a bit confusing at first if youre used to arma2 but after getting used to them i noticed that arma3 has at least twice the fps of arma2 on my laptop and i have the graphics settings set to med/high instead of low/med as i did on arma2  still waiting for the modding community to become as active on this as it is on arma2
2359	1	a	tl;dr Game is slower paced but very good.  This game is the pinnacle of the military FPS subgenre. It literally does not get any better than this when it comes to realistic shooters. Do not go into the game expecting fast paced shooting like in most modern shooters. Expect to use tactics and work with your team to overcome enormous obstacles.  This is not for people who need to shoot something every 5 seconds. Most of the meat of the gameplay is in coordinating with your squadmates, completing objectives, and getting shots in from sometimes thousands of yards away. Every kill is a small victory in this game; getting 8 kills during a multiplayer coop mission is something to be proud of, depending on the mission. The satifsfaction from eliminating enemies in this game is not one of 'I got a lot of kills' but 'I helped my squad complete an objective.'  Personally I didn't like ARMA 2 because of how clunky it felt with both it's inventory management and control, but that's completely remedied in ARMA 3. Movement feels responsive and the inventory is streamlined and easy to understand.  The developers are adding new features to this game for free constantly and workshop support + numerous mods ranging from full conversions to minor gameplay improvements ensure that there is no end to the amount of content you can download for this game. On top of that, at least from the people I've played with the community is stellar, the fact that this is a 'Hardcore' shooter means that most of the kiddies who come from 'That game franchise' get bored and leave immediately leaving only the dedicated whom are willing to learn and utilize the unique gameplay mechanics. This has to be the first game where the times I've actually run into 12 year olds, they were just as helpful, attentive, and cooperative as the average good player.   Expect to walk for long periods of time before engaging in any actual firefight and expect to train yourself in single player before joining an online game. I had to play  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192094335&amp;searchtext=Helicopter+Training  for a good four hours before I was comfortable with flying a heli let alone going into enemy lines with one; Even after I'm still a bit rusty. But I'll get better. Same with learning how to operate a sniper rifle, which actually involves adjusting distance for your bullets to go where you want them to. A mission I play often to train in sniping is  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227323006&amp;searchtext=Blue+viper    My gripes with the game extend to at times awful friendly/enemy AI, really. Another thing is that this game could have benefitted from a demo or benchmark as the optimization is different than ARMA 2's and many I know are unsure if this game will run right on their lower end PCs. The game could also do with an official mod manager that streamlines server mod downloads; it's easy to download missions but not mods. You'll be able to play on only very few servers since most run some mod like ACRE or a mod that one might have to go on a wild google chase to find.  Edit: Workshop Support has been added for mods instead of just campaigns.  One technical aspect I REALLY appreciate is the fact that you don't have to manually forward any ports to host a server. Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ only few have any idea how much of a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ that is. I'm glad that ARMA just lets you host a server for your buddies, hassle free. Thank you, bohemia.  Edit: Since gamespy went down this is no longer the case and you need hamachi. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  All in all, I recommend this game highly, even at $60, which I will almost never do. But this game is so fully featured and refreshing that I find it hard to tell you to wait for a sale. But again, I cannot stress enough that this game is for the team player and the highly attentive. It is not for run and gunners or lone wolves. Movement is more likely to get you killed than save you most of the time. I've only put in 25 or so hours so far but I see myself playing this game for a total of hundreds in the future.
2361	1	a	A squeaker bought me this game.
2363	1	a	whatever
2365	1	a	Great Game, Great Modding Platform, Great Community.  if you liked Arma 2, you will most likely like Arma 3. Modding Community is really busy, Mod Content is nearly limitless.
2367	1	a	Diz gime is bes gam eber cuz it haz grapix and if you pres v button you dance. but lots of haxerz i prezed alt f4 and dey haxd my game annd make me quite the game!!
2369	1	a	I love this game, spent many hours into various kinds of game modes from Alpha to release.   I have played many singleplayer maps which I have gotten from the Workshop, some I have spent countless of hours restarting over and over again, just to enjoy it a little bit more. and some I have played with my friends in various fun co-op missions.  I have played various multiplayer modes from Wasteland, King of the hill, to Altis Life. I have had my moments of rage, and I have had my crazy ammount of laughter.  If you like a good FPS game with a great ammount of depth and lots of replayability, then this is a game for you.  If you like to sit on a hill far away from the combat sniping down on the unknown enemy soldiers, then this is a game for you. If you enjoy commandering a group of troops, hell, even a whole army in battle, then this is a game for you. Or if you just want to do illegal drug business while avoiding cops in Altis Life, then this is a game for you. I feel repetive now, but I really enjoy this game, and hope you do so too.  Sorry if there is any grammatic errors in the text, english is not my native language.

2375	1	a	Been so busy into the simulator for the last 3 years since release, I forgot about writing a review, notice how I said Simulator and not game, there's a reason for that you know.  First and foremost, as a military / enthusiast guy, since operation flashpoint, to arma 2, and now this, Arma 3, I can without a doubt say, it has increased my military knowledge by 50%. The other 50% is just personal knowledge / Experience.  This Military Simulator is for someone that is either in the military already, has plans to get into the military, or is just a military enthusiast that is hungry to know more about modern combat and how it works.  With the right set of mods, and the correct group of friends that match the criteria to your standards of MilSim, then I can say you are ready to conduct real time operations within a simulator and study that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for your own personal use.  The amount of knowledge you can get from this software is Unbelievable.  Now, it won't give you the balls to go battle, but it will definitly give you outstanding information in regards of how to survive a battle (in real life). Have no plans of going into battle, that's fine, but for your next hike, you can learn how to navigate through any terrain with the right map and compass.  I can go on and on on its uses and pro's, but I will leave it here, if you want to join one of the most professional military simulator Community out there that is free to join, go ahead and register at,   www.unitedoperations.net   there you'll meet me, and many other military dudes that provide courses on a regular basis (FOR FREE).  And remember, THIS IS NOT A GAME, it's a SIMULATION!
136	0	a	It's a really epic game, but the sad fact of the matter is, it's optimized like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and not likely to get any better. My system is decent, and I'm not going to argue the point, but nobody should have to be buying new fá¹»cking chipsets to get 60fps on a game this old, especially when it's more than a year old.  Gameplay? It's really fun, unless you're dÃ¯cking around in one of the thousands of poorly setup servers where you can only get like 13fps tops because whoever is running it is incompetent.  There's a TON of mod support. You can literally download gigs and gigs of mods from the workshop to do all kinds of things and it's amazing.   Get it on sale if you're going to get it, and don't buy this unless you have a significantly powerful cpu.
137	0	a	Ok so this game... The gameplay is so-so and the graphics are ok but where this game shines is the map editor. It's very in depth and pretty darn complicated, but in a good way. It has provided me with hours of tweaking and changing maps and scenarios to fit what I want to play. However, it is not user friendly at all. It is extremely painful and takes a ton of trial and error to use. You will think up a good scenario in a few hours and get your unites placed and then spend the next 30 hours way points and triggers and scripts. It is unreal. Not to mention all the time you will spend watching youtube videos and reading guides. Even if it was easy to create games it wouldn't matter because their game hosting is absolutely broken so the only person who will see your creation is you. There is a maze of technical bullcrap just to host a game for your friends to join. As if spending 40+ hours on a single scenario to enjoy with your friends wasn't quite enough and now you gotta spend an entire work week reading forums and deciphering technical jargon just to simply host a game. How could you fail this miserably as developers? This is the foundation of multiplay FPS and you just can't do it. Fail.
2377	1	a	Very great update compared to arma2
2379	1	a	Arma 3 is an improvement and significant step forward over the previous in its franchise, securing its top spot as the go to for military simulation. Arma 3 makes big steps forward with huge worlds and more varied vehicles and weapons. With the clever integration of the Steam workshop, player-made content has never been easier to install and manage. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it's these fan based mods that are the backbone of Arma and will give Arma 3 endless hours of replayability. With the effortless downloading and installation of a huge library of player created mods, from team driven tactical scenarios to the the chaotic survival mods, it's a must have for any shooter enthusiast. 
2381	1	a	Great it's supposed to be a ''simulator'' and that word kinda means boring this is gonna be so hard ect. Nope this is realistc game that does take too much skill well depends on what you do but it VERY FUN! you should get this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2383	1	a	One of the best military sim out there. I have over 1000 hrs on this game and still counting. This game has a variety of gamemodes and community made gamemodes like King Of The Hill, Wasteland etc. This game even features realistic bullet ballistics and full moding suppert. And speaking of mods. There are TONS AND TONS of mods outthere that enchanes sound and game mechanics and AI improvent. Though there is some small optimation problems with the game its a 10/10 GET THIS GAME
2385	1	a	played it a bit its good.
2387	1	a	Collect flowers and bugs in the lands of Altis and Stratis with a bit of get f*cked up the rear while doing it. 9/10
141	0	a	Not worth $60 gets boring and controls and very hard and the game is hard to play with people.
2389	1	a	Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though, making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.
2391	1	a	Arma 3 is another hard core shooter. It's hard to get into when you have never palyed Arma II. The graphics are amazing. There are multiple different scenarios to play if you dont feel like playing multiplayer. But I would say multiplayer is where the game is at its best. It may take some time to get into the action which is where the Arma 3 fails at, but once you are in the heat of battle the gameplay is unmatched by anyhting else. Communicating with squad mates, tactically moving about to achieve the objective, and the feeling of being in huge squad is just something no other game in my opinion has achieved. If you are interested in Arma 3 then I recommend you buy it. Although I don't have much time in Arma 3, and I have played many other FPS, I can clearly say that this is one of the better FPS out there. The first time I got into battle was what changed my view of Arma 3.
2393	1	a	Buy It.
2395	1	a	Seems to be pretty good so far.
143	0	a	cant join any server, i can get easily to lobby, but when i try to connect and it loads up ll the missiondata, it just puts me back to main menu when its finished loading... tried so many things, reinstalled serveral times, deleted eerything and reinstalled but nothing worked for me and it seems that im currently the only one who has this problem..
144	0	a	What in the name of all that is holy,is wrong with this game. Well I will tell you.  Aside from some new wepons,this is the exact same game as arma 2. The 'new' invantory system is just as terrible as the old one,and requires a 3 day class in order to understand how it operates. The way that cars trucks and tanks function is just as horrid and un-predictable as it was in arma 2. I can still do a loop-d-loop in most aircraft at under 100 yards altattude. the campain is luaghable with a bad story,bad vice acting, and filled with stupid bugs. In order to play the game you have to attend basic training,not on combat tactics or proper map reading mind you,no you need basic traning on how the heck to move,access invantory or piont your gun. 90% of the time I spend fighting the engine and bad mechanics that make the game hard to play. 10% i spend having fun shooting bad guys or working with a team compleate a great COMUNITY CREATED mod. And that brings Me to My last piont how the hell did arma get such a great comunity? They release an unfinished game,the cumminity buys it,and then finishes it for them. The only fun modes are the ones supplied by the comunity. This game is one of the worst repersentations of the FPS and tactical shooter genras.  The only reason this game is fun,is becuase the cammunity creates awesome mods,and fixes all the terrible bugs.   I rate this game 2/10
145	0	a	needs optimizations
2397	1	a	Seems to be pretty good so far.
2399	1	a	The most amazing, most realistic game ive seen in a war game. The community is mature and friendly its amazing. The kind of game you wont get bored of easily.  And the game that you would rage a lot for dieing but meh who gives XD. I recommend it. The kind of game that brought me back to gaming.  Keep up the good work.
157	0	a	ArmA III could have, and still could be, a great game. It is only set back by few things.  Pro-  Great Graphics- It looks amazing, and even makes old maps look better then they did in ArmA II Stance System- Now you no longer have to go prone if your head was sticking out a bit PhysX- You no longer get the really wonky physics that appeared in ArmA II Ragdoll- Running over people is now a LOT more fun!  Con- (spoiler, theres more than the Pro) Awful Performance- They said that any computer that could play ArmA II could play ArmA III, they never said at a playable framerate Inventory- I still dont understand it, I mean you had ArmA II weird UI, now you have a even weirder drag-and-drop UI (Just use DayZ SA inventory, its fast and makes a load of sense) Dreadful Netcode- Still running ArmA crappy netcode, now with every server at 200 ping Missing Content- The game only has planes and transport helicoptors for Indies, not Blu or OP, so it makes missions on either end really wierd with green helis (Yes, there is mods that add planes, but you shouldn't rely on the modding community to finish your game for you)  In all ArmA 3 is a sad avoid, DayZ standalone is still doing better in its alpha than ArmA 3 did in its. It could get better as the stupid 'Free DLC' thing goes on, but a spin-off team working on a zombie game did better then BI's main team. It's just kinda insaulting
2401	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2403	1	a	If ARMA 4 does not come out, I will slit your mother.
2405	1	a	i dont even have this game why am i able to write a review?
158	0	a	i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ?? 
159	0	a	Keeps Crashing broke
2407	1	a	Finally a game that is not casual targetandshoot, in ArmA you first have to plan your mission and then 95% of the time run around. But that feeling when running to an OP, taking position, knowing that you are gonna open fire soon...Just awesome.   As in the old ArmAs you get a lot of online mods, but also a very complicated control system and not much for your hardware. But i mean: It still looks very well on a Mid-End PC.  Also it is cool that Vehicels are powered rightly (some a bit OP, Bohemsia keeps patching, so...) and that you can discover the Whole huge map  So, I would say definitly buy, if you are clear that this is a simulation, not just a Battlefield or CoD
162	0	a	Why is this â™¥â™¥â™¥ game laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even on a GTX 1070 and a i7 cpu
163	0	a	It' a good game with amazing graphicks, good gameplay, lots of mods and great multiplayer. However i got bored so fast (I spend a lot of time in fps Counter Strike- 386 h) and for me its too boring to spend that money. But it depends on you and what you like this is my personal oppinion you might like it. Thanks for your attention and rememeber to check out the game!
164	0	a	Only purchase this game if you are willing to purchase the apex edition for 70 damn dollars. Most AAA games are 60 and unless your just going to play the campaign, you are going to need to purchase the apex edition if you don't want to be swarmed with watermark ads when you attempt to use most weapons and vehicles. This price is too high for what you get in return. Many other games have double the amount of gameplay material than what this game has, and the price for the apex edition is still higher. Yes, I understand that there is the 'base content' and the 'apex' edition is just 'extra' but if I'm going to have to pay 70 dollars for this..... and many other games have way more content...... its a little bit high of a price. Of course, the arma devs probably won't see this review and if they do, well, im just one of the few people that think the price is too high for the quality of gameplay. On the other hand, I'd say minimum at least 40% of the people who bought this game don't even have a job. Just asked mom for the credit card and called it good. But hey, what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do i know?
165	0	a	Do not get this game unless you have a group of friends to play it with. Seriously.  The public multiplayer servers are mostly atrocious (King of the Hill is the best you'll get, but even that blows), and MOST of them are just perpetually empty. The single player campaign is laughably bad - from terrible voice acting to bad writing to ludicrously magical super-AI that snipes you through a bush from 1,500m away ... it's just a constant exercise in frustration.  The game is horribly optimized and constantly dropping frames, seemingly irrelevant of what's actually happening on your screen.  Also worth mentioning that, unless you wanna shell out another ~$60 for the DLC, you're not going to be able to use about half of the weapons in the game, or access the superior map. The default maps, Stratis and Altis, are boring islands completely devoid of any real life, aside from a few dozen copy/pasted towns and miles and miles of blank, arid land. The DLC map, Tanoa, looks signifcantly better - but I'm not paying $30 for a good map and around a dozen weapon reskins.  Unless you're a glutton for clunky punishment, this game is not for you.
2409	1	a	Sometimes me and my friend would make little prison camps for civies and crash jets into it to slowly kill them off. I know we are tAIRable people.  Oh yeah and the games good too.
166	0	a	This is going to be a pretty long review of ArmA 3 so lets get started. ArmA 3 is an open world Military simulator, designed to capture real war. And it does this fairly well. But I cannnot recommend the game for the following reasons.   Firstly we will start with the Pros and then the Cons.      Pros:         ArmA3 is set on either Stratis, Altis or Tanoa depending if you purchased the DLC or not. Stratis is a good small map with good positions for setting up interesting military operations same with Altis. Tanoa is a Fujian like terrain with many trees and bushes allowing for jungle type warfare scenarios which is both interesting and engauging.       The game is highly moddable you can write scripts to add new functionality or create models that create new types of gameplay. Such as new weapons or vehicles. The engine is powerful in terms of versitility but not so great in other aspects.       Vehicle,uniforms and weapon content is quite wide in terms of what you get for the base game but all the other DLCs add a fair bit more than what the base game offers including a new jungle type map.       The game is visually appealling with post processing effects including 16bit HDR and Your basic bloom effects. It also has high resolution textures for all vehicles players and objects.      There exists a pretty wide range of game mode variation from Invade &amp; Annex to KoTH all the way to GTA remake called Altis Life.      The games weather is a real testiment to what TrueSky can do it's beautiful the sky along with the cloud and weather effects. combined withe HDR the game comes quite close to actual real life sky colouring. Coupled with the weather effects sound improvements that game with Tanoa eliminated the tin sounding thunder claps.        Cons:         Game suffers extreme bottlenecks in the rendering loop with super-sampling. A resolution of 200% set in ArmA 3 results in a massive drop in videocard usage. to nearly 28% This is probably due to ArmA 3 not feeding enough work to the videocard as a result the videocard is always waiting for an update.      Game depends on single core clock performance because of how the threading model works. Simply put the game main thread sit on a single core with worker threads sent to other cores, those worker threads report back to the main thread so in the instance that a worker thread is in the geometry rendering or texture rendering the main-loop is in a wait-state for the sub-threads to report back their status as a result CPU and GPU usage drop like a brick.       Artificial Intelligence is definitely not intelligence the AI are smart enough to aimbot you thats about it and you have to use external scripts to fix something that should already be in place. I mean tab into zues and they have a missile reticle on your player behind a build / tree. They drive and are as smart as your little toys you used to have as a kid that would crash into a wall turn randomly in 1 direction then move forward and repeat. Half the time never actually getting around the obstacle      The community is rude and generally arrogant, you ask certain questions and they will attack your coding because you did 1 thing wrong instead of actually pointing out the problem they bash what you did. They are certainly not real programmers in any respect.       The scripting engine is yes versitile and functional but thats about it. Many nuances exist in the scripting engine and documentation for it is dismal and lacking. Edited by the community through much trial and error. And assumed functionality from previous experience. Python or Lua which Lua is more commmonly found in other games as a script API are known to have very good documentation as they are so wide spread SQF on the other hand is a mess a god damn mess.       Networking wise the game doesn't scale beyond 40 - 50 players depending on the server, but in general for example KoTH with all it's server-side mod components and client side it still suffers massive FPS drops when clients get close together ArmA 3 is a military simulator engine is people repeatedly try to treat it like GTA or an MMO type game engine which it is not, and so performance overall suffers considerably when we get &gt; 50 players online.       Mods don't follow a standard of work, as such anyone can publish ArmA 3 mods, even if they may contain catastrophic bugs that lead to memory leakage in the sense of external dlls or scripts.       Scripts also don't follow a standard of work, standardisation is almost non-existent in game and people often slap scripts together and hope for the best. Without considering the consequences of that script.      Code theft and thievery is rampant 1 community develops something the other has to steal it from that community. People also try to threaten about code supposably owned by previous communities which it is only owned by them if money was to change hands and or contracts were signed which if they were not would not matter by default you own the code rights.       Apex DLC is only worth the money if you only care about the map the map is the most interesting part of Tanoa thats about it.       Many missions are highly toxic and encourage disgusting gameplay behaviour and the related. wasteland,Altis Life and KoTH are just mere reincarnations of Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and DayZ modification. May as well be.       Gameplay becomes boring an uninteresting after being both drained by the communities and the script engine not cooperating for whatever undocumented stupid reason.       The wiki documentation is a mess a total mess certain pages re-route to completely unrelated pages repeatedly, with a nesting effect there is no class inheritence or order, the wiki is mostly chaotic and messy.       Communiities have a real sense of entitlement just because you wrote it you should share it, this is not the case. With the above stated 'theivery' of code. People feel they deserve it in the community because of knowledge they contributed to the wiki etc. They are entititled to sweet f.a .     Thats just my little breakdown and rant about how bad the game is and it's problems. If bohemia were to fix the framerate problems many people experience from people with I7-6700K at 4.0Ghz to I7-5820K at 3.3 Ghz then I might consider it recommedable, but this game is still suffering framerate problems 2 years since it's release. The community hasn't cleaned up it's act and the game still does poor usage of videocard resources it should be using a lot more. The engine is old and archiac and requires both 64bit addressing in order to help the large maps without having to stream the data by dynamically loading and unloading data on the fly to get around the 32bit memory problem. 64bit memory would also allow more resources to be utilised because more threads often require more RAM. For each of their instances.        This is my first and last Bohemia game I will buy    
167	0	a	this glitchy game can suck it! pay to win, and terrible online and every time they have a patch it screws something else up and its been like this for like 3 years! wtf! I have been trying to play this online for an hour now and no luck. not worth it.  120$ for an unfinished game with DLC that favors money spenders. By all means teach them a lesson and do not give them your business until they shape up, we dont need another call of duty clone   almost 600hrs wasted thanks bohemian.
168	0	a	i bough this game by my old laptop which had minimum req. . it was always crash to desktop after 5 min game play . there wasnt a solution. after 2 years i buyed desktop pc for arma 3 literally. specs is r7 265 amd fx 6300 its not a bad rig. i can play on high-ultra most other new games . whats is my fps now ? do you worry about it ? IT IS ''15'' !!!!!!!!!!!!! LOWER OR HIGHER OPTIONS NOTHING DIFFERENCE ITS F... 15 FPS ON KOTH MODE . dont f...ing buy this game if u dont have 5000 dolars rig . BAD Optimization...................... sry for bad english. ALMAYIN ALDIRMAYIN 10000 TL LIK PC NIZ YOKSA
2411	1	a	Sometimes me and my friend would make little prison camps for civies and crash jets into it to slowly kill them off. I know we are tAIRable people.  Oh yeah and the games good too.
2413	1	a	Sniping people from about 2000m with a .50... Get's killed by AI 2000m away from me...with a pistol... Really good game 10/10 
2415	1	a	I downloaded Breaking point, a basic Dayz mod for Arma 3 with the main maps and some other maps. If you like Dayz, and Arma itself too, buy it. I force fed a can of hotdogs to a stranger and killed someone with a brick. Like team survival games with objectives? Check out wasteland. Want to become a druglord? Try Altis life. Want to do realism? Arma has that too. Think of Arma 3 as a giant sand box game, that has everything you want, but still contains that military realism.
2417	1	a	gr8 gme, luv gettin sick killz. careful tho, easy 2 die. be safe.
2419	1	a	Hard, and glitchy. Get the hand of it and you'll have fun. Remember, most Arma games aren't complete until about 2 years after release.
2421	1	a	Great game, you should really consider getting it. :)
2423	1	a	Yes with over 20 guns and 12 vehicles I r8 8/8
2425	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, with a great set of multiplayer game modes.
2427	1	a	Playing campaign, get killed by a random mortar shell, restart from last checkpoint, proceed to run 500 meters, get shelled to pieces, repeat.  3/3
2429	1	a	Very interesting and realistic game.  9/10
2431	1	a	One of the Best games this year!!
2433	1	a	this game rock 
2435	1	a	Its a good game.
2437	1	a	I love Arma 3 ....and the game is amazing... but isn't it time for the bugs to get fixed ? I am tired of dying when going down the stairs...getting stuck next to rocks, getting stuck inside of rocks.... not being able to sit/lay down on a big *** flat hills/boulders ....   Release Date: 12 Sep, 2013 .... its almost 2015 ...
2439	1	a	Excellent game - with many, many options.
2441	1	a	Ahh Arma 3... God what a fantastice game Now this game, I would rate it a 7/10. Why you may ask? Here's the reason This game is open world, amazing, physics can be a little wonky, but it gives you such a realistic feeling it's amazing. Want to play with zombies? Go for it, in development but hey, it still counts. Want to roleplay with your friends? Tons of servers waiting for you. While this game isn't exactly optimized for PC in the best way, FPS drops, random crashes, high ping, it is still one hell of a game, go buy it, NOW
2443	1	a	This game is awesome love altis life the most :)
2445	1	a	Great military sim, far better than Arma 2 although there arn't as many vehicles as i liked. Runs better than Arma 2 beacuase of the new engine which allows alot of people to have fun and run smoother. I will be spending alot of time in this game and i recomend it for anyone that actully values a good military battle instead of something like Call Of Duty.
2447	1	a	One of the best simulator games i played!
2449	1	a	Before playing this game you should ask yourself - what military operation would you like to play? Do you want to be a sniper? Do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations? Do you want to ride a tank? Helicopter? Kart? Do you want to be a civilian and simply role-play your wild dreams? Do you want to play as a god? Really, there is not much to be said about ARMA that has not been said - yes, there are bugs, yes it is still a bit laggy, but it gets better. And it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback. You can have hundreds of mods, do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions. It is all up to you. This is main difference between other military shooters - it is a sandbox concept, which means you are buying lot of games in one.
2451	1	a	Its awsome you should try it 
2453	1	a	Best game i have ever played. The Arma series is realy improving from Arma2 to Arma3. The graphics are superb, frame rate is good, overall it still needs some work on campaign and map design. I recently read a post from the mayor of Altis and he said that it 'Turend their peaceful little island into a battleground and that it showed a local buisness factory that is private and secret.' Overall i rate this game a 4 out of 5.
2455	1	a	Me and my friend were driving along in a truck. I asked my friend 'Are there any tanks in ARMA 3?' He replies 'Tanks in this game are like unicorns, you get them if you wish for them.' A minute later we come across a tank parked at the side of the road. 'Hmm did I just get my wish granted?' We get out and inspect the tank. It appears to be not occupied. We turn to leave and hear a sound. Suddenly we are both shot in the back. As I lay there, with my life slowly draining out of me, I see the tank blow up our truck and drive away. 'Goddamm it why did I have to wish for my stupid unicorn!' Then I respawned.  10/10 would wish for unicorn again
2457	1	a	Very good game.. spacial Altis life mod :)
2459	1	a	Really good game, I got addicted as soon as I started to play Altis life and Stratis Wasteland. I just cant stop playing it now!
2461	1	a	Playing Arma 3 in a tactical manner alongside random people you don't know, assigned to different squadrons fulfilling different roles on the battlefield is among the most rewarding multiplayer experiences I've had in gaming in a very long time.  Highly recommended combat sim, immersive and lots of features, combat stances, etc. 9/10
2463	1	a	I only played a little bit. Made my own planes, helicopters and stuff :P
2465	1	a	Do you want to die a lot? Good, 'cuz you will.
2467	1	a	To everyone who enjoyed playing Arma 2 then you would probably like this one. The graphics are a MAJOR upgrade form Arma 2. The only problem now is that there isn't much mods for the game. Not saying its not fun its just that there aren't many mods out for it yet because it was just released. Playing a mission or wasteland with friends is fun and the weapons are very good. The game has scuba divers which are really fun to play as the editor is just like Arma 2's and you can customize a lot. But vehicles, weapons, units, etc. are limited. A problem with this game is that if you have a bad computer or graphics card your game may be laggy and you may have to run it on low settings. I had run mine on high. I reccomend this game to anyone who loves semi realistic games and anyone who likes arma 2. I'd give it a 9/10.
2469	1	a	cool game
2471	1	a	great graphics,sound, solid gameplay for the most part. that aside most def. recommend to get this game.....the game itself is awesome........the mods just add to the experience!
2473	1	a	Great game
2475	1	a	Played Arma2 and Arma2 arrowhead, all i can say it has the same spirit, the same awesomness like the others, maybe for me it's too desert type map, i liked more grass, but there plenty of mods to fix that. And of course Battle Royale + Breaking Point makes it even more playable, and KOTH or Wasteland is still FUN AS HELL! And not to forget about Life mode it's simply amazing MUST TRY!
2477	1	a	Nice if u want to play mods!
2479	1	a	A fantastic military sim which is only restricted by your imagination.
2481	1	a	Flying cars get stuck mid-air, 11/10
2483	1	a	This game is amazing its like 6 or 7 games in one....with all the mods you can play with this game makes this game so worth the money....never have i played a rp shooter but its so epic
2485	1	a	This game is many different ways to play it. This game isnt like COD or Battlefield where the are only very few different ways to play it. COD or battlefield that it just eventually gets old. Arma 3 has a great campaign and it allows you to take matters into your own hands. Arma 3 also has a great multiplayer category to pick from. Arma 3 has a great survival gamemode thats just like DayZ but without zombies. Arma 3 also has gamemodes like capture the flag and deathmatch and a few others but one of the best multiplayer game modes is coop which is really good to play with friends. The greatest thing about arma 3 is that it really allows you to get the feel of what real combat is like and the realism of the game is unbelievably great. If your looking for a game that is really realistic then Arma 3 is probabaly the game you could be looking for.
2487	1	a	best dance simulator in history
2489	1	a	Sometimes It Wont UpDate My Game??
2491	1	a	Very fun, tactical, realistic game. Multiplayer is nice, varitey of gamemodes. Singleplayer is always fun and has a nice storyline! I'd reccomend this to anybody who is thinking about getting Arma 3! Really looking forward to future updates and enhancements! Nice one again Bohemia!
2493	1	a	The best simulation of the military forces,with so many mods who is so fun.
2495	1	a	Absolutely amazing! Now, you will ned a beefy computer to play with graphics that are decent and a framerate that is above 30 FPS, but even on a laptop running it at 20 FPS with the lowest graphics possible, its still HELLA fun to play. One of the best military simulators out on the market.
2497	1	a	best game ever played! is the best real life shooter game you can have!
2499	1	a	Awesome game to play
2501	1	a	Great Game Fun To play This game gives so much online game modes to play you will never be bored :D
2503	1	a	awesome game if played with Friends
2505	1	a	pls add swords to this game.
2507	1	a	This is the best military shooter i have ever played. With the option to download and create content from the workshop you have the option to play this game for ever !!   Only downside is the fact that i need to wait for the campaign but hey enough to do until then !  9/10
2509	1	a	Fantastic game Buy it Now !!!
2511	1	a	Best Army Simulation in entire time then ill play games...wery nice work :)
2513	1	a	Only shooting game in my library that doesn't make me rage when I die. Because in this game, death can be fun as well.  Weird thing to say I know, but when a new pilot takes 20 minutes to get you in the AO then lands the chopper you feel so excited for him only a moment later an enemy aircraft bombs the chopper and your entire squad. I personally can't do nothing but laugh when this happens. :D  10/10  Restored my faith in Bohemia Interactive.
2515	1	a	GREAT GAME VERY CHALLENGING AND REALLISTIC COMBAT NOT FORTHOSE WHO PLAY COD OR BATTLEFIELD.ITS A VERY HARDCORE GAME AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A REAL SOLDIER AND PUTS YOU RIGHT IN THE HEART OF WAR.I LOVE THIS GAME ALOT MORE THAN ANY OTHER SHOOTER OUT THERE I JUST HOPE THERE WILL BE AN ARMA 4 SOMETIME.
2517	1	a	Fantastic game 9/10.  Visuals are amazing on any setting above medium. Style of gameplay is completely up to you. Replayability is infinite. Audio is brilliant. The only downfall is the AI (If you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. It's either they're as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready.  Definitely recommend.
2519	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
2521	1	a	I would definitely recommend this game, if you are in to tactical â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and great graphics. 10/10 stars
2523	1	a	This game is a massive improvement from Arma 2. The gunplay is significantly better, and the map is great. If you like military simulators, look no further!
2525	1	a	this is one of the most badass games i've played in the last 3 years
2527	1	a	Playing this game like it's my job. Really fun, I would pay full price any day of the week.
2529	1	a	The only game where I had a UN Press team try to interview me in the middle of a firefight about the war in Altis.
2531	1	a	An improvement from ArmA 2 in every way.
2533	1	a	Bohemia please code better thx &lt;3
2535	1	a	THIS IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWSOMEEEE!!!!
2537	1	a	Good game to play, single or multiplayer. plenty to do in it.
2539	1	a	battle royal is the best
2541	1	a	ALPHA was very good BETA was kinda bad FULL GAME is crap
2543	1	a	Good game for the $$.
2545	1	a	Atlis Life If You Want No Life.
2547	1	a	Amazing Game, Lots Of money opertunitys if you get good at scripting&gt;.... Tons of server host looking for mission modders!
2549	1	a	This game is still a bit buggy since release but that's to be expected with such a large project. I have a lot of fun playing the campaign but the most fun comes out of the community made gametypes. I definitely reccomend this game!
2551	1	a	This game continues to be one of my favorite games. If you are into survival/fps games this is well worth the try.
2553	1	a	With the new Zeus DLC, I honestly think that the future of RTS is with this game. If you have the hardware to run the game its a must-buy, its the only pc game out there thats actually a full military simulator rather than run and gun fps.
2555	1	a	Probably the greatest FPS game ever created. Completely unlike all other FPS (COD, BF etc) though. Awesome graphics, awesome gameplay and awesome realism.
2557	1	a	it's a cool strategic game if you find the right players and mods...it can go a far way when communitys get there hands on you.
2559	1	a	as long as you have a good pc that can run the game well you are going to have lots of fun
2561	1	a	The community is trash, its a mix of team killing, autism, and milsim faglords making â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ overly complicated. As usual with arma games the optimization is absolute garbage and no matter what you do, you wont hit 60fps consisstantly in online. The guns feel great but have the impact of a pellet rifle, especially the 9mm sidearm NATO gets. The story doesnt make sence but its arma, you dont play it for the singleplayer (i was very disapointed however that the singleplayer was not co-op like in 2). The only way to make this game good is by A) Having a squad that fits you, whether it be autistic milsims, people who are just playing to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around, or a mixture of both, who is in your squad ultimatily deterimines your fun B) MODS MODS MODS MODS. The massive amount of weapon mods spices up the gameplay with familiar faces like the AR platform and ak platform rifles. It makes the game much more realistic ironicly. C) Having lots of patience. Good luck finding a server that is consitantly good that doesnt have faglord admins (Ive been banned for saying 'wat' isntead of 'what', asking someone to turn down their mic, and using opfor weapons while playing as blufor).  6/10, 8/10 with mods  Be advised, when you download mods, even if its something as small as a retexture, you will NOT be able to join 50% of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing servers because arma doesnt like having us filthy modders join vanilla servers. So the servers will be split and you will be getting upset because of the lack of a filter between vanilla only and mod friendly servers.
2563	1	a	A very big improvement from Arma 3, love playing battle royal fits pefectly with the controls. Might want to have a decent pc to not lag on Arma 3 though. If you liked Arma 2, you will love Arma 3!  GET IT ON SALE!!!!
2565	1	a	After recently playing a lot of Arma II, mainly on the game modes 'Island Life' and 'Wasteland' I decided that I absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) I snatched it up right away; and I can tell you I do not regret it a single bit!  Wasteland is a little different to what I was used to on Arma II after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, Zeus is where the game has really caught my attention!  Read up on Zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.
2567	1	a	Nothing like pretending to screw up countries!
2569	1	a	THis game is not like any FPS it delivers skill,Awsomeness, and the best army simulator game out there. I HIGHLY recommend this game. In my view if you dont get Arma your missing half of the greatness in pc
2571	1	a	Best game ever !!! The best OFP you can find.
2573	1	a	amazing game good for pc gamers , fun and liitle bugs here and then but overall good game .
2575	1	a	This game is great, especially with friends, Breaking Point also adds so much to this already amazing game! :D
2577	1	a	Altis Life is dead dont even buy this game.
2579	1	a	Very fun game, I get some fps lag in cities, but overall, its too fun to set down.
2581	1	a	Best game ever 10/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sooooo goood the game is jsut just so awsome and so much fun!
2583	1	a	Very realistic military detail. Accurate radio chatter, sounds, and ballistic mechanics. Use of tactics is vital unlike Call of Duty and that crap where you shoot your way through everything. If you want to immerse your self in a lifelike warzone experience wait till this game is on sale and buy it.
2585	1	a	Good game, much wow. 10/10 would do it again.
2587	1	a	My favorite game of all time its amazing and i certainly recomend everyone to play it. Tell your friends! The only downside about this game is that you need quite a good internet connection for the online multiplayer servers but my connection is great!
2589	1	a	my favorite shooter so much to do and learn its awsome SP pretty good aswel much better MP with a good team and a optimised map/mission
2591	1	a	The most polished, smooth ARMA experience yet and its still in alpha. The upgrade to beta then full release looks like it will only be more content as I have yet to find any bugs. If your an ARMA fan this is a must buy
2593	1	a	cool 
2595	1	a	Play this game or U suck at life
2597	1	a	Arma 3 is a game that is at its best with friends and well made community missions.  -The single player campaign can be difficult for impatient players or someone who is generally 'bad', but a 'good' player will be able to get through it.  -The ingame editor is what gives Arma games the ability to endure, and allows new missions to be made or for weapon testing. However some scripting knowledge (even if its basic) is needed for more dynamic missions. But for some people, 70% of their time may be here.  -Multiplayer can be tricky if you can't find any descent servers to play on or don't know a single friend that is willing to play Arma often.  -The graphics when set to low-standard quality will not look half as good as any other mainstream FPS, but a computer with a descent graphics card and good cpu will have no problem (unless you take the settings to the extreme).  -The Upcoming DLCs and Expansion are hopefully going to add a nice amout of ingame content.  -The modding community itself acts as a hub of occasionally quality addons.  -Current problems that do still exist in Arma 3 however, area the AI; environmental damage physics; and a lack of diversity in each factions arsenal.  -Some pluses for the game are (as mentioned): the communities divotion to the series, the only other game I've personally seen with such a dedicated modding base recently is Skyrim. Another one of the points towards Arma 3 is the maps, not only are they massive in comparision to stock military games, but they also have similar amounts of detail where the developers saw fit. Finally, despite the occasional AI issues, the game really does give players a different experience everytime (once my friend and I fought valiantly against overwhelming odds and lost, we played again and won, again we got wiped immediatly, and again we saw the AI flip their IFV over which was funny (all on the same mission 'Combined Arms')).  *Old (Currently, Arma 3 is a 7/10 but depending on Bohemia's roadmap, Arma 'could' end with a 9/10.)  *New; After Bootcamp and with the Helicopters DLC about to be released (not to mention the Make Arma Not War entries) so far the game is moving along and becoming better as was intended and my score for it has risen from 7/10 to a 8/10.
2599	1	a	Altis Life- Stole a helicopter, Took a man hostage, Landed, Got chased by the police, Got captured, Got charged with Grand theft auto, Evading police and rekless flying and got put in prison for 10 minutes... 10/10 Would take hostage again...
2601	1	a	awesome game! so addictive
2603	1	a	if you like tactical military simulation genre, buy this, try to explore arma world like altis life, wasteland, and many more cant stop play without it 11/10 
2605	1	a	What kind of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this? I downloaded the game and now i have to purchase it?
2607	1	a	I absolutely love this game. And it just keeps getting better so I can only love it more. At first it may seem daunting to dive into and get familiar with. But after a while of playing, getting used to the controls and then learning some of the more advance controls, you can wage an entire war by yourself by commanding squads or with friends by playing cooperatively. With the Steam Workshop you can also find hundreds, if not, thousands of user created missions that are a lot of fun. I personally suggest Dynamic Universal War System for a fun but brutal gamemode that is really good for Co-Op or solo play.
2609	1	a	This is like a drug. Murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. The first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. Some games can be more fun, but none are more real. Sometimes you'll have memories of killing people on certain maps and you'll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. Genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you don't feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to ARMA 3. The sunlight is like video game wizardry i'll never understand. Closing this review i'll say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.
2611	1	a	My initial review said that ArmA 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. I am glad to say that this became true several months before I expected.  Between the incredible Zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like Advanced Gameplay Mod, Task Force Radio and ALiVE this is one of the best co-op games available. You will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but there's really no other game that offers what ArmA does.
2613	1	a	great game
2615	1	a	Let's get something straight right away: I HATE shooters. I've always been the type of guy who likes RPGs and fantasy/sci-fi games. For me, shooters are just too, how to say this, similar for me. Sure, when you first play a shooter you feel engaged in this world where the battlefield comes to life and every action could have an equal and opposite (i.e. death) reaction: it's really fun. But, as I played more and more shooters, they all started to blend together: play the campaign that involves either terrorists in the Middle-East, Russia vs. America, or a black op gone rouge, and once you're completely bored with that, spend hours on end in the multiplayer. There wasn't that exploration, decisions (in regard to gear and strategy), or overall autonomy that many RPGs offered.   Then, I found Arma II. This was one shooter that I absolutely loved, and I easily poured hours into it. The fact you could tackle any mission with any strategy (even going in with no combat appearel), find a server devoted to almost anything (i.e. DayZ, Chenarus Life), and the variety of missions all entranced me, but the main seller for me was the content creator. Never before in ANY game had I been able to create what I wanted to at a moment's notice. Found a mission in the campaign to be unsatisfactory? Just create your own better rendition of it, or even your own original idea from scratch. I had spent days in-game, and when Arma III was announced, you can bet that it was an instant seller for me. When I got it for $60, I was awed by the improved graphics, more introducable interface in the creator, and Workshop content that was amazing.   For the first time in a while, I felt as the battlefield had come alive, and every choice I made had dire consequences. It was like I had played a shooter for the first time, which is a magical feeling. Sure, the campaign may be run-of-the-mill, but you can always make your own mission or even campaign. I do have complaints about some of the physics and glitches, but (1. It does its job, and (2. The game has to load a minumun of 17+ spuare kilometres. In comparison, Grand Theft Auto V had a world size of about 32 miles at most. Arma III's biggest map is 270 km for Pete's sake! I'd be suprised if the game only had twenty known glitches.   All in all, Arma III is worth more than what you pay for it, and is definitely head-and-shoulders above Call of Duty and Battlefield. I saw a picture on the internet that sums up my feelings: 'Command a soldier (image of COD), Command a squad (image of BFF), or command an army or squad or soldier (image of Arma III)'. Too whoever posted that picture: I deeply concur with you!
2617	1	a	So real I got PTSD 
2619	1	a	I shot a 120mm round at a guys knee... I never saw him again 10/10 would recommend
2621	1	a	I bought the game for Altis Life and I have never looked back.
2623	1	a	dont walk across Altis when playing this game...you'll have 30 hours by the time you hit the other side...
2625	1	a	This is an amazing game. king of the hill is a fun sector control game. but he cake is given to the Breaking Point Zombie Mod. At only a mod of a few months already better then Day Z SA.
2627	1	a	Arma 3 is an awesome game that I play often
2629	1	a	Great Game nothign else to say, Its really fun to play with friends
2631	1	a	Got killed by a naked man carring a .50cal. 10/10
2633	1	a	I recommend this game only if my brother, Tommy plays it. :)
2635	1	a	If you want to drive BAD â™¥â™¥â™¥ TANKS, JETS, OR HELICOPTERS THAT ARE ALL ARMED TO THE TEETH buy this game, if you want Fun cooperative gameplay and tactical, realistic fire fights, buy this game. The realism is insane, from actually needing a First aid kit to treat a wound, to having to find parts to repair a vehicle this game is sweet!
2637	1	a	damn this is good
2639	1	a	Best Game to Waste Money one period
2641	1	a	Fantastic, only issue i have are the overly complex controls.
2643	1	a	if you are looking for a harcore tactical pc gmae. Look no further arma 3 is the shizzle
2645	1	a	I recommend this game if its on sale, but if it isn't, its not really worth 49.99 euro. But it's still fun andreally great looking.
2647	1	a	a must have game
2649	1	a	wud reccommend 10/10 wud sex this game
2651	1	a	this is an awesome game very fun to play with friends,great graphics, worth the price
2653	1	a	This game has everything! 9/10
2655	1	a	This game is highly recommended if you want a real Military Simulation. This is not going to be your average call of duty or battlefield fps. If you want a real military experience here it is. This game has great graphics, AI can be a little annoying but you will get use to it, and there are lots of vehicles and weapons to choose from. I hope you buy this game, you will not make a mistake.
2657	1	a	To be honest ArmA 3 alone is good but the community mods for it are really what makes the game come alive in the mil sim community! Once you go ArmA you will never go back.
2659	1	a	Rammed into a jet at the Arfield with a Hunter going 100 km/h Flew 1.8 KM from the Airfield in a blown up Hunter.  Rated Game: 10/10   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=398382783 
2661	1	a	Thought about buying this for a long time. Arma 2 was great, but i wasnt sure if this was any good. If you haven't played Arma 3, buy it now. You wont believe what kind of situations occur there.
2663	1	a	Its a real war!!!!!
2665	1	a	Best game I have ever played
2667	1	a	It's a good game ! ( OverPoch to dayz mod is so awesome ! ) BEST BUY
2669	1	a	its the best game ever i want all to buy it
2671	1	a	Best games ive played in awhile.
2673	1	a	An Alright game, I recommend ArmA II: Combined operations over this.
2675	1	a	Blow up a cop car full of cops, get arrested with a 180k load out, get detained by a police officer, jump out the car every time he gets in, make him get very pis sed off, get away with a 85k ticket and keep all your guns. 1000000 / 0.1 IGN 'Would pi ss off cops again' TwiisT 2016
2677	1	a	So, after 1206 hours I have to say: I hate you and I love you but I still hate you.  I played every ARMA title and the one thing that never changes is the broken gameplay. Bigger Maps? Yep. Nice graphics? You got it. New thingies and stuff? Kinda, here you go.  BUT you still hang in doorframes, start levitating on balconies and egdes, you can't enter a room smoothly, the ballistics are simply â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t at times, your character does every action soooooooo slooooow, servers with 3rd person are absolutely useless because people just sit behind walls seeing you without exposing themselfs and shoot you in the back, the weapons sway is outraging (I am a former soldier and no one except a halfspastic baboon during an epileptic episode would be THIS all over the place), the body armor is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t in its durability and it extends into uncovered areas (I always aim into the hips but it makes no difference to hitting the center of the chest where the lvl IV would sit), they FINALLY implemented bipods and weaponresting but they did a worse job than all the community-mods for this and older ARMA titles...I could go on and on. And if you play King of the Hill or something like this, your framerate will drop right trough the floor no matter what specs you have.  It's a good game, the best there is because there is no other like it. And that's probably why the devs don't really care about optimising it or getting rid of all these bugs and inconveniences that have been a trademark of ARMA since the start. I would love to have a game with half the graphics and more realistic details like proper dimension and ballistics of body armor, not poking out of every wall with parts of my body, entering a room without hanging on 50 points of the door or getting pushed into the wall by it.....the bugs are so many and they are soooooo old and stupid.  And after going into the whole DLC-pay-for-it (marksmen was absolutely not worth it by content) they now even come up with a new map that must be bought seperately. I wager the same bugs will be in there, the same old crap, but the graphics will be nice.  I like ARMA and I really try to overlook it's shortcomings but it becomes so annoying. I bought the Marksmen DLC against better knowledge and I will definately not buy any other DLC.
2679	1	a	If you are after the best war game, look no further. ARMA3 is it:)
2681	1	a	if you are looking for a REAL army simulator, then you're on the right place arma 3 is the best army simulator experience you ever wanted with a good story line and the freedom to choose to do everything you want, there are no straight checkpoints, you aint going to be shooting at a enemy for 2 hours one bullit could kill you depends on where you get shot.  this is straight away just the best militairy game ever made you have the freedom to do everything with the content creator.   the only question you should ask yourself is.. why did it took so long to have this game!!!   it's worth the money. especially with online multiplayer on a big map with the freedom to do anything with anyone.  see you in the battlefield!
2683	1	a	Very Good game with endless amout of fun and action will the mod support
2685	1	a	Well lets see where to start, this game is by far one of the best FPS simulator heavily moddable game that I have ever played. It's extremely addicting and to be honest if anyone in game is ever rude, you can shoot them in their face with a .50 cal behaviour Modification round =). I adore this game at first I had no intention of ever playing it due to ArmA 2 being something I was completely used too and having read bad reviews I was reluctant. This game was gifted to me and ever since I tried it, well lets just say the people who wrote the bad reviews obviously lack the intellectual capacity to flip on a light switch. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves FPS.
2687	1	a	Fun open world game. A lotof mods to choose from. Well worth the money
2689	1	a	Large scale multiplayer warfare. Best war simulation ever.
2691	1	a	I have owned this game for a long period of time (since alpha) but never played it that much seeming as I never played with anyone however this February 2014, I have had a blast playing with a few friends; demonofsparks and theavengedkoala. Wasteland is a fantastic game mode and I could not believe the time I was spending playing this. We all started playing at 10am and before we know it, it was 7pm. The time flew, especially when we are building/protecting our base, sneaking to the gun shop, stealing weapon caches, flying heli's and aircraft aswell as crashing into little stones on the road and your car completely blowing up. This truly is a very fun game - even if the price is steep. So buy this game and I will see you in the wasteland!
2693	1	a	best teamplay game i ever seen :)  15/10  +Graphic +Singleplayer +Multiplay &lt;3
2695	1	a	It's pretty cool
2697	1	a	war simulator flight simulator life simulator tank simulator racing simulator? or just enjoy the view. THIS GAME PUSHES IT TO THE LIMIT GRAPHICALLY. (considering you can handle it) very worthwhile experiences.
2699	1	a	really nice game
2701	1	a	Well Im pretty new to Arma. I have all of them but never played because of the difficulty curve. I've been palying Epoch mod lately and its fun. Just unsure of what exactly to do besides see people and kill them. I know theres basebuilding and missions but I have yet to figure either of those 2 out. Its a very in-depth military simulator and should prob not be bought by COD or Battlefield players as its much different than those 2. I will spend more time playing and getting to know the game. Its pretty great so far.  A/V = 8.5 / 10 Gameplay = 9 / 10 Learning Curve = High
2703	1	a	were do I start. this is the best military game I have ever played. most of the gameplay is about the infantry but there are tanks and jets. and if you like call of duty or battlefeld its not really like them missions last hours not 10 minutes over all a pretty good game
2705	1	a	Amazing game a must have for all steam users and FPS lovers
2707	1	a	just a really good game
2709	1	a	This game isn't comparable to the simple minded Call of Duty, or Battlefield. It's much different, more complicated and dynamic, however that's what makes this game so ridiculously fun to play. The sheer diversity of this game, including mods and custom campaigns from Steam Workshop makes this game replayable for what seems an eternity.   ArmA 3 provides what ArmA 2 has, and even more, with better graphics, gameplay, controls and detail. Don't let the absurd metascore of 74/100 turn you away (Metacritic are idiots who only use 5 minutes of gameplay to rate a game, unless they're paid otherwise. Come at me Metacritic.) This game deserves much better reception than it has.  A solid game for a solid player, ArmA 3 will provide hours upon hours of entertainment for a first person shooter (or an RTS player) who are looking for a game that requires more skill and organisation to play.  Some of the best mods and game modes available for ArmA 3 are;  -Zeus (The official ArmA 3 RTS combat mode) combines an RTS experience from the eyes of a God, to the FPS experience from a player on the ground, adapting to dynamic situations created by the God.  -PLAYERUNKNOWN'S Battle Royale (Effectively the 'Hunger Games' of ArmA) Battle out over a small island, loot military camps and towns for weapons, and battle to the death as the game area gets smaller and smaller, last man standing wins!  -ArmA 3 Wasteland (Sandbox combat) Stockpile weapons, vehicles and aircraft, build your base with a team and battle between 3 factions with up to 80 players for control over airfields, bases, and objectives to win the game!  -Breaking Point (ArmA 3 DayZ) A zombie survival based off DayZ for the ArmA 3 maps - Stratis and Altis  and many others!  Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah I do.
2711	1	a	Its Ok, Not spent much time on it though.
2713	1	a	Best military simulator I have ever played. Highly reccomend especially if your going to be playing wiht friends.
2715	1	a	Best game in Universe, 10 iluminati of 10
2717	1	a	This is a game in which your each step you need to think about every moment of this game just etched in my memory. The game is worthy of respect, and play with friends in Arma 3 - is priceless. 10 out of 10.

2719	1	a	Love this game, Great realistic military simulator. Complex yet easy to learn. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the military, firstperson-shooters, and action games.
2721	1	a	this game is the top military simulation (it is the only one). only problem for this game is : you must have high end pc for standard to high graphic for ultra graphic seting require lot more than high end pc. the game work on ultra until you dont start masive fights with tanks and helicopter and hell on screen. Then the engine show his weak points. it is not optimized for this, In game like cod and battlefield you will play at max setting at 120 fps, but here goes from 90 to 19. but this game is not only on franatic action and who will have more head shoots and kills. Here is all about teamwork, how to stay alive in war, in cordinating actions, comunicating with team, making right choices at right time. Here one good mission take 2h at least to complete if first you dont get bullet and you even didnt see enemy. this game is war and all about the war and military life. it is not for cod generations... they will be very frustrating in game like this. here you use brain, pace and time and military skill will be useful.   This game need update on engine and how he work on massive battle. LOD optimization and few fixes. But guys work all the time on this matter. Arma receve all the time smol and big patches. Updates on sound, weapon handling, graphic problems, and community does great work for this game, tons of new item vehicles, maps, mission campains and all work in mp.   What definitly need a big update and fix is terrain builder and other tools for making maps and mission.   for game i give 8/10 need more optimization only that is problem here..   content official and community 10/10  for editor 5/10 need a lot more work and better setup, guide and documentation... too long learning curve, hard to make decent maps without help from youtube and lots of forums reading and searching.....
2723	1	a	This is the best game for anyone who likes military games but is tired of games like Call of Duty. This is my favorite game and i will keep playing it.
2725	1	a	Definitely a step up from ArmA 2
2727	1	a	played it abit, its ok
2729	1	a	Amazing game with much to do and many mods... ARMA, naver fails to Amuse me :)
2731	1	a	I would highly recommend this game to any mil-sim lovers out there.
2733	1	a	I've always been a fan of the Arma series, right the way back to Cold War Assault.  Arma 3 is a brilliant step forward, and there are some good improvements since Arma 2, which I was very happy with. I am able to play this on my laptop (HP Pavilion g6, Intel Core i3) and the graphics are very good. I would like to upgrade to be able to enjoy the higher end graphics. However this game is still incredibility realistic.  Overall, very enjoyable, very realistic, and lots of fun!
2735	1	a	Same ole Arma, if you enjoy the series, its worth a buy. Active multiplayer community
2737	1	a	This game is extremly good. I recomend it to anyone that like roleplaying games.
2739	1	a	Best and most realistic Military Simulator. I died so many times so i quit. But its fun and i am a newbie
2741	1	a	This is by far my favorite game. Once you get out of the altis life and dayz player bases you will find alot of communities dedicated to playing tacticaly. Then there are the mods. You have addons that add maps, weapons, vehicles, and even full conversion mods like AGM and ACE3 that change the whole game and add affects like wind, and advanced medical systems. In short if you are looking to play a realistic military shooter with people who are serious about playing Tacticaly then arma 3 is the game for you.
2743	1	a	very chill war simulation
2745	1	a	i love arma 3 its the best game ever
2747	1	a	This is game for the real men!
2749	1	a	This game requires a good pc, my pc is a decent pc with a brand new graphics card and it is still struggling a little to run this game but, it is deffinitaly a good game.
2751	1	a	It's a game.
2753	1	a	...
2755	1	a	Fun game, all the mods make it so fun to play.
2757	1	a	this game is awsome, if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get, then this game has your name writen all over it. you need communication, team work, and strategy to win, lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow!
2759	1	a	If its on sale buy it, if the dlc are on sale too buy the marksmen one but dont pay full price :/
2761	1	a	Great game! Would recommend to anyone who loves to play war games. 10/10 Would buy again.
2763	1	a	Best War Simulator ever! Fans of ArmA 2, if you are fan of modern, not futuristic combat, you can still enjoy this game! With the arsenal of mods coming to it at the moment, it will soon go back from 2035 to 2014. Still, the Vanilla game is great too. The first 2 campaign episodes are great but the third one lacks of depth. I strongly recommend it to experienced ArmA fans. (Please kids, don't buy this and infect our gameplay! This game is made for mature war sim fans.)
2765	1	a	I met my first boyfriend through a match. We met after and had hot, tasteful anal. My â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ creamed with the force of a thousand Ron Pauls as he pulled his thick, greasy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Oh, the game is fun also.
2767	1	a	Can't join any servers anymore. 10/10 wouldn't join again!
2769	1	a	played made owned servers of all kinds awesome game a mic is a must have for life servers
2771	1	a	Get this game...Hands down amazing
2773	1	a	I have over 1500+ hours on this game...Thats all I have to say
2775	1	a	great fun. make sure u have friends to paly with ;)
2777	1	a	Can be awesome if you can get ahold of some of the great mods AND a good group of folks to play MP with. Other than that, you probably won't have much fun.   I've been playing ARMA titles since Operation Flashpoint came out.
2779	1	a	Great graphics, but there is still alot that can be improved! I recommend this game.
2781	1	a	fckn aye m8, been shootin 'em Ã¦nemies with me carbine aw yee woman
2783	1	a	Great gome to play with mates online and you have a thrilling singlr player too.
2785	1	a	Sooo good! Much play, much enjoyment!
2787	1	a	  'Arma 3, definitely one of the best games I've ever played!'    Next to the game 'Assassins Creed III' is 'Arma 3' truly one of the best games I've ever played, and it is definitely worth the money! It has a lot of features and a huge amount of possibility's. I've played it for almost 70.0 hours now, and I only played in the editor for now, I didn't even started the campaign yet.  First I thought that there whould be a huge difference between Arma 2 and Arma 3, but besides the grahpics (which are amazing) and the campaign, the game is almost the same as it's previous version. However the makers of Arma 3 did a great job by improving all the gameplay experiences and possibility's,   Some changes between Arma 2 and Arma 3:  - Customise your weapons. - Customise your player, like changing clothes and more. - Submarine and swimming underwater/diving suits. - Amazing improved graphics.  But there are also some dissapointing things,  In Arma 3 I really missed some airplanes and ships. However, I'm using some modifications right now like the 'USS Nimitz' and the 'F/A-18 Super Hornet'. Those modifications really make the game  more than perfect.   A game like Arma 3 for just â‚¬44,99,- is just amazing, and will never be a waste of money, and time. It really one of the best games ever made, and you won't have much problems while playing.    10/10, AMAZING GAME!  
2789	1	a	Awesome game. Worth the money if you like strategic shooters.
2791	1	a	For a Military Game/Sim this is looking second to none. Huge Enviroment mixed with almost limitless posibilities. From a modding point of view this game is INSANE. Not only does it have an intuitive Editor but also a dedicated community providing a stream of free content which is now managed via the workshop part of steam. a must have for any Immersive/RPG gamer.   Next Stop Altis.
2793	1	a	shot a guy in a helicopter  11/10 ign best game of the year
2795	1	a	It has a play style for everyone, except for call of duty players. I definently recommend buying this when its on sale as there is no other game in the market like this!!!!
2797	1	a	I wanted to rewrite my review, since my prior review didn't give this game justice, and honestly makes made me look 8 when I wrote it. First off this game is amazing in the right mind set, you need to enjoy running 3 km, and then dying to someone 1km away, its can be a pain, but its fun if you now how to play. I love the aspect that you can create and play your own missions, and I think this really can bring a community together. One of the biggest aspects that make this game as big as it is modding, Dayz was the biggest breakthrough in modding for Arma 2 and it created a whole new chapter in Arma, and what it would become. There is so many mods you can play such as A3L, Dayz, Wasteland, Dom, Battle Royale, And those are just a few mods that the community could create  My Pros and Cons:  Pros:  Great Community Modding SinglePlayer  COOP Missions Weekly Updates Good DLC  Cons:  Terrible FPS Anti Cheat is flawed Servers tend to not show up Joining on friends is a pain  Things I'd like to see.  I'd like to see a COOP aspect added to singleplayer, playing alone is kinda boring at times.  Ability to turn off fatigue in single player, The AI's tend to get ahead since fatigue can really mess your player up.  Fixing Fps, This has been a recurring issue in Arma games, the fps is terrible (You can check my specs, its not my computer) I hope this gets fixed soon, but I don't have much hope.
2799	1	a	highly addictive with lots of content, worth every penny
2801	1	a	  Is Arma 3 worth it?
2803	1	a	a very nice game 99 out of 100 for me a nice game its very easy to learn the basic controls but to learn all of them you have to invest alot of time in it i play it till the alpha and the fun is remain the only thimg are some bugs and hackers who dont get banned and hacking the servers for example they destroy all the vehicles on the map or something like this this sucks a little bit but at all its fun to play it
2805	1	a	ArmA rating as a game-6/10 ArmA rating as a sandbox-11/10 
2807	1	a	Amazing, best shooter I have ever played.
2809	1	a	This game has ups and downs. The up is that Arma has a huge modding database. Com is that you need a good peice of hardware to run it. Overall I recommend this game just for it's realism and simulation.
2811	1	a	One of the best Mil-Sim games out there! You like shooting, flying, driving, blowing stuff up or just taking in the scenery; this game is sure to suprise. Plus there are several great mods and missions to explore.
2813	1	a	This is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i did everthing that you can possiably imagine in Arma 3
2815	1	a	The best war simulation game out there. You can do pretty much anything. The numerous mods and user created contect only make the game even better.
2817	1	a	Arma 3 is a great open game with a lot of posibilities and things to do. Game modes such as Altis Life or Wasteland are fun yet challenging, but can also be quite frustrating. The servers always have a great staff to help out in case you need to report someone or just need help with the server.
2819	1	a	This game is well worth the money, I can out countless hours of my time playing this. So far a good choice as I love playing Atlis life all the time.. and King Of The Hill.. Hopefully you can enjoy the game as much as I do.
2821	1	a	Arma tree
2823	1	a	I get to play it for three minutes before it crashes    10/10 IGN
2825	1	a	This game is 10/10 worth getting nothing will go to waste on this game. If you get board of some of the game types you get mods to play never ends.
2827	1	a	its good
2829	1	a	It's pretty neat stuff. I find it to be a pretty big improvement from Arma 2
2831	1	a	Battle simulator like no other. It is as realistic as possible. Massive modding options, which gives many different game options. Want real warfare simulation? You have it. Want faster more like BF gaming style? Go with King of the hill game mode. Want to fly, shot people with tanks, coordinate strategy? You can choose all that and more.
2833	1	a	this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing best so get it peeps 
2835	1	a	Without a doubt the best milsim-game ever made.
2837	1	a	.
2839	1	a	Something between Americas Army and Battlefield, this game gives me what i need regarding realism and graphic design. The performance on custom missions definitely needs improvement - sadly, nothing seems to be happening anymore. Either way, i recommend!
2841	1	a	Nice slideshow. Better than anything i could make on powerpoint. A*
2843	1	a	this game would be advisable to play with friends as gives you a more realistic feel to the game.
2845	1	a	High quality stuffs.
2847	1	a	It's the most accurate, realistic(apart from wildlife in the game) and versatile military simulator I've ever let my eyes on. I will even go that far to say it's the best military simulator that man has ever made...
2849	1	a	What can I say? I've been with Bohemia Interactive since 2001 when Operation Flashpoint was born. If you think Day Z or Arma has been laggy, how do you think I felt when I played OFP on a P4 800 Mhz processor with a 1 GB of RAM? Since the release of the latest update, the long awaited 'fire your weapons from vehicles' has emerged and Arma 3 has moved one step closer towards it's completion.   As for the DLC, first it was karts, then helicopters. The next installment is scheduled for Q1 of 2015 that will feature an enhancement for marksmen.   But, that does not go without saying that Arma 3 will ever see a final update, for the game is very community oriented and new improvements are found each and every day.  If you are a fan of any sort of realistic gameplay regarding war or vehicle physics, then Arma 3 is for you. Nothing excites me more than loading up a Blackhawk to it's gills and entering a combat zone with my friends and other real players only to delve out utter mayhem and destruction to our enemy.   Arma 3 is my favorite game, and if you give it a chance and are patient with it's occasional shortcomings, then get on board and let's annihilate some targets!
2851	1	a	best milsim on the market
2853	1	a	Great Military Sim. That being said, way too many people under 18 which really hurts the maturity level of the game. Lots of stupid stuff to deal with in Player Vs. Player. Ovearll I would recommend to anyone looking for a realism many other FPS can't give you.
2855	1	a	It's worth &lt;#
2857	1	a	Arma has always been in my mind after i bought arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead. theres a lot of features u cant get in other games than arma 3 so 9/10 would put my money in to this!
2859	1	a	Best game I ever bought 10/10 love it :)
2861	1	a	By far one of the greatest sims I've ever played, I'm unable to join the military but this is what I think it would feel like, a must buy!
2863	1	a	this game rocks!
2865	1	a	You can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ foot around with 13 year olds that want to do your mom when playing CoD or Battlefield games. When you want to step up to a man's FPS, strap yourself in to Arma 2 or 3, and join an Arma community. Be treated like a man.
2867	1	a	This might seem incredibaly dull and difficult, but after the frst time you and group of friends get pinned down in a village while in convoy, and your friend expertly lands a Hummingbird right in the street and you all pile in while round whizz past your heads, and you soar into the air to safety, its almost indescribable (especially since the whole thing is unscripted). It can be one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming, but its what you make of it. Don't be expect to hop in and instantly enjoy yourself. The game only gives you the tools, and you make what you want with said tools.
2869	1	a	Well arma 3 is a great game really realistic BUT after you play 400 hrs+ it gets REALLY boring.     Still would get it.....  great game great graphics  .....................................................................................................................................................................................
2871	1	a	this game is the best military simulator ive ever played
2873	1	a	Have you ever felt like running 4km with 40kg of gear only to get shot from 1km away? Have you ever felt like balancing 24 different factors before firing a single shot in an FPS? Have you ever felt like knifing noobs just doesn't cut it anymore? (pun intended) If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may need treatment in the form of Arma 3, an open-world, simulation FPS. Arma 3 (short for Arma 3) is the crux of over a decade of refinement by one of the most dedicated development teams out there - and it shows. Visually, it is stunning (of course depending on specs), aurally it is surreal, and when it comes to RPing and simulation, there is no better option (except maybe VBS made by the same people; but that costs $$$$$ and is used by actual armies so yeah maybe not...). Need more incentive? As well as a dev team that updates news for the fan base weekly and is STILL improving the game (and plans to continue doing so), there is also the modding commmunity for Arma - which is second to none. Arma 3 can literally be anything you want it to be - even a taco. 11/10 would die 12,008 times again.
2875	1	a	This is a fantastic combat sim that has as much or as little depth and complexity as you would like. It's a shooter for grownups. Going back to COD et al will seem like a big step down to an arcade shooter. The learning curve is fairly steep with all sorts of key bindings and responsibilities, but boy is it satifying when you actually achieve something.   Great game.
2877	1	a	good game but not for bad pcs good for gaming pcs it runs fast for me i recommend this game
2879	1	a	This game will redefine 'Easy' as 'Hard'.  But it's also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome, and has some baller mods and great devs.
2881	1	a	ArmA III is an amazing game by itself, but when you start trying out some of the community mods that is when you really see it's potential. Mods like Altis Life, King of the Hill, Epoch, Overpoch and so many more turn this one game into an entire game bundle w/ plenty of different game styles. I have been in the ArmA community for years and have contributed whenever I can. I love the game, love the community &amp; love the new CQ Mod for Arma 3 set to release very soon! My opinion on the CQ Mod may be a bit biast considering i'm on the dev team, but i still know a good mod when i see one. Check it out for yourself; CQ Mod Gameplay video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wEUajuUqDY   CQ Mod Armory Selection System  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU1KSAjHaIM  
2883	1	a	10/10
2885	1	a	What's not to like about a true military tachtical First Person Shooter. ARMA 3 delivers a excellent game that does just that. This is not your typical run around killing spree like most FPS games lead people to beleive. With it's extensive maps, ARMA 3 gives gamers a vast variety of landscapes, dynamic scenery including day to night trasistions. In ARMA 3 you need to slow it down and take your time or your self dead with no chance to respawn. NO RESPAWN? that's right, realism is a real as it gets. But don't worry, respawns can and do exist. But sometimes it's better to wait for a medic, if one is available. Trust me when I tell you that ARMA 3 is as real as it can get.
2887	1	a	In Arma 1-2, you can crawl, walk, run and now in Arma 3 you can swim... Yet you still can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing jump. 8/10. Would be 10/10 if you could jump.
2889	1	a	If I got stuck with one game only in my library it is this. The possibilities it offers and the community that support it make it a winner.  That said it has it's issues. Needs a strong CPU and decent to perform very well, going against the rule of thumb in modern pc gaming. Additonally there are lots of bugs and issues that still need address. Unfortunately a lot of them have existed in previous titles too. There is positive development progress all the time though.  Arma 3 aims for and achieves something which no other game does.
2891	1	a	Im not one for writing Reviews, but i have to admit, that Arma 3 is one of my Favourites thus far, As with any Modern Day FPS game, this has alot of differences, It has Realism, The Ai respond to your actions, Be it through Stealth or wrecklessness ((Apologies for my spelling)) You have to work as a Team on countless objectives, This game is a Must for all those FPS Simulation Nerds who long for this sort of thing, It is also best played with friends, But the one drawback to which i find annoying every now and then, Is the Frame drops in certain Areas, Much like Arma 2's Chernarus Map ((which i played 05 Superpowers with friends religiously)) Does render Gameplay a little, But overall, A definate worthwhile game to play, Reccommended Throughout.  10/10 Will Die and Die again XD
2893	1	a	This game is amazing, so far its the best game all around I have played. It has amazing graphics, lots of differant simulations, and endless replay value. The main campaign is not part of the game at launch, but is a free DLC in 3 differant installments.  The fact you can play this game in first or third person, increases the amount of people this game can apeal to.   The learning curve is a little rough, but after a few times running around doing missions or just playing around, its super easy to pick up.  AGAIN graphics, A++ if you dont have this game yet, its worth the money, I got the game during alpha, I got one for my wife in Beta, and now the full games out, and it just blows alpha and beta away with how amazing the game turned out to be.  
2895	1	a	Jumped in a 3 foot gap, broke my leg and died instantly.  IGN: 11/10
2897	1	a	A fantastic game, easy to get into, difficult to master. Best tactical combat game out there, bar none.
2899	1	a	Amazing Game! Defintitely would recomend! Expecially during summer sale!
2901	1	a	Arma 3 Is the modern combat simulation of 2013-2014. Actually that was a lie. Arma 3 is anything you want it to be. A First Person Shooter. A Role Playing game... Arma 3 fits all genres. If you want something and have the means to make it. You can. All because of the new Arma 3 Engine. Personaly I think Arma 3 knocks Battlefield &amp; Call Of Duty off the board. Even if most people think the faces on Arma 3 look like total crap compared to other shooters on the market. Graphics don't matter, it's the content of the game that's most important. Plus Arma 3 is open world. No scripts, no dumb game barriers, no seeing through walls crazy AI's. Everyone's game expirence is different depending on their actions. I mean Arma 3's Maps like Altis and Stratis are just plain MASSIVE! I 100% reccomend buying this game regardless of the type of computer you have. Well obviously you need to meet minimal requirements to even play the game. Also people who have Intel HD Graphic's Mobile. You may face some difficulties. Get Ready To See Real Warfare.
2903	1	a	This game is cool
2905	1	a	This is one of the best games i have ever played!!!
2907	1	a	Don't bother playing in Multipayer if you have bad Internet connection ,
2909	1	a	nvm this game is pretty cool with friends
2911	1	a	loving the epoch servers... check out  doubletap.com 
2913	1	a	This game is great. Unlike most modern shooters, Arma 3's engine and combat mechanics are complete poop. This leaves the most strategic player the victor instead of the player with the best twitch reflex. Rewarding strategy over reflex in a FPS is refreshing.
2915	1	a	This game is pretty bad.
2917	1	a	The closest you can get to a battlefield without putting yourself in danger.
2919	1	a	Awesome only if you play it with friends
2921	1	a	Used way too much time on this game. It's so good.
2923	1	a	better then pizza crust 
2925	1	a	Awesome Game. Love the milsim side of it. Even if its very bare-bone, the mods are what make this game great. Also the fact that the armored vehicles for the NATO troops are Israeli makes the game way more interesting since its not the same old American armor. Only bad part is the little kids that always talk in global extra loud :|  10/10 Bohemia :D
2927	1	a	Meh. It's okay.
2929	1	a	Great game. I bought this after playing DayZ standalone and having never played the DayZ mod or Arma 2. The most realistic combat game I ever played. A must have. 9/10
2931	1	a	Got banned from my favourite server because of accidentally using voice chat in global... &lt;3 10/10
2933	1	a	ARMA 3 IS A GREAT GAME BUT NEED SOME FIX BUGS IN THE GAME
2935	1	a	love this game!
2937	1	a	Difficult to master but awesome to play. Realistic army sim.
2939	1	a	I don't even own this game. 10/10 i'd play it again
2941	1	a	Umm I dont have this game but I can still review it. 10/10 would review again
2943	1	a	There we were, a band of brothers, enlisted in the US Army. It was me, the quiet but serious medic the RPG guy who loved his rocket launcher more than his wife and spoke highly of it in area chat the wise joke cracking rifleman who couldn't resist a good pun the russian with broken english who sniped so much you could of thought he was vasily zaytsev the kind hearted squad leader who left no man behind and treated everyone as an equal and the slow learning new machine gunner with a laugh that touch the soul
2945	1	a	It is the most wonderfull game/simulator that i have ever played. It has a fantastic engine, but it still needs some things. There are mods for this game tha should be apart of the original content. But with that said, mods are always available. 9/10 for me x)
187	0	a	This game serves as a textbook example of why graphics are not more important than mechanics. Any game that has to be modded to achieve a basic level of playability is a failed project by any measure. If you just was a mission editor or multiplayer, that's fine. But to not buy this for the campaign. You will spend nealry half of your playtime loading from a save after dying because of something completely out of your control. For example, I spent the past hour doing just that after my team would not follow a simple 'move' command and an enemy MRAP nearly a kilometer out spotted us, and killed all of us with two salvos from it's HMG. Spend your $60 on something better if you're looking for a single-player experience.
2947	1	a	what's arma
2949	1	a	This isn't optimized, So you're gonna run it in low graphics if you want fps. But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it, This is arma, one of the best games of simulation that exists. Nothing better than put a guillie suit on and hunt 'dears' They simply don't get where the shot came from. It really doesn't add up to them 'cause they think they're invulnerable, they actually aren't.... Helicopters, tanks, snipers and whatnot will hunt you, but if you're evil at your class in this case sniper, They'll not find you, They'll fear you, hate you and hunt you back...Not to mention you can add mods to it, which make it better. I'm biased to say this 'cause my favorite style of playing is sniper but... Now back to its cons, The biggest failing of this game in my opinion is not being optimized 'cause there's no excuse for that, you know there's a myriad of games with huge maps that are optimized and you can clock them easily. Hope the company that's made this game come out an update to optimize it, or at least optimize the next arma. You know if you guys really do it, the next arma should be named 'the revolution of wars' Get it? The revolution of wars(Fps) Nevermind. After all, Awesome game!!
2951	1	a	First time playing Arma 3. Launch and join an RP server. Meet a cop who's very helpful since I'm still working out the controls. Buy a car and don't know how to unlock it. When finally get in the car, get rammed into and kidnapped by two strangers. Strangers hold me at gunpoint then shoot me in the head.  10/10 would be a hostage again.
2953	1	a	Great game, fun to play however Badly optimised but i recomend getting it for fun
2955	1	a	Having almost 700 hours played in this game, I would reccomend it to anyone trying to get away from the average FPS and get into something that actually gets your heart pumping. Tactics and wetting yourself as you hear a bullet crack by your ear or running face to face with an enemy nothing compares!
2957	1	a	great game, mainly play it with mods, exile ect
2959	1	a	250 hours and I still haven't experienced a properly functioning game. ;) 10/10 would glitch again
2961	1	a	Arma 3 is a well developed, well made game. It has great graphics with ultra realistic mechanics but this game can be extremely difficult to get used to. If you put a lot of time into improving your abillity at the game it will pay off. Although it has its flaws. This is a good realistic combat game.
2963	1	a	very nice game
2965	1	a	Best War-sim EVER. Great fun when u have a squad going :)
2967	1	a	+Many sandbox modes from the community that ar every well done +very good game overall  -the damage model -you lose magazines randomly sometimes  (usually in vanilla servers)
2969	1	a	played - battle royale, altis life, arma 3 life, KOTH, campaign, wasteland, exile, breaking point. would reccomend a lot if you think your PC can run it.  there is a couple problems that cant really be fixed easily in my opinion but i'd say but overall a pretty solid game.
2971	1	a	set in 2030, hear the cry operation magnitude nato in europe eastern armies with their guns eastern, eastern, eastern armies with their guns   iran, you would too,  its a shooter game
2973	1	a	.
2975	1	a	ArmA has come a long way from the days of Operation Flashpoint and it shows here. ArmA 3 can only be what your imagination is limited too, with many different game mods, servers galore and regular updates to both for what can only be a massive community of gamers.  In ArmA 3 it is completely okay to play the game how you see fit, from behind iron sights taking cover behind a row of rocks or from 1km away looking down the glass of a .50Cal, you might be a medic and you've made it to your patient but now your out of life saving items; the tactics are incredible and the smoke has real effect but be careful because it works both ways and you may be flanked with amazing efficiency.  Are you a pilot? or Diver? Perhaps you might get enjoyment out of servicing other players ensuring that they are upto date and fully stocked with the stuff they need for their mission, whilst someone out is calling for a Casavac/Medivac or a gun run to help out the ground troops.  This game is what you make out of it and has endless possibilities within the vanilla game and thousands of modifications for free... Try it out, reach out to strangers play how you want, when you want, as what ever class of soldier you want.  ArmA 3 the game of possibilities 9.8/10
2977	1	a	Love this damn game! Too many hours, can't wait for more updates!
2979	1	a	Game has good fps value, but physics like jumping off a 5 foot building could kill you. You also can die from glitching through walls and the ground and happens often and the multiplayer have some hackers and kids and physics are very not balenced like helicopters sliding down a small slope and tipping over quickly. Don't forget to watch out driving too because if you so mistakenly hit a 'wire fence' the whole car gets ruined. Lastly there needs to be a option to fix the mic INGAME!
2981	1	a	I killed a guy because he had a cool hat.   10/10 Took the hats of his comrades as war trophies.
2983	1	a	55555
2985	1	a	This is a great game it combines a bit of the ACE mod DayZ loadout vibe and great graphics!
2987	1	a	I heavily recommend Arma 3 as the best first and third person shooter.  Seriously this is how I feel about the common FPS games right now  COD - Know the basics of an FPS game  Battlefield - Know the basics of teamwork and squads  Arma 3 - Learn the advance stuff like compass bearings, map marking and the advance levels of the FPS element, as well as learning how to command a full military force.
2989	1	a	The Arma physics are hilarious.
2991	1	a	Strongly recommanded game. Especially when you do roleplay everyone seems serious about it and it makes it more fun. And i love that you are allowed to do everything you want like riding huge aircraft and stuffs..!
2993	1	a	the campaign was 'ok' there wasnt much to it it was very short and not that thrilling but i enjoyed it, multiplayer is pretty sweet admins on everyserver 24/7 keeps the t'kers away, combat mode is amazing compared to arma II new stances and deployment. i give it a 9.5/10
2995	1	a	Very nice game
2997	1	a	This game is what PC gaming is all about! Arma 3 Da Beast!
2999	1	a	It is a great game for people who like to play games that challenge them not just mentally but phsically becuase it is really addicting to people who like realistic combat and fight where there is bullet drop and hardcore gaming.
3001	1	a	Extremely realistic and fun milsim mmo. Reccomend for anyone who likes, well, games!
3003	1	a	Helicopter DLC overpriced
3005	1	a	great game
3007	1	a	fun game. 10/10 would reccomend again
3009	1	a	I have played this countless of times already, its a fantastic military simulator shooter and i advise you to get it now. I hate to say this but it also has a DayZ mod on it as well now so if you dont wanna spend more money than you have and still want to kill zombies, here you go.  Arma3 is the 3rd in its line of duty, its range of weapons, customization, gameplay and combat are incredible and i highly recommend this. bring a microphone and teamspeak, you're going to need it!!!
3011	1	a	Imagine dayz with good frames and cars. Oh wait that is arma 3!
3013	1	a	Decent game, most addicting one I have played so far. Super fun gamemodes, definately would recommend for anyone who likes military style games, and survival type games.
3015	1	a	First thing Bohemia has done correctly. 10/10.
3017	1	a	I sh0t l0ts of Nazi! DEUSCHLAND!
3019	1	a	A aerfectly simulated warfare sandbox which you can discover on foot, in vehicles, in the air and under sea. Whatever is your thing - cooperative teamplay, PVP madness or simply doing missions on your own. ARMA 3 offers you all this and thanks to a superb modding community and constant iterations by the developer, you will never run out of things to do or try out. Forget about CoD, forget about Battlefield, this is not a shooter, this is war.
3021	1	a	This game is the best i recommed anybody who likes military first person/thired person combat
3023	1	a	Great game you cant go wrong with this if you love millsims, and team play,
3025	1	a	I do love Arma, but Arma 3 sets a different standard. The graphics are great! But you need a really nice pc to run it on high over 60 FPS. The gunfights are a bit iffy because of glitchy player modles and bullet penetration.
3027	1	a	This game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks nuts
3029	1	a	I was playing takistan life everyone screamed allah akbar then i saw a car crash and blow up into spawn 10/10 Ign
3031	1	a	I find myself at a loss for words when I attempt to describe the feelings and emotions I encounter when I reminisce of my early days of playing Arma 3. First, before I pass my worthy judgement, Iâ€™d like to preface this review with the fact that I was totally new to the FPS and shooter genre upon purchasing Arma 3. I have never played CS:GO in my life. In fact, Iâ€™ve played very few FPS in my life. I dove into Arma totally unaware of the steep learning curve. Most of all, I purchased the game without realizing that this title would affect my perspective on PC gaming as a whole.  Arma 3 is a beautiful game. It encompasses the rush of a multiplayer FPS, the adventure of a creative sandbox, the strategy of a hardcore simulation, and a deep love for teamwork in one graphically magnificent open-world masterpiece. Iâ€™m not going to mention multiplayer teamwork in this review for the sake of the reader, as itâ€™s something you have to experience yourself, and something I could talk about all day.  While Arma 3 is an amazing game, I discourage those who are faint of specs to steer clear of this-- at times-- just as taxing on your rig as on your wits.  I can go on and on about Arma 3, and still have something new to share. Like the classic Skyrim, you find something new in Arma 3 every day. If you want a game where victory and achievement is spoonfed to you, I discourage you from purchasing this costly concoction.   But if you prefer a difficult, cinematic, challenging, realistic, heart pounding, PTSD instilling war simulator? Welcome home. This is War. This is Arma 3.
3033	1	a	After playing this game for 600 hours in different types possible (e.g.- Altis Life, Wasteland, Epoch and also Milsim with some cool people). If it would be possible to go back and not buy this game, I would not go back. Yes its addictive. Yes its fun if your playing with the right people.  I really recommend this game!
3035	1	a	Definitely worth the cash. It may have its problems, but the pros heavily outweight the cons. I love the realistic gameplay, and I have had a blast playing this game. Enjoy FPS games? Looking for realism? You can't go wrong with purchasing this game.  10/10
3037	1	a	Bye Or Die,as simple as that! 
3039	1	a	Great game for great gamers
3041	1	a	Amazing game. Try Stratis wasteland, Altis life, or domination; they're the best game types.
3043	1	a	i dont know why i like this game :|
3045	1	a	Good game, read my review on Arma 2 OA for pretty much what you need to know. Game is roughly the same in my opinion
3047	1	a	wow i bought this last week for $60 now its on sale for half that...i am done...but it's still a good game
3049	1	a	This game is a jolly load of fun.
3051	1	a	This game is probobly one of my most favourited game, the graphics are amazing, the logic is on point. The only downside to this game is that it is very poorly optimised, but if you have a high end PC you will be fine..   Buy it!
3053	1	a	Loved it!
3055	1	a	It's amazing game with great community around and huge modding potential. Go for it!
3057	1	a	The best installment of the Arma series so far. Laggy gameplay seems to have been fixed to the great extent, interesting and intensive, dramatic Single Player campaign reminds the original Operation Flashpoint times. Recommended for all tactical warfare simulation fans.
3059	1	a	Okay, so I have significantly less hours clocked into this game than most review writing players, but I think it's fair to give my first impression. I used to play Arma 2 a little, and it always sort of disappointed me. It was a great idea. A large map, lots of possibilities as to what you can do, and incredible realism and attention to detail. The issue was, the game was really, really, REALLY clunky. Didn't even feel like it was finished, in my opinion. But the idea of it was astounding. I mean, we got DayZ from Arma 2. Then along came Arma 3. It took the great idea that was Arma 2 and made it playable. Fluid animations and improved com chatter alone instantly made a difference. If you haven't played any Arma before, here's a quick rundown, from my experience. It's a game where you can walk two kilometers with no clue as to what your objective is, finally reach your supposed destination, get in a small firefight, and die in the first few seconds. Bullet to the head. Boom, down. No red stuff on your screen, no suppression effects, you're just down before you can even soil your pants. And it's actually incredibly fun. Name another game where travelling itself is enjoyable enough that the firefights are secondary? Maybe you can. I can't. As an example: I'd bought the game a few hours prior and I decided to play off a mod called Hetman: War Stories (Get it if you buy this game, btw). So I boot it up, set the time to midnight, and anxiously await as it loads a random scenario for me. It starts with a panning shot over the wonderfully large island of Altis. It's all lit up in green, like I'm watching from some sort of neato-night-vision-helicopter-thing. Then it types out a small scenario, something about a village and enemy forces and whatever, and I watch in awe as plummet towards the surface and into the eyes of a soldier on the ground. Everything's dark. I switch on my nifty little goggles and everything's lit up: the night sky, the trees around me, the rolling hills in the distance. I see some markers indicating my squad members, and my leader commands me to regroup. I'd love to admire the scenery, but instead I take off down the hill, gawking as I go, and regroup with my AI comrades and head off in the direction the squad leader points. For about thirty minutes or so, we don't see any foot soldiers. Occasionally, a helicopter will whiz overhead, and my buddies would eat the dirt to try and hide from it, so I'd dive down on my belly and hope I don't get shot, squatting in the bamboo-looking reeds and keeping my eyes to the sky. This went on for a while, and the pure tension in conjunction with the scenery immersed me completely. Then we finally get to a village. My trigger finger's getting itchy, and I go sneaking up the side of the hill all gung-ho like while the others are firing up from below. I find a perch in a building's second story and take out a few guys while the others find their way up the hill after me. Then we get in a firefight, with enemies literally on all sides. Everyone's calling out where enemies are, but even with the goggles it's still kinda dark and I can't see, and sure enough I get wounded, clipped in the leg or something. I go down, try to heal myself, and as I do so I see the guy looking down at me, his gun raised. This isn't like a normal video game, where I know my character's going to die so I panic or begrudgingly accept my fate. My stomach dropped. Seriously, like I'd swallowed a brick, and I tried to wriggle away but he managed to land one more lucky shot and end it. Everyone in m squad died except for one, who I switched to and ran to the hills until I could find another group, constantly hearing bullets crack around me the whole way. Okay, that story was long. But the point is, I didn't even last more than, what, 5 minutes in a firefight? And this instantly became one of the best experiences I've ever had in a video game, from the moment I dropped in to the moment my main character, a character with MY NAME, got shot down in a little Mediterranean town in the hills of God-knows-where. Just buy it. The price is high, yes, but if you're going to spend $60 on any game, let it be this one. On a less sentimental note, the modding community's fantastic, and you'll never run out of things to do. Graphics are great as well, and gameplay flows nice with enough functions to feel like you have real control over your character, your squad, your vehicles, everything. Oh, and if you buy it, try to get friends to buy it as well. I know I personally can't lead a squad to save my life yet (honestly, they all die under my command) so having someone to give you pointers and play squad leader in co-op missions would be ideal for sure.  10/10 purely because I can't go any higher.
3061	1	a	One of the best Shooters i played. Seems like never ending fun and ofcourse the endless mod stream! 10/10
3063	1	a	Game is playable on my 3 year old laptop.  10/10.
3065	1	a	amazing i love the game!
3067	1	a	One of the best games I have played in a long time. In the past week I have played this game ATLEAST 10 hours a day. It is hard to get used to if you are coming from a different FPS but once you get about 15 hours in the game you should be ok. The game gets even better when you have friends to play it with. this is one of the few games that I think is worth the $60 (even though I bought it for $40 with all the DLC).
3069	1	a	1000+ Hours and i'm still playing Altis Life/ King of the Hill mods.  Do you like roleplay? Buy it.  Do you like TDM? Buy it.  Do you like tactical games? Buy it.  Well Buy it.
3071	1	a	Love the game!!
3073	1	a	Best Game EVER!!!  So many posibilitys (dont know how to write it) with moddet servers and the Editior. Only thing is that the campaign is bugged as hell and desyncs suck...
3075	1	a	Not the easiest game to play but overall it looks great &amp; runs good &amp; isnt too bad of a game really
3077	1	a	Best game ever. (really is if its your style)  would rate game again for community badge
3079	1	a	By far, the best single and multiplayer experiance ever.
3081	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played. The realism is outstanding.
3083	1	a	Overall a well rounded, well put together game with a vast community. Whether its role-play, Co-op, PvP, or PVE the community has made and played them all. The game is constantly evolving and constantlly being tweaked and fixed. The progression on the game from alpha to the latest version is by far some of the best work and dedication I have ever seen out of any dev teams, even that of some triple-A titles. If you're looking for a serious gamestyle there are many different realizm groups around to show you the ropes. If your more of a relaxed weekend warrior, the winners of the Make Arma Not War competion for multiplayer missions, Kink Of The Hill has what your blood thirsty hands are looking for. From survival to out right blowing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up this is what your looking for!
3085	1	a	Altis and Stratis life are the best part about this game in my opinion. Also the editor, spawning in jets or helis and flying them around. In Altis life, my helicopter got stolen after I tried to say 'Hello!' to some guy in a ghillie. He asked for me keys so I just gave up there...
3087	1	a	It is a ultra realistic military shooter. It is very fun to play, especially with friends. It does require a very good pc, and some movements are a bit clunky. I rate an overall 7/10.
3089	1	a	I got the Game for full price, and the Game goes on sale the next day, but i would buy the Game all over again.  Fun game
3091	1	a	+ big variety of mods + new vehicle physics are great + butterfly shadows + massive world to explore with potential for long range engagements + detailed visual presentation + a lot of fun (mods: altis life, a3L, koth, exile, breaking point, wasteland...) + solo/coop missions in workshop (Doomsday,...)  - controls feel clunky - steep learning curve - technical issues - CPU heavy game (low FPS)  Ps: The Fps depends also on the server you are playing on in Multiplayer.
3093	1	a	I've played over 900+ hours of Arma 3. Most of these hours is enjoyment of Altis Life/Arma 3 Life/Takistan Life/ect. I've also played alot of Multiplayer Military simulators too. The Arma 3 community as a whole is fun and so are the custom gamemodes. If you enjoy multiplayer FPS realism then this is the game for you.  Some issues I have with the game is basically the singeplayer as a whole. Towards the start of the campaign there are IED's planted around the map which are not visible. This part of the mission you're on your own which is already I challenge. Another Issue is that the fire can be an insta kill and is extremely glitchy near burning vehicles.  Overall I really love this game and the issues aren't too big of a deal. So worth the money.
3095	1	a	nice games   with high graphique  best thing playing oline with firend  online server best thing for me altise life  or dayz mod ...
3097	1	a	waiting new update :)
3099	1	a	its nice....
3101	1	a	Where can I start with Arma 3... My friends and I spend countless hours on this game. After hours of screaming at my friends while hearing bullets snap above my head to give me suppresion fire while i move towards the treeline to get cover i hear my friends yelling over the chattery radio saying our friend was down. Arma 3 is truly the only experince you will get with your friends screaming at you saying a guy entered your compound and is pushing your building to engage. I must say that for every hour i spent on this game was worth the money spent. Some what salty community. But other than that you should be just fine with making friends upon mods like exile or Epoch. As a advanced Heli Pilot for my squad i dropped 50$ on a joy stick and love it to death this game has so many feature to put you at a higher advantage than other's but when it boils down to your PvP its all skill from there the zeroing is pretty realistic and has the feel of a sniper sitting out at 1,200 meters from his targets and watch them drop as you cover your squad as they breach the building. I introduced the game to a couple of my friends they gave it a try and now I play it with them every day. Engaging situations with your team is fun as well, As you must have great communication and reation time to complete your task. for the price goes 60$USD is for sure worth it but i'd pick it up on sale just so you can get the DLC as well. for PC specs the game doesn't take much to run Don't need a beast build to play this game to look nice. PvP and atmospheric GamePlay is quite â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome overall- Looking for new members more than glad to help any one out that needs it or just looking to play!!! ARMA 3 is sick
3103	1	a	Great game!
3105	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played.
3107	1	a	Give it about a 8.5/10 all the servers are good especially Altis Life, the campaign is good, a bit hard though. Alot of the servers has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s running them, but what game will you go to that doesn't. Although, great game.
3109	1	a	Really nice game. Never thought a game could be such a nice simulation in anything :D
3111	1	a	A very good military tactical simulator with a highly changing dynamic enviroment :D Thanks Bohemia soo much for making such a great game!
3113	1	a	Goodbye life! Takes time to learn but is very addictive! 10/10
3115	1	a	Really good game, you just have to get use to some mechanics. Overall, i give the game a 8/10.
3117	1	a	Great game. Best if played online with proper teammates. Very realistic, so it needs some time to get readjusted from COD and similar other games.
3119	1	a	Probably one of the best milsim game ever. The mod community makes it even better. I recommed this to anyone who thinks call of duty is a game for kids and wants a real challenge.
3121	1	a	A lot of mods and a lot of fun.
3123	1	a	The best god damn military simulator out there. There is nothing like it.
3125	1	a	Great game with amazing mods allot of playability
3127	1	a	This game is the OFFICIAL life sucker , there is a lifetime of content thousands of mods and custom servers. A must buy.
3129	1	a	I think its an amazing Game and if you dont have it, get it. only one problem for me though, this game seems, well, as expensive as it was when it was released, its been out for 2 years, ithink it could atleast be dropped by couple dollars anyway thats just wut i think but srsly.... get dis game....
3131	1	a	A 125mm tank shell's explosive work can be fixed by a bandage 10/10 - IGN I wasn't paid for those ratings
3133	1	a	Want to get efficiently killed by a lot by AI ? Then this is YOUR GAME !
3135	1	a	Great game plus mods
3137	1	a	Great fun game! make sure to chech out breaking point mod. Its good for a laugh or 2
3139	1	a	Best adventure and multiplayer game,,, awesome High gaphics
3141	1	a	Epic game only just started playing but feel like it will just get better
3143	1	a	Now let me say this once, if you have any AMD processor please stay away, any Rp server, King Of The Hill, or wasteland server, you will get 15-30 FPS no higher, BUT. Anyways besides the optimization, this game is probably the most detailed military simmulators I have played. There is so much content everywhere and so much to do and explore. To Roleplay servers, to headshoting someone 1k with a LRR, there is just so much to offer, for 60 bucks its like your buying 10 different games, with the possibilty to MOD. Games like Breaking Point,exile, all availible with one game, this game is truly amazing. Every pro player would most likely have 1.5k hours on this game because its amazing. Its easy to get lost in the community because there is so many people apart of it. I have 1700 Hours and every hour was well spent with friends and the community. It takes some time to get used to but it is truly an amazing experience, this game defines the reason I still play PC games today! So if you have a Intel processor, i5 or above, even some i3's get this game and play the living hell out of it. Find some friends, because it becomes amazing expereince.
3145	1	a	only game i will spend 66 hours a week on 
3147	1	a	Very good game, plenty of addons available online to make the singleplayer experience much more enjoyable. A few improvents needed, such as a realistic physics model (you can sprint up hills that would be difficult to walk up in real life) and realistic damage modules (you die instantly from one or two low calibre rounds to the chest when wearing heavy body armour, yet a high calibre sniper round takes three shots to kill an NPC with little body armour). Also needed is improvement to the AI (the AI can engage you with pinpoint accuracy when shooting from 800 metres away with assault rifles - they obviously don't have to worry about the shaky aim that the player has, also they can detect you from over 1km away when it's dark when you, the player, can't even see them with NV or can barely see them with FLIR)   I love this game, and a few minor improvements will make me love it even more!
3149	1	a	It's a great game.
3151	1	a	Welp, I've clocked over 1k hours on this game, lots to do.
3153	1	a	Terrific graphics for the people who have the system requirements, ((underneath the game-page)) - incredible military multiplayer experience that offers the player a variety of options to explore their time in Arma 3.
3155	1	a	While its at times clunky controls take a short while to get used to, there is loads of fun to be had in this game.  The multiplayer is great fun and the simulation aspect of it is attractive. While it can be rather taxing on your computer, the experience is not really found anywhere else.  Regardless if you are a hardcore milsim addict, or want to goof around with tanks, there is something for most people in this game.
3157	1	a	-begins to play Wasteland with a friend -spawns in a town -we get gear and a vehicle -we start driving towards a populated area -night time strikes -we see movement near a gunstore -we get out the car and start running towards the store -can't see crap but yolo -realize they have a tank -we start getting bombed -we run back -we hide near a wall -tank starts roaming around the wall trying to find us -tank comes inches away from our faces -tank starts to shoot randomly -we scared -we survive -another guy ventures around the wall -a bullet goes through my ***hole -my buddy looks behind and kills him -tank is still shooting randomly  10/10 wtf was that tank doing
3159	1	a	Got on a chopper  Jumped from a chopper Got shot shot before i hit the floor  10/10 Would chopper again
3161	1	a	Though unlike Arma II and Arma II OA, Arma III was less involved in a realistic soldier game and more of the FPS Call of Duty style. Although new technology has been added, it has very few new things. Notice in Arma OA the large amount of vehicles and weapons? The game makers did not get lazy, but really could have added more. The game is really stable and does not have unexpected crashes, or none that I have had.  Arma III gameplay is enough to make me want to take meth however. I understand most missions are player created but really they are all the same 'kill all the Muslims' I understand thats the art of war but most missions are the same. I recommend playing Zues because its more developing now.  Overall I recommend Arma III, but just barely. I am not that picky about my games but I felt it needed to be critical with the Arma serious as they do build up a lot of hipe before a game release. I would rank the the game 6/10 , just because of the lack of realism and lack of a dynamic gameplay. In short imagine 20 9/11s, thats arma 3
3163	1	a	this game is good
3165	1	a	awesom , the most realistic game I ever seen
3167	1	a	This game is a greate game if you are a fan of tacticalality. I would say it is one of the most tactical games out in the stean market. The worlds are massive and the gameplay is fun. I definately recommend this game.
3169	1	a	10/10
3171	1	a	good graphics . the control is harder but its a good game
3173	1	a	Wow, what a game. I started playing this having no idea what to do, now I get paid $200 to make fully functioning gearscripts. It's amazing! If you would like to learn more about how I got sexually assaulted, please check out this game on steam!
3175	1	a	One of the better FPS games on the market.A must have game.Better than Call of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and Battlefield. 10/10
3177	1	a	If you are looking for a tictical military simulation get arma 3
3179	1	a	Will be hard to get to grips with at the start, but dont let that affect you.. once you get to grips with everything, this game becomes the BOMB! I used to regret buying this game but now im addicted.   You should try out King of the Hill (SC) game mode, its really fun!   or  RPG mode ALTIS life, its a little strange at first, especially if you've never played Role Play games before. Everyone is really serious and its a bit much for newcomers but nevertheless its definitely something new!   find what you like! and ill tell you that your money is definitely not going to waste :):)  good luck!
3181	1	a	it took a dump in my mouth
3183	1	a	hard to say need more time with the game to say if its good or bad
3185	1	a	If you like realistic battlefield and have good specs, you definitaly should play this game!
3187	1	a	Love this game thanks to this and arma 2 got me in to pc gaming 10/10
3189	1	a	love this game
3191	1	a	It's got it's fair amount of bugs but it's a great game.  Best played with a group.
3193	1	a	Think if Skyrim and Battlefield had a baby and then it started doing meth.
3195	1	a	Great game, wonderful developers, plenty of mod support, would recommend, best Military Simulation I've ever played.
3197	1	a	great game though i wish it felt more like arma 2 other than that its amazing may struggle on some setups
3199	1	a	Great game love playing it.
3201	1	a	Best game ever can shoot coons in the dome with a tank or even a little pea shooter rate 9/11 outa good.
3203	1	a	Buy it. Now.
3205	1	a	Best game ever you can run ultra and get over 60 fps if you have a good enough pc. i have a  8gb ram GeForce 760 winows 10 and amd quad core 4.00 ghz and i can run at a minimum of 100fps on very high
3207	1	a	Arma 3 is a unique military simulation game with many other elements of gameplay. The variety of gamemodes add so much content for you to enjoy! I have over +1000 hours on this game and have seen every corner of what this game has to offer. You can complete the awesome storyline, play on a variety of servers, or create your own world using the editor. I've had a great time playing this game with friends and you probably will too!  Multiplayer: 9/10 Singleplayer: 9/10
3209	1	a	10/10 would play again. MLG many mods.
3211	1	a	Great game. Much wow. Many excite. 
3213	1	a	This game contains best parts of every shooter and RTS I played. You can succeed without having very good reaction or something else like that, and in fact it's usually better to be tactical and come up with a plan other than 'Run and gun the enemy down.' Also, as of Pre-Apex the DLCs aren't really neccesary to enjoy the game.
3215	1	a	LOVE ITTTTT
3217	1	a	Brilliant game. plenty of:    servers,     scenarios,    workshop items     content   the editor is powerfull but the heli dlc is very overpriced and the free zeus dlc is very good. needs a little optimisation and bugfixing but other than that, one of my favorite games.
3219	1	a	Realistic weapon sounds Good graphics (for today) You feel like a real soldier in the war - in this game . Good Game.
3221	1	a	Best shooter on the market
3223	1	a	9/10
3225	1	a	Another game with alot of opportunity and all that, great mods coming out for it aswell definitely would recommend it's good for the price.
3227	1	a	F**King Fantastic
3229	1	a	Only game where the lag kills you 10/10.
3231	1	a	It's very good game for me, it's supporting mods and more stuff, there is so much new people to meet, but DLC's... DLC's are good but that can't be like that you need to buy everything to get access to it So I'll give that game solid 9.5/10
3233	1	a	I like every thing about arma 3, all the mods you can download and everything you can add to your map and its just an all round beautiful game
3235	1	a	please rudse the price of arma 3 to Â£24 again so i can buy it for all my mates arma 3 is so fun to play when you have got some friends on the game to its just greate i think everyone should buy it when it goes down price of coruse :D
3237	1	a	its a good fun game
3239	1	a	This game is really fun, and has so much mods you can play. I really reccommend this game. But there is one down part to it... IT'S ADDICTING!
3241	1	a	This is the most amazing military simulator out there. Call of Duty players say goodbye to your MLG and try to master ARMA III and you'll find it impossible. Anyways this game has AMAZING graphics and offers SO MANY FREAKING KEY BINDING!So do I recommend this game/simulator HELL YEAH!!!
3243	1	a	great game
3245	1	a	Don't really like the sound, but other than that, like they say, men play Arma. Each mission is different and you never know whats going to happen, but as you train, everything becomes muscle memory and you respond approprately. There's always space for improvement. Love this simulator.
3247	1	a	This game is great but I never want to play it because it runs at 12 frames on all of my friends' computers (most of them are better than mine)
3249	1	a	this game was fun and stuff. it also smelled good.
3251	1	a	Great game, hours of fun.   limitless play time with innumerous mods
3253	1	a	This is a fun game.
3255	1	a	Pretty Good, Too many 1 years olds doe   5year old/10
3257	1	a	booty
3259	1	a	This is one of my favorite games that I own. I love the varied game modes and available mods that add to the game. The graphics can be a bit demanding but definitely pretty.
3261	1	a	Pff where should I start. Let's start out with the fact that I'm only three hours away from having 600 hours in this game. Umm.. yeah, I can really recommend this game to everyone who is looking for a realistic (no, let's not say realistic, instead simulating reamlisme) This game is trying really hard to simulate realisme, which to be fair it does pretty decent aswell.. Of course you can never really make a game that is totally realistic, but this does the job for me at least. I'd say the campaign is decent, way better than the games before it though. I play mainly altis life, where I meet lots of friends and people who stole my kidney. There is not that many TDM servers though, mostly german ones. But plenty of CooP servers (I recommend '=7Cav=' Coop server) Umm yeah, the inventory-UI is wastly improved and is a lot more easy to use. Also there is a ton of new 'combat stances' which can come in handy if the fence you are hiding behind is to low to prone or too tall to crouch behind. The AI... is um really like it's always been stupid and careless but once they spot you from like over 1000m they are able to hit you like it was nothing, that can be a bit a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ sometimes, but hey.. Don't get this game for singleplayer experience go buy this game, go to multiplayer and search for some 'Altis life' 'Wasteland' servers. Hey did you know 'Altis' is an actually Greek island called 'Limnos/Lemnos'
3263	1	a	Negative reviews: DIS GAME ISNT OPTIMIZED  *Proceeds to run game on a Mac.*  Oh yeah, this game is   Horribly   Optimized.
3265	1	a	Was a sniper in a wasteland convoy with a 50. Cal   Saw a chopper get shot down and fall into a death spin then crash in my face like in the movies  Has what is possibly the most complex key mapping in any game I've played  It's aight
3267	1	a	Its a fantastic game but be warned unless your into heavy roleplay their isent to much here besides the lackluster campaign and standard shooter game modes but if you have a nice rig and want to roleplay i suggest joining a milsim unit or a life community.
3269	1	a	If I had to chose only one game to play and get rid of the rest. I'd pick Arma 3.
3271	1	a	10.0  Pros: -An insane amount of high quality, super fun, multiplayer mods -Simulation style in all aspects -Pretty graphics -Super customizable from head to toe -Once you grasp it, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome -Breaking Point (mod) -Altis Life RPG (mod)  Cons: -LOTS of controls to work with -Not your average shooter; steep learning curve
3273	1	a	Everything you could ever want and more! even better with mods :D
3275	1	a	This game is great. Lots of hours wasted. +Graphics are stunning +Not too many bugs, and not really any game breaking bugs +Mods fully supported, and plenty of them out there to find a server to fit you +Realistic not one fo those CoD wannabe's - Addicting - Long distances on foot, take forever - Might need to upgrade PC to handle the high graphics
3277	1	a	If you're into military simulation and/or huge moddability (and therefore hundreds of gamemodes as Altis Life, Breaking Point, etc.) this is the game for you.  I love the crap out of this game but I give it a 8/10 because there's still a LOT of room for optimization.
3279	1	a	Wow , why dayz couldn't be like this , better performance means more fun , but like your videocard doesn't change anything for dayz , cause i had gt 430 it was 30 fps everything on low even resolution , bought gtx 750 ti and nothing cahnges wtf. i don't even know if this is dayz or arma 3 review but wasteland is fun and battle royal :) 9/10
3281	1	a	I highly recommend Arma 3 really great production for pc games I played this game 160 hours , and I still want to play it
3283	1	a	Very in Depth and all inclusive.
3285	1	a	9/10  Arma 3 is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive, taken to the next level.
3287	1	a	GET IT
3289	1	a	Very fun to play with friends!
3291	1	a	Best Military game i have ever laid eyes on. I can never express my graditude and thanks to the develpoers for this amazing game. I truley do love this game. The first day i bought it i had 32 hours of gametime. You have to be orginized, this isnt black ops. Its the most realistic game i have ever played and wanna play! Nothing comes close to this game.! keep up the great work! #ARMA4EVER!!!!
3293	1	a	The definition of a military themed sandbox game. Part of a franchise that has been going strong since 2001, I have no doubt this newest installment will provide me and many others with countless hours of pure unadulterated fun!
3295	1	a	The problem with this game is that it's not in your library yet
3297	1	a	great game lots of fun.
3299	1	a	What more to say? Coming back to this from a few years away and it's great to see how its developed. Being a fan from Arma, Arma 2 and even VBS 2, you can't go wrong with checking this out. But there are conditions: you have to love the milsim side of life, you can do ANYTHING. You have to persevere also. You will die. Again and again... This game will suck you in. Big time....
3301	1	a	There is one thing by which i know a game is good. That is if i've spent 886 hours on it and still haven't beaten the campaign
3303	1	a	WARNING : DO NOT buy this game, if you do, you'll never see the sunlight again !
3305	1	a	good realistic game
3307	1	a	A great game, It's realistic and expansive, with a wide range of thins to play, from Altis life to MilSim to Exile, Arma 3 has a gamemode for any Fps fan.  Side note- I play Arma 3 on a laptop so you don't need a beastly PC to run it.
3309	1	a	Arma 3 hay s the gun play of call of duty and the wide vehicle selection like battlefield.
3311	1	a	The Arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. Arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description 'Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox...'. I would love to have Arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspect's of the game. But becides that it is amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone who like military game's. If ur a COD or Battlefeild (Which I am but not as much as Arma 3) fan watch out because Arma 3 is the next big thing.   &gt; Profile Name &lt;,   Game On!
3313	1	a	After playing this game for so many hours, i never cease to entertain myself! Whether it's fighting Hostile forces for control in King of the hill, Executing your enemies in wasteland or Fighting for survival in ARMA 3's very own version of DayZ.  This game is great, recently DayZ was ported from ARMA 2 into ARMA 3, and must i say its exquisite it's a perfect port and Overpoch is a ton of fun.  I was hooked on Altis life for a very long time, the roleplay in that gametype is amazing, if your unsure of what Altis life is, check it out on youtube there are plenty of vids showcasing it ;)  Wasteland is where team tactics can really come out, You choose to join one of three teams which include the : Blufor (NATO), OpFor (CSAT) or the Independent (AAF).   In conclusion this game is great! Even if you don't have any friends to play it with you'll make friends incredibly easy. Since Overpoch has been ported it's added even more to the awesome!  Buy this, Enjoy it.  Jadex Out
3315	1	a	2D 8bit platformer, good game. 10/10
3317	1	a	Oh, Arma. You treat me like dirt, yet I still want to be in you. Walking the thin line between love and hate.
3319	1	a	Great game, good graphics.
3321	1	a	Fantastic but real, hardcore but awesome!
3323	1	a	EA and DICE, you should be ashamed of yourselves, letting another game take Battlefields spot. This is the next big thing in FPS teamwork and sandbox gaming.   Too bad guys, you spent too much time pandering to hardware that is more concerned with TV and BlueRay than games, making your games smaller so they run on outdated hardware with poor control systems and pooping on the people who bought you your Ferraris. Bohemia Interactive has taken the reins and taken the lead. You should have seen this coming with Arma2, especialy after DayZ. Bohemia Interactive already has my money and where is BF4... Not in my games library.   Arma3 is the AAA title you should buy. Don't waste your money on Battlefield X or Call of Duty X, this is what you want right here. Once you buy this you will dig in and not look up at all the crap that is being pooped out, packaged and sold at a premium price. Arma3 is priced at $59.99 or $64.99 for the Digital Deluxe Edition (or if you want my recomendation, go straight to the Bohemia Interactive website and support them directly by buying the Supporter Edition) you can't go wrong. Drop some cash on this and you wont need or want to spend your money on anything FPS until the next Arma3 content release.   See you on the islands.   Edited for price changes as it was written during Beta.
3325	1	a	Great community and really fun playing on servers playing in groups with other people. plenty of game modes avaiable, however the DLC is very pricey and should not be that much.
3327	1	a	Get the game, huge replay value multiple modes, and of course workshop items. It's basically infinitley replayable. The sandbox is really good, some mulitplaye servers are good. And some parts of the standard campagin are really intresting. But don't get it if you hate crashing alot, or unecissary loading screens. Or just the game turning your wifi into a potato in a toaster.
3329	1	a	Very Nice Map and Good new vehicle When milkman say its good its Awsome
3331	1	a	Massive improvement from Arma 2, but unfortunately the DLC's are very very pricey and in my opinion not really worth the money as the base game itself only costs very little more than the APEX dlc.   
3333	1	a	PTSD simulator 2016 I cannot hear buzzing sounds anymore without thinking of an A-164 firing a gatling gun at my unit.
3335	1	a	Highly recommend!
3337	1	a	Probably one of my favorite shooters so far. The modded servers like Altis life, Battle Royale and Wasteland
3339	1	a	This game requires skill, focus, and percision. This is what makes a game beautiful. A must buy!
3341	1	a	Awesome game, hours of fun and never the same mission twice. 10/10
3343	1	a	Large improvement over arma 2, still needs work tho in my humble opinion. And optimisation! rolling it on a mid range system produces less than playable results exactly when you need it to run smoothly the most: multiplayer firefights. There's something inherently wrong with the way you program your game engines guys. Probably make a better game engine, one that handles all the stuff it ha to do in a smart way, so you don't need a top of the line PC to play on medium quality! All in all, it's worth buying. Not going to improve much in the areas it suffers, because they are tied in with the game engine, but as technomogy catches up, it will be fun to play the mods people are making for this, just like dayz was... without the cheaters hehe. Props to Rocket for that one, but dayz standalone is still a total fail...
3345	1	a	Online multiplayer:   Me: 'under fire' Friend: 'Where from!?' Me:'I dont know....Ummm (Checking compass bearing)....Oh doesnt matter im dead' Friend: 'oh ok'  Awesome game with huge diversity, play as a team for best experience, only probelm with this game is that the online servers can sometimes have really terrible fps with your pc, even if you have a good rig.
3347	1	a	This game is the reason why people call me a no life gamer
3349	1	a	Great and a fun game.
3351	1	a	Amazing overall its great for really imersing yourself in the experience of a real life army sim.
3353	1	a	10/10
3355	1	a	10% lag 20% desync 15% rage 5% overpriced 50% game crashes 100% reason to get a better pc
3357	1	a	Full review  here  
3359	1	a	I have PTSD from this game.
3361	1	a	played 1 hour, got banned  gg would get banned again 10/10
3363	1	a	Arma 3 is truly a great game, when it comes to arma, there is no boredom. Just when you think theres nothing else to do, check the workshop, make your own mission, join a new gamemode... Theres always more!
3365	1	a	This game rocks!!!
3367	1	a	You guys should definitely try this game out if you into doing everything in war games! I mean come on?! Dive to the beach and jump out of water kill an all enemy squad and dive back to your ship in MP!!! and you dont even need mods COME ON!  Be a sniper for 1500 meters shoot and hit.....  Or you can use mods and its going to be the best game ever!   BUY IT NOW AND STOP BEING IN THE SUN FOR A LIFE TIME :D
3369	1	a	Great :)
3371	1	a	If you are into mil sims you should definitely check this out!
3373	1	a	Arma III is a combat simulator. It creates an envioroment where you can perform and learn the basics of the movement of a military soldier. The campaign is really good, there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where I find it hard at some cases. But overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like.  I also love multiplayer on Arma III. People can transform CO-OP gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer, like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning, tatical, commands, things like that. It makes the game look real. Arma III was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time. There are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur....  The game is quite expensive I know, its 35.99 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this. If you want to spend more on it you can buy Digital Deluxe Upgrade for 8.99. I recommend buying the Deluxe Edition for 39.99, make sure you like what you are buying of the Deluxe Edition. When you buy this game I hope you have alot of fun. Thanks!   
3375	1	a	Played Tutorial- Realized game was very realistic  Played Beginning of Campaign- Had lots of fun  Joined A Co-Op Server 'Terrorist Hunt'- Got team-Killed two times at spawn.  10/10 Experience Very Realistic
3377	1	a	a very nice game
3379	1	a	1.buy game 2.refund 3.buy Overpass souvenir package 4.Unbox AWP pink ddpat souvenir 5.buy game again 6.Profit
3381	1	a	Ths game is alot of fun, BEST game I played so far! I was able to try it free this past weekend and wanted to buy it but the Price went up before I could and it just dd not fit into my budget.   ((((((((((( But I have to give this one 5 Stars! )))))))))))  If you are going to buy a game on STEAM, Make it ARMA 3 !!!
3383	1	a	Arma is the sh!t! Hands down! Boo hoo if you can't run it... Go upgrade and STFU!
3385	1	a	Love the game, Super fun, also love Role-Playing  
3387	1	a	Eh, its ok.
3389	1	a	arma 3 is very fun
3391	1	a	One&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;best&nbsp;games&nbsp;I&nbsp;ever&nbsp;played. A&nbsp;hardcore&nbsp;milsim. The&nbsp;opposite&nbsp;of&nbsp;CoD. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;now&nbsp;addicted&nbsp;to&nbsp;flight&nbsp;C:
3393	1	a	army shoot man game  vary good game  i recommend buy
3395	1	a	Amazing game, can be very realistic but also fun. DLCs are over-priced though so I would only buy them on a sale. The price of the game on the other hand is reasonable and is definetley worth the Â£30 as there is so much you can do with it. I've had 709 hours on this game and I am still not bored, which is nothing compared to some players with crazy hours. The workshop offers absolutely loads of mods that you can try so if you do get bored of the vanilla then you can always switch it up. Community has been fantastic so far and I've had a lot of fun on Vanilla servers with people that are not realism lovers so you don't have to get mods to enjoy the game and its community. I have not enjoyed some of the AI aimbot like powers though, AI really bugs me as I am constantly finding myself getting rekt by AI at stupid ranges so this can make the game less fun but is still great.
3397	1	a	If you're into hyper-realistic shooters, this is as good as you're going to get.
3399	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME FOR LIFE!
3401	1	a	sick asf
3403	1	a	Gripes mainly on the fact that i still can't punch people or have a combat knife
3405	1	a	'We need Evac!'  'Where's that evac!?'  'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ no evac!'  Dead
3407	1	a	The game is very entertaining, and there is quite a bit of content to choose from with all of the mods available for the game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPSs, although this isn't your normal FPS and you should look into the gameplay a bit before you just jump in, as it took me quite awhile to get used to the controls.  I do find it difficult to get more than 30FPS in this game with a 980TI and an i7 3930k, but I play on a 4K resolution monitor so that plays a big part, and your results may vary, just understand that your frames may vary depending on hardware, and server as well.
3409	1	a	you need a cpu and gpu that can curl at least an 60 pound dumbell in order to run this game smoothly
3411	1	a	151 hours of Altis Life. Best 151 hours spent. 10/10 would pick apples again.
3413	1	a	Ultra-realistic...in a way.
3415	1	a	Difficulty. Complex. Un-optimezed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that sucks you in.  Buy it!
3417	1	a	I just wish I had more time to play this game... the mods are the best part tho  But the M107 with AP rounds its the duck's nutts
3419	1	a	Install Survival mod Jump on server Become one of three biggest clans in server Clan comments on youtube to raid them while online We raid them while online 25 satchel charges later Discover clan has glitch built main part of base into building so satchel charges do nothing Clan continue to glitch build and camp fresh spawn location Stop playing for a while Jump on server See clan swim across river Shoot clan member swiming across river in the face Find out its that clan Other clan members run me over in a strider and call it 'karma' 20/10
3421	1	a	there are words that have not been created that describe this game!
3423	1	a	ArmA 3 helped my life so much, it increased my salt levels by 9000% and now I have the resources to deal with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of real life. I have renamed my office at work to the Salt Room because, as a manager, I have to deal with peoples problems and issues and I felt it was only fitting.
3425	1	a	It's pretty good.
3427	1	a	Are you bored of Call Of Duty and Battlefield or CS:GO? U want to feel like real soldier? This game is for you!  Good things -Simulator -A lot of mods  -Nice community -Character costumisation kind of -Campaign, about 20 missions -Multiplayer with lots of game modes created by us, players -A lot of mods!!  Bad Things -Very good PC needed -Physics you are drunk go home -Not many Vehicles -Not many factions and weapons -New dlc costs 25 euros  8/10 in my oppinion.
3429	1	a	Although this is a supremely hard game to run, although this game is sometimes supremely boring, although this game can sometimes give you intermittent explosive disorder, it is still one of my absolute favourite games because of the intensive situations, range of excellent weapons, and intresting gameplay. The great range of vehicles and weapons gives the game a immersive feeling. The visually stunning graphics made my eyes bleed for everytime i played it. The social and friendly (ish) community is great. I without hesitation definatly recommend this game to you. I guarantee this will be great - just make sure you play it for a bit as it may seem to be boring at first.
3431	1	a	If you own a PC and don't own this game. What are you doing?
3433	1	a	'Great game'
3435	1	a	100/10 Worth erry $$$
3437	1	a	well worth the money and i have over 1300 hours of gameplay
3439	1	a	If you search for realistic/easy moded/tactical/army/multiplayer/singleplayer/1st/3rd person shooter, then I'm afraid there is nothing better than this.
3441	1	a	I've barely learned the controls.
3443	1	a	Its gr8 bnter
3445	1	a	So real, my squad and I sat out in the middle of no where telling lies about women.
3447	1	a	A good Arma player knows how to use the many features (glitches) to their advantage...
3449	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I have played this game for almost 1000 hours now and I have done so much. There are so many different gamemodes you can play from roleplaying to coop missions to military simulations. I have listed my pros and cons below:  Pros: - Amazing Graphics - Multiple Gamemodes - Active Development Team - Very little bugs - Campaign - Multiplayer - Steam Workshop  Cons: - You need a high end PC to run at max graphics - Some servers are controlled by people that ruin that gamemode - Most servers are European. - Bugs that will just kill you for no reason.  Overall I would rate this game a 8/10.
3451	1	a	Awesome game and awesome graphics and if u got a normal pc you can still play it on realtime fps! i got a pretty bad pc and i got 25-30 fps on normal graphics!!! if you like military games this is recommended!
3453	1	a	Good Game but the Engine is unmatured. This game runs on my Pc with 30-40 FPS. PC: AMD FX6300 3,5 Ghz 8Gb RAM Nvidia GTX 660 Arma needs a new Engine then is Arma perfect. I call a few Pros and Cons:  Â°Good Gameplay Â°many vehicles Â°many Weapons Â°a very big Map (over 22km) Â°the Multiplayer is amazing Â°Fun is endless in this Game ________________________ -Bad Engine(FPS Drops) -too many Bugs  9/10 Points
3455	1	a	10/10 best arma 2 clone ever!
3457	1	a	this game is just the best game that there is out there. If you feel like roleplaying you can go on altis life. wanna roleplay more go on life mod. want to kill people play king of the hill or wasteland. want to survive and kill people play dayz mod or excile mod
3459	1	a	10/10 would allah uckbar my helicopter into civis on Life Servers again.
3461	1	a	Bought it for breaking point, didnt disappoint me. The mod is better than Dayz Standalone itself    there is no dsync, no fps drops,   and you can bury people    yes, you can bury people  
3463	1	a	9/10 Would rate more if it didnÂ´t cost this little.
3465	1	a	Totally worth the 60 bucks, got it over the summer and I already have 505h logged, #nolife, extremlly fun though and the community is awesome!  You don't need the DLC's to enjoy the game, but if you really think you'll need them buy them when they are on sale.  
3467	1	a	If you really want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off some nerds, buy this and tell them it sucks and you are going to play COD on your XBOX.
3469	1	a	I've played it a couple times, not bad.
3471	1	a	Buy this game. Just buy it... You won't be disappointed!
3473	1	a	Probably one of my favorite games of all time. There is just so much do, even without mods there is hundreds of hours worth of content! 10/10 highly recommend!
3475	1	a	Great game fun to play I also really like the role playing servers on multiplayer
3477	1	a	Its a really good game :)
3479	1	a	Super steep learning curve, just learning the basic controls is difficult, and it's probably one of the only games where something simple can get you killed by the enemy. Because of this it's incredibly realistic, the online community is very helpful, and there's no twelve year olds telling you they banged your mom on this game. It's also a great game if you enjoy sandbox games, the editor is great and has it's own sort of learning curve if you want to make anything complex. Zeus is probably my favorite game mode from any video game, since you're either controlling everything on the spot or you're playing a mission that's being made for you on the spot. Despite all this the RV engine sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ so 8/10
3481	1	a	I found a gun on the ground like my second PvE game, I picked it up and I've been using it ever since. I salute the fallen soldier who bestowed upon me this gift.
3483	1	a	Fun to play but needs RHS Escalation mods and the ARMA 2 maps along with a few other mods to really become enjoyable..   Without mods the game is decent, not as good as Arma 2.  TLDR: Worse than Arma 2 without any mods.... Better than Arma 2 with mods.
3485	1	a	this game is perfect to play with friends and even better with the various mods you can install and play, can be buggy at times but is overall a great experience and super fun game! 9/10
3487	1	a	I have wasted many hours into Arma and its completely worth it Pros The fact that if you get bored of shooting you can play many mods for example arma 3 life one of the greatest possible roleplays ive seen in history  Another fact is that i never knew how much organ dealing could sell for now im a corrupt drug addict :)  Physics are fantastic but sometimes there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like all games Realism it is a simulation of war and its pretty close to war but to be honest you can never really get that close ever to actual war  Massive Variety of guns to choose from Cons Theres no Ak47 Rip One dlc is for a map thats barely a new game
3489	1	a	Drive for half an hour to get to the fighting, so you can shoot in the general direction of unseen enemies before you die.  10/10
3491	1	a	I dont even have this game why can I write a review?
3493	1	a	The most realistic game for true tacticians or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  9/11
3495	1	a	10 out of 10 would Arma III forever.
3497	1	a	It was k
3499	1	a	THE reason to buy a PC instead of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ con*ugh ugh*...
3501	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3503	1	a	its rlly rlly gud u shuld buy it m8.
3505	1	a	Oh yes.   Arma 3, well arma 3 with out mods is like boobs with no silicon.    Vanilla arma 3 68/100   Because the guns look stupid, but you get alot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to do, for example altis life, king of the hill and much more. But when you install the mods RHS and taskforce radio and some custom maps the game gets the real feeling. + Join a community then it's heaven     With mods i would say 88/100
3507	1	a	-=Recommended=-  Definetly one of the best tactical shooters out there and worth buying because of...   -beautiful (and realistic looking) graphics   -good and very tactical game- and especially gunplay  -complex and realistic (physics-) engine  -nice community  -good mod-support
3509	1	a	10 fps out of 10, would find a job and buy new PC!
3511	1	a	A very fun gamw while playing with friends! :D
3513	1	a	i love this . even more than myself :D  this game is great also it has unblieveable Graphics on the other hand it has alot of modes  u gotta play this one
3515	1	a	Arma 3 is awesome.. the end :)
3517	1	a	Played for 20 minutes, killed 9 guys I think i might become the best ever
3519	1	a	Great game! very fun to play with some friends. Mod support is awsome so the gameplay can be very diverse. 11/10
3521	1	a	Great game! Just finished the tutorial
3523	1	a	Game is fantastic  there's so much to do and alot of options to handle a situation you could roll on a tank and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the place up or you could make friends and roll in a helicopter price is too high for this game i think but thats my opinion I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME play it. love it. live it. get your grades and social life down. (learn military lingo)
3525	1	a	my pc cant run it vary well as of right now but spend 3-4k on it &amp; the $60 to buy the game and it is worth it unles u donot like good graficks and a good fps then spend $700 on a crappy pc and go kill ur eyes so that they hav 3 fps cause thats how muthc a reguler at the min requiermints pc will give u i think cause i have 1 that gives me 15 fps and iv herd that they will go lower evon if u have no ai in on the vr do not buy this game if u dontknow what ur specks are. so check ur specks befor u buy this game it was almost a waste of $ to buy this game but ther is 1 pluse if u get a pc that hase the same specks as mine u will get beter fps on arma than on bf4 but be warned if u through any smok gronads they will kill ur fps  So i hop that this was helpfol  sry for the typing errors i dont know how to sell i did not pay atention in english class to mutch stuf to lern thats why its not spelled vary well 
3527	1	a	Mass lag i mean complete frame lock up turned game from ultra to potatoe mode no fix changed back to ultra no fix look on internet for 30 mins no fix cry a little look on internet more is told to turn down audio quality turn down audio quality game fixed My graphics were not set to high. My audio settings were.  10/10 would hear game to good again.
3529	1	a	So much fun, so many scenarios endless possibilities, lots of mods, lots of gamemodes and lots of hours well spent that ill never regret. rating out of 10? 100% a 10. i love the game, i dont know what i would do without it xD
3531	1	a	I'm a Battlefield 4 player, so i'm noobs Download game=&gt;Open game=&gt; Finish training easily so i think this game is to damn easy  1st: Open campaign, meets two enemies, ONLY 2, i have killed 5 enemies in 1 round in battlefield 4 so i run and shoot them like a boss. suddenly, i fall down and 'You Died'!!!

3533	1	a	You'll definately lose your girlfriend.
3535	1	a	Experiences with helicopters:  Very first game: Get in small chopper with five guys and fly for about six minutes to meet a contact. Upon reaching him, I promptly shot him as I didn't see a nameplate.  Some time later: Get in back of dual rotor troop transport with ~6 other troops. Get near LZ, high power shot passes through the hull behind my head, whistles past me and wrecks my SL who was briefing us on the mission.  Several days later: Time to try the pilot class. What could go wrong? I task myself with evacing a small squad on the ground under heavy enemy fire. I get about a kilometer away, when enemy AA takes out my engine and some other fancy control things. With what I could control, I maneuvered around while trailing black smoke calling MAYDAY over the group chat. I hit the ground hard, somehow still intact, and grind along the terrain for at least a hundred meters, tearing my rotor off on a nearby tree and hitting a few enemy soldiers during the powerslide. I crawl out of the wreckage barely alive, and talk through the radio to reassure them that I survived. I then hear the ground team over the radio saying that their mission was now a rescue op. To them, they saw a helo closing in to land, only to crash in the most violent way possible, pretty much cutting a path to me. They made it just as I got shot up.    Bravo Squad's final stand: This happened earlier today and had my heart pounding, our ten man squad was deployed in the open completely surrounded by enemies. Within seconds of disembarking, enemy fire cut down a few of us, who we were forced to leave up on the hill. We all scrambled down in different directions to find tiny pieces of cover while we waited for our attack chopper to open fire. He did, but was promptly hit and crash landed a quarter mile away. With our remaining men, we moved down the valley toward the wreckage, finding him incapacitated next to the cockpit. On a quick head count, we found that our combat medic had been killed in the opening wave and we had no way to save him in the field. While our SL called for a medevac, I picked up the pilot and pulled him into a small house, which we quickly garrisoned. By this time, we were down to five of our original team, plus one of our own wounded and the pilot. Our requests for a medevac quickly turned into an extraction request, which was accepted by a pilot nearly 10km away.  We held for several minutes, until we started to hear the chopper getting close to our position. My SL had been shot in the face through a window, along with our marksman. The incoming pilot essentially told us that we had ten seconds after he touched down to get on board or he would have to leave. Aware of this, I picked up the heli pilot, an engineer picked up our SL, and our other autorifleman followed behind us, giving covering fire. the engineer reached the chopper. loaded our SL into the back and jumped in, giving supporting fire. I reached the chopper next, and just as I got the pilot inside, a shot hit me in the back and incapacitated me. Our rifleman turned to me, and in that moment got shot in the arm.  He just yelled at our pilot to go, the fire was too much to stay. Not even five seconds after dustoff, an enemy sniper caught him.  You could say I'm enjoying the game.
3537	1	a	One of my all time favorites. Tons of playability. Tons of mods and community content.  I would add more vehicles to the main game. More civ cars, and more common military transports like humvees. Maybe some more buildings as well.  Will keep playing until ARMA 4.
3539	1	a	Me: 'I have a very bad feeling about this place!'  Friend: 'It's okay just keep going straight.'  Me: 'Well you said you spotted an enemy helicopter.'  Friend: 'No it's fine just keep going!'  Me: 'Ok then!'  *Enemy soldier blasts us in our vehicle with an RPG*  Just Arma 3 problems! 10/10

3577	1	a	Great game
3579	1	a	This game is incredible and what makes it so good, is the variety of ways you can play it alongside the amazing levels of customization   Want to play a  Mil-Sim ? Arma 3 has your back, with Land, Sea, and Air combat options. Stay frosty. Want to play an  Open World Zombie Survival ? Arma 3 Breaking Point has you wondering who to trust, and who to kill over a can of beans. Want to play a  City/Island Life RolePlay  as a Police Officer, Drug Dealer, or various other occupations? Arma 3's gotchu  This only scratches the surface of this games vast communities, but you get the point. The game's players are dedicated and very productive when it comes to making mods, and that's because Bohemia Interactive ALLOWS FULL ACCESS for players to do so, knowing that the players know what they want, and know how to create and tailor it best, while they improve the core game's functionality. This full access has also led to many scripts and 'hax' being made, but their Anti-Cheat has evolved to counter most, if not all, in the recent years. Even if it doesn't catch one, it's incredibly likely that an Admin in your selected community will handle the problem himself.  Having dumped hundreds of hours into both ARMA 2 and ARMA 3, and taking party in many of the mods made by the community, I can confidently say that these are my favorite games and  I would absolutley recommend this game to any friend or fellow gamer.  The games go on sale very often so if you want to save a few moneybucks, you can wait for those, otherwise I encourage any and all to become part of this game and join one of the many communities within it.

3581	1	a	I can very easily say that this has took away my life
3583	1	a	watch out for the pistol bangerz in kavala

Why you here? Scroll down
3589	1	a	This is one of the best PC games I have ever played, I love how you can play so many different gamemodes. The realism servers are great and this game has just so much to offer. Looking at it as a military simulation game, It certainly simulates it better than any other military game I have EVER played. I would highly recommend this game to anyone :D
3591	1	a	Experiences in ARMA 3:  1) Our arma regiment uses a modded server, including a new map, ace (which adds some depth to the medical system and some other nifty features), TaskForceRadio (people must be close to each other or have a radio at the correct frequency to communicate) a bunch of new items, vehicles etc.  The Zeus/GM/HQ/leader of the regiment who sets up and manipulates our scenarios on the fly gives us our next mission. We're going to insert via helicopter near an enemy (All enemy is AI) base and take it over. We get our equipment together (I take medical supplies, as medic) and mount up.   We have our usual banter as we approach the landing site, our Zeus directs the AI pilots of the helo to land but the AI just keeps going, either because they think we are being shot at or because they can't figure out how to land at the designated point.   We're now passing over the point, going into enemy territory. I think our Zeus realises this and commands everyone to bail. Now we're being shot at, I start getting my parachute from the helicopter's inventory. Out of the corner of my eye, I see bullets light up the cockpit and one of the pilots slumps forward, the helicopter descends. I replace my backpack full of medical supplies with the parachute and prepare to jump... but now the helicopter is too low. If I jumped now, I'd probably fail to open my parachute soon enough and injure myself severely, so my only choice was to wait 'till the helicopter was low enough and just hope I don't get shot as I get out.   I dismount as it's about to touch the ground and bullets start smacking the helicopter from the side that I had gotten out. I quickly run around to the other side without taking any injuries. Our squad has landed in a clearing that is surrounded by forest, in a kind of Y shape, with our squad at the intersection of open area. We're all spread out along this clearing, and the enemy has surrounded us entirely. A couple of our men were already dying and more were going to follow. I hear over the radio our Zeus and another team leader call for a retreat back to the base, but with so many enemies around us, that was near impossible.   I stay behind the helicopter, trying to spot enemies from my position, but with only gunfire as my indicator, it was near impossible to know exactly where the bullets were coming from.  I remember that I've left all of my medical supplies in the helicopter, which I need since people are getting shot to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, so I go up to the door and see if I can reach the inventory inside. I can't, unfortunately, so the only way I was going to get those supplies was to hop inside the back and expose myself to gunfire. One of my squad-mates, a marksman, obviously has the same idea, he probably left his ammunition and bandages behind after grabbing a parachute. He hops in and I follow suit, I quickly close the door, grab my bag and get out. Great, now I can actually be of some use, since I can't see where the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ these guys are shooting from (I could've used the map to see them, but I feel like that's kinda cheat-y).   I take a look around, still trying to spot enemies, but I just can't see them, so I give up trying to fight back and bolt it toward one of my team-mates (the marksman from before). (By this time, there were only like three or four of us left.) He was patching himself up, so I helped him out by bandaging him up a little. We're both switching between prone and crouching stances, trying to shoot the enemy and patch ourselves up as we get shot. Eventually, it's just us two, there's still gunfire, but it's died down a little. He turns to me 'So, what do you think we should do?', I reply 'I think we should just make a run for it'.   And so we do.   He has more stamina than me, considering I'm carrying about 40 rolls of bandages, 80 syringes and several litres of blood, so I naturally fall behind. I try to run full on even after running out of stamina, but I get shot in the head and my character hits the deck. Luckily, the wound isn't fatal so I take some cover and quickly patch myself up and inject some morphine into me. (At this point I think I'm basically a high mummy.) I try to keep up with my squad-mate... but I take more gunfire which causes me to take cover... and when I do, I hear mortar fire.  A mortar hits the ground right in front of me...   And I live. My Torso is badly damaged but I live, so I start bandaging myself and giving myself morphine... but then I hear another mortar...  And I still live. And then another... Still alive. And then another... Still alive. And then I die.  I respawn back at our forward base... my team mate manages to make it back without dying. He is the only survivor.  2) This a story from some random KoTH server. A helicopter pilot does a parachute run over the capture area. I jump out, aiming toward a tower that had friendlies occupying it before, that I still assumed had friendlies inside. I manoeuvre myself as I drop, and I'm about to miss the tower but I manage to pull it in and just land on the edge where a man was standing... 'Crawford killed xxxx' ... oh, that was an enemy... and I... crushed him? I look over to the other guy on the tower... he's patching himself up with a bandage... and I shoot him. I rank up, and some music plays.   I replay in my head the events that have just occurred. -I parachuted onto a tower -Drop kicked the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of a guy as I land -Kill his friend -Awesome music played  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yeah.
3593	1	a	A game in which AI infantry can headshot you, while you're inside of a jet going supersonic. 10/10

3619	1	a	I broke the rules but im not a rapper
3621	1	a	The best game I ever played
3623	1	a	This game is truly awesome..
3625	1	a	It was just a normal day in Invasion and Annex (A coop gamemode entirely community made that teams up the whole playerbase against AI, usually 50 as the player cap), I had taken Explosive Specialist and I was waiting at base to get teamed up with a squad. And holyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I couldnt of gotten a better one.  First delpoyment was a cakewalk, so we decided to just get dropped off near the objective without ressuplying at base. 'We will take an airdrop' they said. So we half-resupplyed along the way. The next thing we know, we have been pinned down and holding our ground by literally all of the enemy forces in the point since the other squad wasnt doing a good enough job. Our medic got killed by a granade launcher, we ran out of first aid kits. So we threw some smoke and dragged the wounded away while me and our machinegunner covered, it was chaos. We held for about 20 minutes until â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing base finally decided to send in medical evac. But not even that, instead of a chopper to get us out of that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing place, they sent another medic. At that point, I had ran out of ammo and was borrowing HE granades from the squad leader to use as mortars for targets that were 500 meters away.  Somehow we managed to push into the village, kill everything, and evac. I dont think a game has made me consistently feel knees deep in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for 2 hours or so. If you like to get shot down from the sky by AA guns and having really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cool scenarios, get this game right now.   TL;DR enjoy being pinned down by troops for hours while you have no supplies and your allies back at base are circle jerking. Buy it. 
3627	1	a	very cool and realistic game. enjoyed playing this in the short time that i did but was fantastic. there is also a huge mod and extras selection for the game too, so there's a lot to do. well worth the price and would recommend buying this. i also was playing with specs almost the minimum requirements so i cant fully say how graphical it is as i didn't have them up on full but iv'e also seen videos on full graphics and its incredible.
3629	1	a	a fun game to play solo or with friends with better modding system than arma 2 10/10
3631	1	a	Arma 3 - Where the minimum requirements are made up and your PC specs don't matter.  10/10 would average 30 FPS again.
3633	1	a	Should you buy this games? YES Is it a MMO and Shooting? YES Do you love it? YES Is it like dayZ Standalone? DO YOU HAVE BRAIN ISSUE? Is there Roleplay Server? YES AND THERE CHICKEN ON THE ROAD Is the community Friendly? IDK IF YOU ARE A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WELL EXPECT THEY WONT BE FRIENDLY  This personnaly is like the best i ever play i met some awesome people and plus they all love Lord Gaben so you should buy this games because you will enjoy shooting bald head on altis server and enter in roleplay situation.  This games is a wild beat -Rock Paper Nuke  I love Chicken -IGN Noob Clan  Is there some Zombie? -Bald Head From Kavala  Can i drift in this games? -Team Drift Monkey  Is There a guy call KoolAid? -Agent Nikodim :P  Remember this is my opinion there a lot of other review by some other people !ENJOY!   -Agent Nikodim

3651	1	a	Arma is love, Arma is life.
3653	1	a	Don't expect much from the campaign. But wow, if you have a good PC, the multiplayer and mods (like Arma 2 did) will quite possibly change the way you look at video games.
3655	1	a	Pretty good game for the most part. I have learned alot of with this game, i've created alot of unique content and met alot of nice people!
3657	1	a	Dont have the game yet, but It's giving me a chance to give it a review anyways so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it.   10/10
3659	1	a	Really fun until a ten year old yells at you for not being tactical enough.
3661	1	a	The most famous of the classic blunders, we're told, is getting involved in a land war in Asia. Arma III should be at a healthy remove then, centered as it is around the battle for a fictional Mediterranean archipelago. It certainly plays all the right cards: vaguely foreboding news montages, not-so-vague allusions to real-world conflicts, and realistic weaponry and other military miscellanea. Here is the modern shooter, dressed for success.  But what's to be said for the wisdom of appending a campaign mode to a game that has traditionally been appreciated as a multiplayer creative suite? There's a blunder for the modern era. The Arma series is known foremost as a platform: a malleable assembly of characters and military objects, and rules to govern their behavior. Modding enthusiasts leverage in-game editors and a relatively ungated code structure to produce their own playable content in lieu of formal designs, and to great effect. It was odd, then, to see some lamenting the relegation of Arma III's campaign to three downloadable post-release entries. There's a stubborn canard that asserts a video game's single-player campaign, if offered, must be its nominal flagship, even when in practice it's a secondary (or tertiary) concern for player and developer alike.   But a campaign was promised, and so a campaign must be delivered. NATO forces are in the midst of a drawdown on the island of Stratis, when the once-friendly local forces lash out in a surprise attack. A multistage affair ensues, playing out in a dull triptych: Survive. Adapt. Win. The grunt tasked with doing that surviving, adapting, and winning is one Corporal Kerry, who reacts to every order he's given with a beleaguered protest ('You want me to do what??'), which is a curious trait for a soldier with a non-zero amount of experience. You, as Kerry, take on an escalating part in an escalating war, eventually graduating from a follower role on Stratis' meager 20 square kilometers to commanding a squad on Altis and its staggering 270 square kilometers. There are a few vague allusions to an overarching plot involving a British black-ops group and some suspicious earthquakes, but neither plot point stakes much of a claim on the proceedings.  The campaign is a strange beast, torn between an earnest attempt to render the tedium and dispassionate remove that color modern warfare, and the Hollywood bombast that colors Modern Warfare a la Call of Duty. This is the sort of conflict where acronyms (NATO, FIA) fight acronyms (CSAT, AAF) over acronyms (LZs, OPs). But it's also the sort where trite wartime quotes fill the interstitial screens, and where the only attempt to characterize the enemy force is an epithet--'greenback'--that's occasionally spat. Arma III is content to let you idle while an ally goes through a lengthy, inaudible, and ultimately inconsequential discussion with a checkpoint guard, or direct you to report in to characters whose only purpose is to refer you over to talk to your commanding officer a few yards away. It restricts your character's movement speed to a controlled jog--elbows in, gun stock squarely nestled on the shoulder--and sends you humping across the hills and valleys of Altis for miles without encountering anything worth loosing a round at. Then an electric guitar wails, a bomber starts strafing your position, and you're forced to bug out at the same ponderous pace that you entered with seconds ago.  The fractured nature of Arma III's campaign makes for an uneven experience at best, but that variability does have an accentuating effect when things fall into a more natural stride. For one, there's a real fragility to Kerry and his unit. So when Bohemia dangles the carrot of an escape helicopter before you at the end of one grueling mission, and then snatches it away with an untimely bit of antiaircraft fire, Kerry's horror-struck pleas of 'no no No No NO!' take on a bitter pathos. The introduction of the island of Altis is another high point, presenting a rigorous mission that sees Kerry attempting to rearm and regroup after being stranded behind enemy lines. When Arma III isn't trying to show off a fancy new military gadget or weave in its half-baked tale of black-ops intrigue, when it's leaning on the more tangible drama of a botched rescue or frantic coms chatter, it simmers in a way most shooters can't.  It helps that your forces aren't punctuating every explosion with a string of expletives, of course. But for the better part of the campaign I supplied my own. Not two skirmishes into the Survive campaign's relatively tame first level, it seems I'd already died more times than I had in the entirety of Dark Souls, and that game's motto is 'Prepare to Die.' I'd hop off five-foot-tall ledges and crumple into a bloody heap. I'd get gunned down while looking at the full screen map, after being prompted to look at the map. I'd open up the help menu for instructions on some trial-by-fire task, and get killed while reading them. I'd succumb to razor-accurate shots fired by enemies in distant hills, enemies who never seemed to have a scope on their guns when I eventually overcame them. Some of these instances were learning experiences, and not soon repeated. Others felt like side effects of the campaign's delay and piecemeal release schedule--what Arma veteran would have welcomed a long-awaited mode that leads with a thorough introduction to controls he or she is already familiar with?  The campaign is a strange beast, torn between an earnest attempt to render the tedium and dispassionate remove that color modern warfare, and the Hollywood bombast that colors Modern Warfare a la Call of Duty.  Arma III uses the full keyboard for its array of possible actions, split between personal affairs like toggling flashlights and binoculars, and issuing orders to your squad. Much of the heavy lifting is foisted on the mousewheel, of all things, which scrolls through contextual actions for almost anything that's to be done in the game. The controls alternate between instrumental and overly finicky, but they never cease to be an aspect of Arma III that requires constant attention. The unwieldiness does lend combat a certain gravitas, however. Most modern shooters grant an athletic flourish to the act of killing; here, the satisfaction of downing an enemy comes from the knowledge that he won't be shooting at you anymore, not in how adroitly you head-shotted him.  There isn't such a positive spin to be put on Arma III's artificial intelligence, however. It's particularly damning, because the strategic underpinnings require a close coordination with squadmates that the game's engine isn't prepared to give. Teammates follow commands at their leisure, if they follow them at all. During one marathon trek across the island, I reached my destination with only two of my eight-man squad in tow. Looking back from the top of our hilltop destination, I could chart the lost squad members like dropped breadcrumbs--one trapped on a rock, four frozen solid in the middle of a field, and the last determined never to leave the two-story building he'd wandered into of his own volition. All attempts to order a regroup returned a chorus of firm but vexing 'Negative.' So much for 'no man gets left behind,' then.

3663	1	a	Played the Altis life mod.... ran into a safe zone with a bunch of cops, got arrested for no reason.. Got put into a police car (They have no idea what's about to happen) i had weed on me... I smoked the weed in the police car, infront of all the cops... then.... Boom, the car exploded and all the weeds was gone :(
3665	1	a	Die for falling 3M 10/10 would play agian IGN
3667	1	a	I look for maximum replayability and good mooding support in games and this one meets and even excedes these expectations. - Wide range of multiplayer modes and server types  You can play with you and a friend in co-op or in a massive player saturated server. - Easy access of mods  Downloading mods is a breeze with an easily accessable place to put and activate all of your mods. - Make and play your own missions and other's  With a easy to use mission editor, you can create the ideal battle to your liking.  In conclusion I rate this 9/10 - Would get ran over with a strider again.
3669	1	a	Really,Really Good. I would highly recomend it to a new player or old player for PC! Definatley a game you need to buy!
3671	1	a	Self entitlement simulator, when you call the shots in your squad and you kill other players this crazy self entitlement kicks in and you spit hektick as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ self entitlement at your squad mates, 'yeah see I told, I knew to come this way' 'bro don't doubt the queef' 'I know this s h i t bro, thats why I got 350 hours on it' 'didn't I tell you there was weapons caches here?' 'Bro trust I know my s h i t' 'detz whi Iym de bezt because trep armz bre'
3673	1	a	Played campaign Called to Kamino base for no reason Commander gets killed Base gets attacked Stranded in woods with friend Friend dies Walking through forest alone Find some Brit Navy dudes on the radio Walk around bad guys to other stranded guys Walking to Brit Navy boat Ambushed in forest One shotted from 600yds  10/10 would have John Marston AI aim and linear cliche campaign again
3675	1	a	real combat - walk around  back hurts tired bored finally get some action call in  wait for approval to engage shoot like 3 rounds  artillery â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up keep walking get CIB  yey
3677	1	a	I don't even know where to start. This is the #1 military simulator in the world. I loved BF and AA but omg this is something that no game can compete with. The reality factor is unbelievable (yes yes some things still need work, like tire explosions and some vehicle control but it's the best it gets so far). All the aspects they need to improve aren't a big deal because they have a huge and amazing developer's team which keeps releasing amazing updates and HUGE DLC's and bunch of extra content.   Honestly, you don't need to read any review unless you're looking for very specific detail. Watch their promo video heree and go on their forums to learn the most. You don't need to read a lengthy review to know this is one of the best games ever made. GET IT GET IT GET IT. Do NOT wait for it to drop in price (it does here and there) Just get the Digital Deluxe Edition and all of the DLC's. You spend 50-60 bucks on games which you beat in under 100 hours or even under 20 hours. You'll spend $100-$200 on ArmA3 but expect HUNDREDS and THOUSANDS of game time. There is ALWAYS something new to do. TONS of game types and OMG if you play with a friend or let alone a LAN party, that's the best it gets, it's so much fun. An amazing community consisted of military enthusiasts and active soldiers and veterans as well as Emergency Response personnel like Fire Fighters, Police Officers and Paramedics. Why does it matter? Becaause these men and women know how to takeand give orders. How to make a simulator like ArmA feel as if you're actually in there. Just do yourselves a favor. Stop saving for whatever you're saving, stop reading this and go buy the game. Then start saving again :)   My Rating: 9.5/10 I know it's tough to make everything perfect but things like vehicle and aircraft control need to feel a bit more real (most of them do but some are just so frustrating) also little things like when your tire blows up, it shouldn't just disappear lol... That's why you didn't get a full 10/10. Those small things, really do matter. Some people will hate on me for saying that but I am sorry, many would agree with me. I couldn't give it less than 9.5/10 because even though they still need some work on some objects in the game, it's the best I have ever seen, ever. Nothing get's this real and collaborative. The team play in this game is unbelievably crucial for success. Most of the time it's plain suicide to go solo. This is as real as it gets (behind a computer monitor). Have fun. Make ArmA, Not War.     Bottom Line: Kids play Battlefield, Boys play America's Army, Men play ArmA.   
3679	1	a	This game is an amazing game the great graphics, although it takes quite a demanding PC to experience the game fully. I would highly recomend this game if you are in RP or realistik shooting tanks jets it goes on and on.
3681	1	a	Killed terrorists.  10/10 would buy again.
3683	1	a	Overall great game. Although I don't see the point in making a 'mil sim' revolve around technology that isin't invented and probably never will be. The fun in a sim is seeing real life guns, tanks, fighters and heli's. We all know Fairchild Aircraft wont be making a next gen warthog and that no carribean country will ever have a military worth fearing. It tries so hard to be realistic and far fetched at the same time. Although one could argue that arma 2's 'current time' military equipment can just be ported over, it'll never be in 'muh glorious high poly models' as arma 3's.   7/10
3685	1	a	The rolling hills lay majestically in front of us. On my right was my brother, eager to eliminate enemies. On my left was my best friend, scanning the area for vehicles. Behind me was our squad of 5, awaiting my command. I looked forward and spotted an enemy squad making their way towards us. I crouched and whispered 'Enemy Spotted'. I was not going to lose a man today. I would get them out. I would escape from Stratis.
3687	1	a	This game leaves me speachless I always liked to call Arma 'Military Simulator' because it is the most realistic shooter and combined-arms game you will ever play (that is of course, until there is an arma 4)  This game is great for the serious and the least serious.... with workshop support for RP, mods, zombies, wastelands, Tactical operations and more......  FACT: this review can't even scratch the surface of how good Arma is........ You will just have to look around, maybe watch some videos, maybe buy the game..... But I don't have enough time to describe this, I NEED to get back to playing it......
3689	1	a	You can play as a rabbit.
3691	1	a	its fun for a couple of hours
3693	1	a	I got killed by binoculars...  10/10  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=494392957 
3695	1	a	It has Turtles. 10/10
3697	1	a	Downloaded it with a group of my friends, loaded into a DayZ mod server and got kitted. Eight of us walking through a valley happily kitted. One loan gunner on a hill in what i'm convinced was a different map took us all down. 10/10 would get PTSD again
3699	1	a	I love this game to put it simply. 10/10 Can do almost anything in this game, well worth the money in my opinion!
3701	1	a	Amazing game, would totally reccomend who have been fans of the Arma series
3703	1	a	Came for Exile.... Stayed for everything
3705	1	a	The game is a lot of fun, it improves on a lot of aspects of Arma 2 while adding more features. The only downsides I've found, are the anticheat system (same crappy one that Arma 2 had), FPS drops are awful (even with a fairly beefy PC), physics are a bit odd from time to time, and the setting being a near future one, which I'm not a huge fan of. Mods, however, could be a great solution to the last 2 negative points.
3707	1	a	Possibly my favourite game of all time! yep I said it!  ARMA has so much going for it, large sandbox environments, a wealth of community created and official content, a great editor in the right hands and couple that with a good clan and your set for gaming life! Yes it has its bugs and yes the single player isn't the greatest but the multiplayer Co-ops enjoyed with the right group of people will bring you an experience that no other game or community can currently match. This is the game that keeps on giving and brings me back to PC gaming again and again....consoles have no answer to this game...back to PC gaming then :)
3709	1	a	If you like realistic shooter you have founded the right game
3711	1	a	On the first day of Christmas Arma gave to me this annoying d*ck piece of sh*t laaaaaaaag I mean seriously, optimise it pls because sometimes in areas with lots of buildings you get a drop from 60 to 15 fps and in general it is very CPU-dependant game. And for all the addons you have to pay loads of money, but i guess the quality kinda compensates it but still. Apart from that I think this is the most realistic and fun to play at the same time war simulator and I totally recommend it. P.S. Also the community is very nice and friendly on most servers, so it's so much fun to play with them + loads of different gamemodes and workshop stuff make the game so much better and gives you so many different things that you get to experience (I put this separately because I don't think it links to the development of the game itself, but more of community stuff, but I find it important information for the people who want to buy this game).
3713	1	a	To be fair, ArmA 3 is the best BI game since ArmA 2.  It has so much more to offer, both mods-wise as well as possibilities.  The mission editor is very well thought out compared to ArmA 2's.  Most, if not all of the weapons and vehicles are futuristic enough that as a player, they look and behave realisticly enough to be believable.  A few things that I also feel enhance the gameplay are the RHS unit and faction mod, as well as the ACE3 medical mod and the ACRE Radio mod.  Other than that, having played well over 1,000 hours on this, anyone purchasing this game will find it well worth your money.
3715	1	a	One of the first games I've had to be sober to play, I was worried that if I wasn't everyone would look at me as a s****ty soldier. It feels that real. The only thing missing is Article-15's.
3717	1	a	10/10
3719	1	a	A really good game and defynetly the most realistic FPS out there. It requires strategy and teamplay. Its really hard and has a SUPER steep lerning couve (like 89Â°). The only issiue i have with it is that you have to buy all the DLCÂ´sto be able to play on multiplayer Servers. I personally really enjoyed Altis life. If you are planning to buy it, i definatly recommend it (with all DLC)!
3721	1	a	This game isn't battlefield bad game nor does it have a big map like planetside. This game isn't the best game ever. It's just better than most and IT'S it's own game.
3723	1	a	For me personally, the best game I ever bought!!! Got it all, graphics, action, gameplay, teamwork, making new Arma buddies.... 
3725	1	a	the game is ok.
3727	1	a	Arma 3 is the true sequel to the beloved Operation Flashpoint (Or as itâ€™s known on steam as Arma: Cold War Assault.)   I say that, because as an old school flashpoint â€œget of my lawnâ€ guy, Arma 3 is the first truly unique version of the Flashpoint formula that just feels right. OFP is one the best games of all time, nobody forgets being abandoned on Everon, with nothing but your M16 and hundreds of Soviets between you and the evac ship. Or as Victor Troska leading the Resistance and throwing that T55 between buildings just so that Hind canâ€™t snipe you with a rocket. And all of the mods, all of them. (Hereâ€™s looking at you FFUR, ECP, FDF, BW) But, alas back to the task at hand. Eventually the first Arma came out.    Arma was fun mostly because it was like OFP with new graphics which was nice for a while, but something about it just wasnâ€™t that enthralling, it felt like the game was shooting for the extra point and missed. Not very far off, but enough to just feel a little to hollow. I also have fond memories of the campaign breaking on multiple occasions, the gigantic lag spikes in MP, and the absolutely hilarious voiceovers. â€œ2 FALL BACK INTO FOORMATIOOOON.â€ Oh and that disappointing AI pathfinding, I remember screaming 'Just go into the damn house!' When I was using the editor, but Sergai felt like he should just hang outside of the doorway then awkwardly crane his neck at the oncoming enemy. Then to rub salt on the wound, do the classic snail sidestep turn slightly right until he got drilled in the head by an M4 round. It was like OFP 1 1/3.    Arma 2 came along as the unoptimized buggy mess it was, and I couldnâ€™t really get into it. The fact that when you loaded the coop campaign and you couldnâ€™t even get out the ship doors to start it, was not the best first impression. But it did have the funniest\saddest line Iâ€™ve ever heard uttered from a voice actor. â€œSTAND DOWN SOLDIER, STAND THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DOWN.â€ And letâ€™s not forget â€œSPREAD WIDER THEN A THAI HOOKERS THIGHS, HOORAA.â€ In that high pitch squeaky voice. So thank you Arma 2 for that. There were some parts of it though, that were getting better. And, I believe the mod support was what saved it. And there was Sergai again, back for round two. All I wanted him to do was to go in that damn house, just once to go into the house. 'YOU CAN DO IT SERGAI!' I exclaimed as the M4 round sailed into his head again while he was doing the crane head sidestep dance. It was like OFP 1 2/3rdsâ€¦    Finally, as they say, 3rd times a charm - Arma 3 came along and I fell in love all over again, a game better than the sum of its parts, a game with actual voice acting, the fact that it actually takes itself seriously, decent writing, a completely revamped physics engine, a game that is polished and clean, just like the original. The units and story are cool and inventive. I love the campaign and all the new mission editor tools, like virtual arsenal. The flashpoint formula finally stepped into the next century with this game. I recommend it whole heartedly, even as the bitter old war veteran who was playing FDF coop campaign with friends in Europe back in 2005. Not to mention the community and mod support tools are amazing, and in full swing. Not only that, but the game is updated all the time and now, for the first time ever we even have a 3D Editor! How neat is that? Sergai will now not only go into the house, but he can patrol it, check around cover, AND HE DOESN'T SIDESTEP SNAIL TURN ANYMORE, this time he can finally get the drop on that enemy, the world is your's Sergai. Thank you Bohemia for bringing flashpoint back.
3729	1	a	I spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out how to land a helo. I then ran to a bluefor FOB to group with a few allies. We proceed to move slowly around the FOB area for our objective. One of our guys, Cel, gets shot from somewhere inside a town. Proceed to call in air support to see if they can help us find the shooter. Air support cant see anything but we are sure Cel got shot form in the town.  Cel asks our squad leader if we should just arty the town. Squad leader gives the go ahead and we turn the little town into dust.  Best game ever
3731	1	a	the game i have been looking for since i played operation flashpoint but couldnt afford a pc but im here ;) THIS GAME IS NOT CALL OF DUTY OR BATTLEFIELD this is true military shooter
3733	1	a	Had an enemy who was about to steal my truck in the sights of my Sniper I took the shot, only to realise I hadn't zeroed in my scope, and shot out the tire of my own truck instead, whilst alerting the enemy, who proceeded to kill me while verbally assaulting me in Russian 23/10 -Too many tires
3735	1	a	  Good and realy fun I like the campaign but I like the multiplayer more Its one of the most realistic miletery game ever
3737	1	a	arma 3 is a great game but i wish i would have known about the free weekend a bit earlier so i could injoy it a bit more. even with two days of the game i got to experince alot like all the funny mini games and the amazing campain. i would for sure buy this game if i were you.
3739	1	a	I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I've spent most of the time riding in a helicopter and then getting blown up but hey IT LOOKS SO FUN
3741	1	a	Do not buy this game if you only play conventional shooters. Buy this game if you are willing to sit down and learn a surprisingly advanced Mil Sim. (If you play Altis Life, I want you dead).
3743	1	a	10/10 look boodyful would bang. It is fun, cool, and I have fun playing it, but pretty boring by yourself I would try and get into a group of players to play with or join a gang on a good altis life server, you get the idea play with others it's even better.
3745	1	a	This game is a very great Game!  It's definitly worth the money!   Pros:
3747	1	a	ARMA 3 -   While most of my time on this game has been on multiplayer servers, I can at least give a review on that aspect of the game.   So far, it has been very enjoyable. Improvements have been made and many of the annoying bugs (such as dying on stairs) have been fixed. Community mod support is excellent and has helped create things like Exile and Breaking Point.  The game is NOT very well optimized and this something that needs MAJOR work. My GTX 980 sometimes gets 20FPS on some servers.  But, overall, gameplay is great, community is great, physics are...semi-great.  8/10
3749	1	a	awsome game
3751	1	a	Very fun game! Though dont play if you don't know â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about teamwork!
3753	1	a	A small child was micspamming the entire audio from Monsters Inc. and then he died from falling from a plane.  It's pretty good.
3755	1	a	3,000+ Hours,  Still can't shoot for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3757	1	a	Hope you have a good computer
3759	1	a	controls as complex as female minds
3761	1	a	Great game but needs better optimization. Even my Intel i5-4690 and a GTX 1070 cannot run this
3763	1	a	This game is awesome, picked it up in steam summer sale, started playing a week later. 100 hours in, bought DLC, killed lots of zombies, sniped lots of people and had lots of laughs. Pull the trigger on it commander, its really good. RIP LYF? Roger that.
3765	1	a	Fun game, You can play for hours and the thrill remains, Besure to have good CPU, RAM, and Gpu
3767	1	a	Man my dreams came true of becoming a soldier thanks arma 3 ðŸ‘
188	0	a	&gt;Flying at 1,300 meters &gt;Traveling at 500 knots &gt;single rifleman headshots me through canopy &gt;crash and burn 10/10
3769	1	a	FPS Game without a bomb site
3771	1	a	Uhh... Go to heroin fields for muney.
3773	1	a	This is a very good game.
3775	1	a	Action packed and super fun at times! :) A good pc is recomended.
3777	1	a	First you play this game and your like oh okay this is cool. Then you get mods and never leave your computer again.. 10/10 Would lose Social Life Again.
3779	1	a	By far, the best first person shooter I've played.
3781	1	a	Very challenging and very fun. A experience unlike any other.
3783	1	a	Nice game but soometimes a little bit laggy.
3785	1	a	Bought this game a while ago on a recommendation from a friend. That asshat doesn'r realize how my life has been ruined by this now.
3787	1	a	IMO Game is ok, not for the faint of heart or easily upset.  
3789	1	a	The moments you can have in this game are unbelievable. This game makes your heart beat go to a million in 1 second. The tense and amazing times you have with friends or strangers is truley a game you need to have in your Steam Libary. Also the graphics in this game is astonishing, even if you dont like the simulated war game anybody with a beast PC should have his game because of the amount of detail put in Arma 3 is a game to sit back and watch the view.
3791	1	a	If you love having to press 36 different key combinations in order to crouch behind a rock, this game is for you.
3793	1	a	Reaching my 200th hour on this game made me decide to write a review. To start, this game has hooked me for 200 hours of tactical combat over the last 4/5 months or so. (Yes I did buy it at Christmas, so what.) I came to this game from its prequel. I mainly played Wasteland but did a bit of Domination. I loaded that game up on Christmas day and the main menu music already had me hooked. I browsed for wasteland servers and oh boy did I find one. Started up as BLUFOR and noticed my teammates were actually not shooting me, which was a variation from the prequel. Also the UI wasn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and navigating felt more logical. I soon discovered 77th JSOC and then I have spent all of my free time on that. Wibble, if you're reading this, never let that guy in the AMV-7 again, he TK'd my whole squad. :( â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing great game and HALF DECENT community.  But the bugs. Plenty of laughter to them, and they're no longer game breaking. Play this game. Or I will forever hate you.
3795	1	a	The best(and hardest) first/third person war simulator out there. Period.
3797	1	a	Hello guys Legion is back plz feel free to come and check out our altis wasteland server that we are currently running. We would love to have you as long as you are mature and enjoy gaming with a mature gaming community. we are also developing the server and and we do take suggestions so if you're interested in having your opinions heard and valued please feel free to check us out. Also since we are just starting out and we predict that we will blossom quickly better join now and get your farming for $$$ fast before we are full and multiple people are doing the missions
3799	1	a	I threw a cabbage at a cat and it ate me. -30/carrots
3801	1	a	I SAY Play it its a great game :D
3803	1	a	Found a guy in Breaking Point. Said he was friendly, had a helicopter. Went in a car. Hooked my car. Said quote' Where to' Then dropped me all of a sudden  Best Trolling gamer ever IGN- 50/10
3805	1	a	*Buys game on sale* *Downloads exile* *Gets amazing gear* *dies by AI* *Gets stuff back* *dies again by the same AI* 11/10 buy this game
3807	1	a	The modifications are the best part of this game.  Had a good time on the  Reallife RPG  server and don't regret spending almost a week of my life there.
3809	1	a	It's ok
3811	1	a	this game is a good game
3813	1	a	8/8 m8 i have too many hours on this game. It's just arma 2 with better graphics and better everything else.
3815	1	a	I'm not going to make this review long as hell like other ones. Just the aspects, the good and the bad...  The game is very realistic in the year and what they think 2037 would look like in combat. AAF are against the army, I don't know the full story but I know some of it to say what has been going on *no spoilers* Realistic in running, aiming, shooting, cover, stealth. Overall a very good game for realistic players like me and none of that COD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.   The bad So there are not that many bad things I gotta say. First off they need to add melee in ARMA 4 because its a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥. secondly there are some minor bugs I've noticed but none to make the game unplayable. It's still very good overall. So lastly Nobody plays the game that much and if they are, it's usually ARMA 3 APEX edition, but I'm not going to spend 40$ on something that should be 20$. Multiplayer can be a hassle when getting places around the huge map.   I would suggest you buy it at the recommended sale price for 20$ or lower because I got it for that much. It is a great game overall though and I can't wait for the next one!
3817	1	a	Alright I think its time I do my part and write a review on Arma 3, I've been playing the Arma series since the DayZ mod was released, it's in all honesty why I even got into PC gaming, now with Arma 3 being released a couple years later with way better graphics, physics, VON, mods, ect. I could not stop playing. I still play Arma 3 till this day, and sorry for the short review, gotta go play.
3819	1	a	my arma 3 (p much just wasteland) experience thus far:  1. get ar 2. get landmines 3. set landmines on blind curve in highway 4. loot poor brasilian pubbie that hits it 5. hide in woods, camp wreck 6. shoot more brasilian pubbies 7. repeat
3821	1	a	Legend has it, you can hear your computer scream as you play
3823	1	a	Good Milism game. Not the most realistic, but it's very hardcore and fun. Definetly made for multiplayer and mods. If you buy this, make sure to try out these game modes, King of the Hill, Wasteland, Exile, and Variations of these with different maps and mods.
3825	1	a	  THIS game needs a GOOD PC TO RUN ON
3827	1	a	Wait, you're scrolling through the reviews as if you need to be convinced to buy this masterpiece?  Sometimes I lose faith in humanity.
3829	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ play COD  Boys play battlefield   Real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in men with balls play arma
3831	1	a	realistic army simulator, with modern weapons, wehicles and terrains, which are the size of a small contries. The game has a huge learning curve for an FPS shooter, has Map editor to make a war scenarios on your own for MP as SP, and huge mod support for all sort of content, where game shines the most
3833	1	a	This is my absolute most favorite game that I have ever played. I don't say that often. When I first started to play Arma back in Arma 2, I had the hardest time learning the controls. But it didn't take long to learn the controls and get the character movement down, even though this is the one game that was the most difficult for me to learn all the controls with. Now that I have played it and tried all the game modes played on many different servers, I am now having the most fun playing a video game than ever before. Also, I LOVE flying helicopters. I can now pull off some crazy stunts that most pilots don't even want to try. My favorite 'mode' or 'mod' to play now is Arma 3 Overpoch. Brings together all the old guns and vehicles that I used back in Arma 2, and the new weapons and vehicles that Arma 3 has to offer. Hands down best game I have ever had the pleasure of having in my steam library. I give this game a solid 10/10.
3835	1	a	I was in a heli , on my way to the sky i saw a squad of 4 people was flying almost over them shout in direct communication ALLAHU ACKBAR and crash the heli into them.   heli/4 would allahu ackbar again.
3837	1	a	every single day i play this game and every single time a play it i get a boner and when i go to bed i sneak it in my room and play it but i get caught by my grandma and she says to me 'Listen you little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i told you to go to bed and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off' i cry evri teim and i wish i can fly away and play this every day and i watch gameplay and i masturbate
3839	1	a	Bought Arma 3 for Altis Life Mod. Became a rebel. shot a cop for chasing me. saved people from going to jail. Made a gang. done a drug run. got robbed.   10/10 ign
3841	1	a	People deliberately run into my truck to give me a $1000 fine. Worst community of all time. Greatest game of all time. 
3843	1	a	I suck at this game.  10/10
3845	1	a	i played it.
3847	1	a	This game is truly great. If you want a no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t FPS shooter, no 360 headshots or rage. I highly recommend this game. Now there is some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t suchs as phsyics and how vehicels work over terrain. But I have never ran into any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t during a firefight or trying to execute some missions. If you want to play a game that will waste your time, and be pretty at the same time. Get this, its almost like a virtual girlfriend.
3849	1	a	Never again will I paly arma 3 campaign the gun recoil is terrible and the AI are way to over powerd it is shocking campaign  and it needs to be sorted
3851	1	a	I have no words. Boheimia Interactive has done it again, this time on an even grander and more immersive scale than the last. Alone, this game is amazing. With friends, this game is amazing. With food, this game is amazing. Masturbating, it is amazing. Did i mention that its amazing?
3853	1	a	love this game totaly worth every penny
3855	1	a	Still dont know how to fly a plane  10/10
3857	1	a	IZ THE BOMB I R8 8
3859	1	a	Arma 3 is basically GTA 5 with a military mod.  11/10 for the GTA 5-ness.
3861	1	a	So we're on a hill, there's an apc and 5 guys waiting to attack a base, i hear a truck drive up and assume its my teamamtes, boy was i wrong, i heard someone scream ALLAHU AKBAR, thats when i realised that wasnt my teammates and i had messed up... i died, cried, and respawned   ALLAHU/10 would get blown up again
3863	1	a	There's a key mapped to literally every function of the human body, not to mention your weapons, gear, and mentality. 11/10 would press 6 keys to look down iron sights again
3865	1	a	I never played ARMA II. I've probably spent all the time in ARMA III in the 77th JSOC server. Amazing server and an amazing community just in the base game. The game has a solid singleplayer campaign that takes place on two greek islands (without cyclopses unfortuanely) where you play as a soldier fighting for your and your field corps' survival.  Highly realistic, great SP campaign, great MP, has an active modding scene, a lot of DLC updates that doesn't split the community. It's hard to not recommend this fantastic title!
3867	1	a	Good game , but in that game , it's some bugs , what will create you some nervers :) With that update is a lot gooder that last. Happy play :D
3869	1	a	This game is one of my top 3, it is a realistic war simulator at its finest along with the many popular game modes such as altis life, king of the hill, and wasteland. The story is one of the best stories i have played in a long time and to put icing on the cake it was released in 2013. I dont even think i have to start on the maps, weapons, and vehicles. Even the 33 things about arma 3 video above cant go into detail without stretching the video to about 3 hours. 10/10 would play again
3871	1	a	this is the most realistic game i've ever played
3873	1	a	Realistic modern-war simulator to date. Although it is notorious for it's poor optimization (mostly in multiplayer), the game runs well in singleplayer if the recommended system requirements were met.
3875	1	a	LIKE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER? BUY THIS GAME!  LIKE THIRD PERSON SHOOTER? BUY THIS GAME!  LIKE MULTIPLAYER SANDBOX, SURVIVAL, MODS, AND REALISTIC â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? BUY THIS GAME!  JUST â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BUY IT GODAMIT BEST $60 I SPET IN MY LIFE!   
3877	1	a	Great game!
3879	1	a	i still dont know all the controls
3881	1	a	-Joins Dayz server -Spawn -Dies -Respawns -Finds Axe -Dies Again -Leaves to find new Dayz server -Finds new server -Spawns -Finds a gun on every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing doorstep -Kills other player -Gets shot at once more -Runs into the forest -Dies of hunger in the forest  10/10
3883	1	a	This is by far the best combat simulator on the PC market.
3885	1	a	10/10 nothing to say pure realism
3887	1	a	Simply the best game I ever played  
3889	1	a	Better than I expected, Conflicts are pretty good. You won't get bored while you are experiencing Arma 3. However, It's different then any other Action game since it includes a lot of details in it in general. It's pretty worth it.
3891	1	a	Awesome graphics and gameplay while in multiplayer, but the learning curve is off the hook.
3893	1	a	Note\'s:  No screaming kids. Check No aim assist. Check Easy mod support. Check Great and healthy community. Check  In this game you can live out your life doing hardcore drugs. Go into a giant battle royal. Or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es up!  a must buy on sale. BUY IT!
3895	1	a	Love this game but have to make a new steam and buy another because it said i hacked so now I cant play multiplayer
3897	1	a	played the tutorial,i already love the game
3899	1	a	Amazing game. Exile and battle royal and other multiplayer games are a ton of fun.
3901	1	a	This game is the best realistic 1st person shooter,  Pros -Photo realistic graphics -Countless hours of playbility -Fun with mods Cons -Lag 10/10 would play with friends
3903	1	a	This game is great. The mechanics, weapons, modes, are all awesome. My biggest issue is the optimization, which, depending on your personal preference, may render it unplayable. I'm running an AMD FX-8350 along with a GTX 970 with 4 GB of VRAM, and I can barely hold 30 frames in the multiplayer, even on low settings. For the most part it will run at about 25 FPS. In the single player I can usually get around 45 FPS or so, but not much more.   It really seems like they did not optimize the game what-so-ever. Personally, I don't mind the occassional frame drop, but it is certainly annoying seeing as how realistic the game is. My CPU and GPU should be more than enough to have this game completely maxed out at 60 FPS with no drops. Unfortunately though, they really didn't do anything with the game's optimization.  I still think it's fun, but if frame drops or a low frame rate bother you, I'd stay very far away. I imagine even on super high end hardware it would still have considerable issues.
3905	1	a	I once had a life
3907	1	a	I've played this game more than any other I own. With the vast collection of mods available, there is an infanant numbers of ways to play. I personally enjoy playing modded COOP games with friends and implementing some of the many realism mods we have running. There is no good reason not to give this game a try.
3909	1	a	It's pretty yummy if you ask me.

3925	1	a	This soul sucking game has claimed my life for pratically 1000 hours now so here's my 2 cents.  This game is infectious once you start modding it, you'll discover new ways to obliterate your friends, enemys, vehicles, entire towns etc.  Then you'll start looking for groups, you'll probably start with a milsim group, these are great, but can be demanding and will drain your life essence with their rules, SOP's and formalities. Then there's the casual groups who do whatever, whenever. These are pure chaos and make modern army's look totally restrained in the level of pure destruction they bring to anything and everything.  Finally, once you got settled in the group of your choice, you'll start enjoying the game even more, then you'll forget the taste of food, or the sound of water, or touch of grass, you're naked in the dark, with nothing.  And that is ARMA 3 in a nutshell, an awesome all consuming entity with the power to consume your very soul.   ENJOY :)
3927	1	a	This may be a long review, but I promise it's worth the read if you're thinking about buying Arma 3.  I play this game all the time. And honestly I can say that Arma 3 is probably the most flexible and least repetitive game out there. There are so many different game modes, modded game modes, mods and communities based around this game that you can never get bored of it. There are PvP game modes like King of the Hill, or Gun Game (if you can actually find a Gun Game server RIP). Survival game modes like Overpoch and Exile (Those 2 are mods). Roleplay game modes like Altis life (which is the main reason why most people buy Arma 3).  Installing Mods is easy and fun, if you have modding experience from other games it applies here. Get the files in your game folder and select them in the launcher. Or subscribe to them on the Workshop and they will automatically update. If you don't like that, there are Launchers that you can download to get specific mods, like A3Launcher or A3Sync. Modding opens up whole new ways to play, as there are so many mods that you can combine to create a really fun experience.  You can make your own missions, which is semi-easy with the new Editor. There is something called the 'Virtual Arsenal', where you get an arsenal (Basically where you can get anything in the game. Gun, Uniform, Launcher, Vehicle etc etc) and try out different things. Tutorials can also help you to learn the basics of movement, commanding, different caliber weaponry and flying. Flying is one of the more daunting things for new players, but you get the hang of it pretty early on.  Back to communities, Milsim is quite a big one on Arma 3, as well as Tactical realism groups too. I will try to explain the difference between the two to the best of my knowledge. Milsim is usually stricter, you will have to behave yourself a lot more and stick to specific equipment because you are probably simulating a Unit of any military from real life. Tactical realism however isn't the same as Milsim. In Tactical Realism, you could use any bit of kit you wanted, and different tactics, and it would still be realistic to some extent. So in all, Milsim is better if you want strict, military-like gameplay, and Tactical realism is better if you still want the tactical side, with more flexibility and at a more 'relaxed' pace.  You can play Arma 3 in many different ways depending on your playstyle too, if you like to get close with a full-auto weapon, you could do that. If you like to sit at a distance with a Marksman Rifle, you could do that. And this applies in any game mode, it's even better in a team because each person can have different roles that open up new ways to operate in different situations.  My review probably wasn't as good as some others, but there's too much to talk about. Buy this game, and have the dedication to push past the first few hours, and you won't regret it. I promise.
3929	1	a	tl;dr - Best meme of 2019  &gt;Be me &gt;Join arma 3 Battleroyal game &gt;wait in lobby for 5 min while layers join &gt;run around &gt;find group of 3 sitting in a circle &gt;I shall join while I wait. &gt;Hey!

Just watch the video for the song. Also add me of you want to play arma 3! I mainly play exile and battleroyal, but will play other things!
3931	1	a	Is nais geim, many fun playing many hours yes.
3933	1	a	Kids play COD. Boys play Battlefield. Men play Arma
3935	1	a	Haven't played it that much but it seems pretty good...
3937	1	a	Loud  paul also found this gr8 7/7
3939	1	a	Fun with friends
3941	1	a	Fun for a few hours.
3943	1	a	Ok so I bought the game and played a bit to get the controls under my fingers. Then I descovered the Epoch mod. Then I found out that lots of players are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on Epoch servers. Then I found a PvE Epcoh server. Then I began to understand how people rack up thousands of hours on this game: 1) it's absolutely amazing  2) it has a zombie mod that is a billion times less glitchy than Arma 2 DayZ 3) Trying to go from one city to the next without a vehicle.  Tips for Epoch: Get a DMR or sniper rifle. Regardless if you're PvP or PvE, you'll need a long range rifle and a good scope. If you don't have these, you'll get picked off by the Players and AI that do have them.  Other priority items are... Carryall packs (largest backpack) First aid kits believe it or not; smoke grenades. If you can make a friend on PvP or are assaulting an event with some random person on a PvE server, and they can't see a target that you can, toss a smoke.  I've used it lots of times and it works like a charm  Totally worth buying, 100% replayability 
3945	1	a	Got boring after the 500 hour mark, there's like, nothing to do.
3947	1	a	  this is what i need.............. &lt;3 10/10
3949	1	a	I'm warming up to it..
3951	1	a	Bought this game a week ago for $39.99 Now its on special for $19.99  10/10 would waste money again.
3953	1	a	very low settings : 15 fps ultra settings : 14 fps  100/10 would fps again
3955	1	a	If you can think it arma has it
3957	1	a	Bought Game Join Random Altis Life Server Find Admin Named Zac Zac Gives Me 25k+ Worth Of Gear Knocked Out By Zac's Friend He Steals My Kidney We Find Spainards He Steals THEIR Kidneys We Drive To The Black Market I Get Out To Only Get Knocked Out Again He Steals My Other Kidney I Get Up like Its Nothing Take HIs Kidney And Run Away To Zac Spainards Have Guns He Kills The Spainards  Zac Yells At Him He Walks To Me Knocks Me Out Steals Another Kidney From Me   11/10 - Would Loose 3 Kidneys Again!
3959	1	a	When you play this game you will be in a serious fire fight, Taking orders from your squad leader to provide suppressive fire or something while staying out of fire of an LAV, A friendly transport heli flys over head, it tells your squad leader he needs to get rid of that LAV before the heli can land, So he tells his AT specialist tofire a rocket at that LAV.... Apparently for some reason that LAV explodes and it is sent into the air, It becomes the perfect AA weapon, Instantly taking out the Heli and leaving you to over whelmed by hoards of sharp shooting AI.  10/10
3961	1	a	Good game spent a lot of time playing it.
3963	1	a	Functional, realistic, brutal and dank.What more could you ask for in a game oh yeah boobs.Well just buy The Witcher 3.
3965	1	a	Arma 3 can and will be frustrating to start out with; rest asured it is amazing you just need to do the following:   1. Look up Dslyecxi's guides to Arma 3 - Particularly the movement and shooting guide:    https://youtu.be/G8vrbzNYEwM?list=PLQEd6zRLOafWtrQ4EAYKl6z23hvCLYgW6   This will give you an overview of how awesome movement can be in arma when you understand it.   2. Dont start in the campaign. At least dont get frustrated if you find the campaign hard to start with.   3. Instead I suggest going on a Domination server. Particularly if you find one that has infinite sprint. Most if not all will let you test out weapons and play on a team of other players against AI. You will quickly get a good feel of the teamwork in the game and you can ask players ingame if something isnt working for you. Most importantly if you are stuck far away you can respawn at a base and start again without the tediousness of walking simulator that Arma 3 can be.   4. When you get better branch out and try more hard core version of missions. There is hours and hours of fun here to find. You will eventually love walking simulator 2014 :)
3967	1	a	Amazing game!  Amazing Mods!  Amazing Graphics!  rate this game 10/10!
3969	1	a	Most realistic Military sim out there! The physics engine is crazy as hell and realistic as possible, although it does â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off when u fall 5 feet off a rock and u die.... Bohemia u gotta fix that crap! Overall its amazing and has so many gamemodes and ways to have fun! Did i mention the editor! you can make ur own games or just mess around and place enemys and any vehicle u like to have fun with! great game 10/10
3971	1	a	Got it for Altis life stayed for King of the Hill.
3973	1	a	It's okay i guess
3975	1	a	ITS THE BEST GAME EVER! IT INTRODOUCED ME TO PROGRAMING AND TO THE BEST PEOPLE I COULD EVER MEET I REALLY RECOMMEND IT
3977	1	a	  Takes Some Time To UnderStand How To Play But When You Get It Its The Greatest Game Out There
3979	1	a	great game
3981	1	a	i love this game, it adds a lot of features to the previous one (ARMA 2) and i love playing them both, would recommend anyone to get this if they liked Arma 2
3983	1	a	  I love this game 10/10 great game
3985	1	a	Kids play Cod Teens play BF Russians play CSGO Everyone play Arma 3(except normal people)
3987	1	a	Found the game had a lack of gameplay. Struggled to find things to do.
3989	1	a	as my computer starts to weep i start up arma 3 .... my i5 4670 and R9 390 powerless to help and i realise that 15 fps is indeed playable !!!
3991	1	a	I throughly enjoy this game. I use all the DLC except APEX. In my opinon, this is a fantastic game to play with your 'hardcore' rpg game friends. You can be as tactical as you wish, or be careless and fool around in heli's all day. The controls take a bit to get the hand of (because there is so many) but once you do, you feel as if you are not limited at all as to what your player can do in-game. Most of the time the physics are pretty good, but somtimes they are just hilarious. I would give this game a 8/10 rating, and highly recomend it to any adventureous and thrill seeking gamers.
3993	1	a	I left a house and got shot
3995	1	a	AWSOME! I usualy play DayZ SA and Arma 3 is really diffrent,but in a good way :D The Tactics,Controls,GameModes,...Everything is so nicely optimized,i must say it is much harder to play then DayZ but thru time it will get easier! Good Job , Hope to see More inprovements! 11/10 - ' :D '
3997	1	a	I Like This Game ;)
3999	1	a	Great game, really love it highly recommend buying it 100%
4001	1	a	A1 10/10- a guy with 420 hours on the game B)

4005	1	a	Commence Protocol Apex!  10/10
4007	1	a	get this game! And the Breaking Point mod for it!
4009	1	a	Hmm, where do I begin with this review?  Well, first of all, I am a veteran to this series and I have been playing ArmA for the past 6 years. This is a game that will always keep you interested with the powerful Eden Editor, Zeus, various multiplayer gamemodes and the brilliant singleplayer campaigns.  For the beginners, this is a game that you need to keep on playing to develop your skills, you will not start off as a hero or have the ability to 'run and gun.' This is a military combat simulator sandbox and if you get shot, chances are you will die but if you don't, your abilities will be hindered and become combat ineffective. Best way to learn how to play the game is to go into the editor and make your own little scenario to practise or use one of the many scenarios made by the developers. For multiplayer, there are many different types of gamemodes and missions available across hundreds if not thousands of servers around the globe but if you want a true immersive experience, you would need to join a unit or community that plays with operations, teamwork, coordination and more, including mods to get the best experience.  Mods; man, that's a huge part of the ArmA community. There is a massive community on the BiForums and Steam Workshop dedicated to modifications to enhance your ArmA experience. Some of the big ones like Community Upgrade Project (CUP) has a variety of weapons, vehicles and terrains ported from previous games to ArmA 3. Red Hammer Studios (RHS) has United States Armed Forces (USAF) which includes a large array of US units, weapons, ground vehicles and aircraft. There are so many mods that this game has that I could write a paper to list not even half of them.  The official DLC's for this game are quality content, the Marksman DLC and the Helicopter DLC are a little on the expensive side of things for the amount of content you get but APEX is the best DLC for this game, an entirely new map, lots of new weapons, vehicles, units and more. However I would still suggest you wait until this game and its DLC's go on sale before purchasing it, better 'bang for your buck.'
4011	1	a	Its an awesome game for serious gamers who wants to play a army simulator
4013	1	a	This game is broken in my ways , but good ways.
4015	1	a	I've won 64 player Battle Royale TWICE  What have you done? Loser
4017	1	a	One of the most fun games out in the steam store. There's so much variety that inlcudes mods and different gamemodes. Even though simulator games are not your type you can still find a place in Arma. You can play gamemodes ranging from all of the Life mods (Altis Life, Arma 3 Life, etc), King of the Hill, Domination (coop Players vs. AI), Wasteland, Epoch, Exile, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, and many more. Those are just multiplayers mods and gamemodes you can play, there is also a huge variety of mods and missions available in the workshop that you can download and play nonstop. All of this available in huge maps, such as Altis that is around 260 sq km.  Every day, whatever you play, you will always experience something new. Be it either encountering a Wipeout for the first time, getting Allahu Akbar'd at Kavala Square in Altis Life, robbing a bank, being the most powerful group in a Wasteland server, meeting random people and start chaos around Altis, etc. There are just so many things you can do in Arma, the possibilities might be endless. I really recommend this game for anyone who is looking to have a unique experience. One thing though, playing with other people together in a group or clan is 1000 times more recommendable to get the most out of the experience.   First Experiences in Altis Life: -Spawn in Kavala -No gear, only hello kitty clothes -Walk in the street -Spot a offroad piled with rebels shooting in the air being chased by 10 police cars -Walk into Kavala Square -Find half the server there (around 40 people) -Police don't know how to control the crowd -People jumping off buildings demanding money -Circle of guys smoking week with Bob Marley music -Sudden shout of 'ALLAHU AKBAR' -The whole Kavala Square gets leveled -Everyone dies -Spawn again -Offroad pulls up, guy says to take a gun -Grab gun from the offroad with 5 other people -Do a 10 min stealth mission around Kavala to avoid cops with the 5 guys -Plan out a robbery -PUT YOUR HANDS UP -Turns out to be an officer -Turns around, spam tazes -Restrained -Go to jail for 15 minutes -10/10 would Altis Life again
4019	1	a	Perfect for me and my bushes
4021	1	a	Logs on to King of the Hill server. Gets a truck w/ a gun mounted on back. Drives down to a crossroad. Waits for teammates to drive by. Shoots teammates and kills them. Listens to people raging in chat. Sees around half a dozen RVs driving down the dirt road with a tank behind. Kills everybody but the tank. Tank steamrolls me. 10/10 would 1v1 a tank again.
4023	1	a	love this game.. so realistic
4025	1	a	Have you ever thought 'Man, being in the military sure does look fun, except for the danger, the hard work, and the PTSD'? Well look no further. Billy Mays (rip in piece) here with a new fantastic product. Talking about the ArmA III! Insurgents got you suppressed? Call in close air support, and show those silly Altisians the meaning of freedom. Iranian forces setting up checkpoints all over? Send your rebel minions in, and call in an airstrike! Call now, and get your very own laser designator, complete with the highest level of authorization for drone stikes! Dont wait, call today!
4027	1	a	I was able to write a review for this i don't even own the game 10/10
4029	1	a	Great Quality game with a variety of things you can do and play, the community is very big and there are a lot of mods. Bare in mind that this is a semi simulator in my perspective, not a cod, but overall i love this game and btw dont sell cocaine in arma life ;)
4031	1	a	ItÂ´s Ok!
4033	1	a	great game! i remember when i was a child i will grab sticks that look like guns and grab my friends and act like we are in war and do funny call outs xD but this game really brout my childhood back to life you need to get this game! grab a couple of friends and do some wasteland or king of the hill! or just get one of those sick survival mods and try to survive with friends! its a amazing game 10/10 also there is role playing servers and there is that arma 3 life mod witch is AMAZING! please if you have the money get this game! if you like titical shooters this is the one for you!
4035	1	a	Best Game ever! played it for so long! everybody should have it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4037	1	a	I dont even have the game, but i can write a review.   10/10
4039	1	a	Best of running simulator 2420.
4041	1	a	Shot a guy, his body flew about 20 metres into the air, still managed to live   11/10
4043	1	a	let's go for another 1000! :D
4045	1	a	Buy game for $30. Launch game. Ask friend which gamemode is preferrable. Friend says TDM should be good for starters. Start playing. Get to a capture point. Staying prone, 3 people at the point, they pass by me. Be like wtf, these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s blind and can't see me? Kill all 3. Get kicked for killing team-mates.  mfw.
4047	1	a	Ruined my life during finals week  10/10 would destroy GPA again
4049	1	a	I got to say, I'm just the under 1k hours on this game, and i have to tell u this game is great, many many hours spent having fun, it's tough at the beginning but u get better, only downside to this game is that it is addicting
4051	1	a	(Edited to update pros, cons, and opening statement.) I've put in 279 hours on ArmA III so far. I've played ArmA: Cold War Assault, ArmA 2, ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead, and ArmA III. I am a big fan of this series due to that it is very realistic and the possibilities are nearly endless thanks to the Steam Workshop integration. ArmA III takes ArmA II and improves it plus more. ArmA III is more smooth and less clunky compared to ArmA II. ArmA III is a lot better then ArmA II because whereas you had to go to 3rd party websites to get mods for ArmA II, ArmA III has Steam Workshop to get most of your add-ons. The integration of Steam Workshop is the icing on the cake for this game because the integration is so tight knit into the ArmA III launcher. A new addition to the ArmA series is a launcher, ArmA III has a launcher that starts up before you play the game and it allows you to choose which mods you want active while playing or if you want to play stock ArmA III. This launcher also adds in 'Presets', you can use these presets for servers if you are on a RP server which has special mods you can check the servers mods, and add them to a preset. The combat in ArmA III is more refined and smooth compared to ArmA II. ArmA III brings a stamina system which affects your weapon accuracy after sprinting for long periods of times (this can be disabled on servers). You can also crouch run now! This has been asked for since ArmA II and they brought it in ArmA III. Another new feature they added is the ability to run while swapping weapons. There are also 9 different stances that allows you to be more flexible in a firefight and rewards anyone that uses them correctly. Here is a pros and cons list for this game!  Pros: - More refined and robust combat system - More refined and robust movement system - Adds in more realism - A vast variety of weapons - Weapon attachments such as Suppressors, Sights, Bi-pods, Flashlights/Lasers. - New stamina system - Constantly receiving updates from Bohemia Interactive - New DLC's and Map's being added - Steam Workshop Integration - Flexible and useful launcher - Amazing servers - New 3D Editor which came in Eden update - Better resource management with it better balancing out your GPU usage and CPU usage which came in the Eden update - More Refined Textures which came in the Eden update - A tad bit more optimized then previously which came in the Eden update - Constant improvements to UI, Preformance, Lighting, and Textures  Neutral: - Steam Trading Cards (for anyone that is interested in them, that's why it's under 'Neutral'.) -Frame rate can be a problem due to optimization (not Bohemia's fault, they can't optimize a game with such freedom for mods, and a open editor.)  Cons: - FPS Drops upon entering highly populated areas - Combat can be hectic at times if you do not understand compass bearings and map coordinates - Very steep learning curve - Desync is still a very big problem but that's more server-side - No FoV (Field of View) option, the default FoV can make you feel a bit claustrophobic. There is a tool that you can get to fix this, you can get it here  http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=21179 .  It's hard to find cons for this game but those are the only ones I can think of. My rating of this game is a 8.5/10 it takes ArmA II's problems and improves upon them to make one amazing military simulator.
4053	1	a	I don't own this game, but it's letting me write a review so I've researched the game and here's what I think:  You want realism? Play this game. There are a lot of poses you can get into, accurate star maps, accurate shooting physics, and way more. Overall a great game if you like realism.
4055	1	a	Positives -  Good Semi-Realistic Military Shooter Good varity on weapons/Vehicles Semi Decent Campaign Awsome Editor Good Visauls Good Sounds Negitives -  AI that keep be coded by a 4 year old And wonky animations here and there
4057	1	a	best milirtary game ever
4059	1	a	If you like randomly exploding vehicles this is a game for you
4061	1	a	Honestly hands down the best realistic FPS ever. The authenticity just by itself is worth the price. But the multiplayer is phenomenal and very tactical and fun. Highly recommend this game, but there is one thing. THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE OPTIMIZED! I have GTX titan and I still get from anywhere 20~65 fps which is unacceptable, like really 20 f**king fps? But other than that super fun.
4063	1	a	First 5 minutes of online multiplayer I was killed by stairs. Chased by a drone on epoch and forgot about fall damage and died by jumping off a 2 story house.
4065	1	a	Love this game. So many different things you are able to choose from. if you havent tried it, you are sadly missing out!
4067	1	a	I don't know how to close this game Â°_Â°
4069	1	a	Bought this game last year for $60. I have played for arround 750hours. 60 divided by 750 = 0.08 $0.08 per hour of gameplay... BEST MONEY I HAVE EVER SPENT!
4071	1	a	Great game especially when you find a good server with a good community, plus the mods are awesome!
4073	1	a	As a FPS fanboy i have played FPS games for many years mainly these last years bf3 and bf4 my favourites. Compared to Battlefield, Arma 3 is insanely more realistic and is basicly the closest you can get to a miltary simulator. I have had alot of fun playing this game with friends. Then again it can get too realistic for an avrage FPS gamer like me. 7/10
4075	1	a	Most played game EVER
4077	1	a	Awesome shooter game
4079	1	a	Promised cinamatic moments never recieved.
4081	1	a	Good game would buy again.... 10/10 ign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like chicken butts
4083	1	a	its good
4085	1	a	Despite my few hours, I do believe I am an american soldier
4087	1	a	It is a game for 3 year olds and up
4089	1	a	I Highly recomend this game to anyone and everyone it is a superb multiplayer and the life servers are funny as F***
4091	1	a	best military game ever
4093	1	a	Its alright
4095	1	a	been playing the game for a little bit, its ok
4097	1	a	This is great game, and I really recommend this game for military lovers. But if you have enough money, it would be better to buy Apex too!!! But still, this is my best game.
4099	1	a	15-60fps on lowest graphics with a GTX 780. Still worth buying.  Edit: It lags mostly in cities and what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the jungle map runs better than the sandy one!
4101	1	a	the game is the best game i ever played. just keep on going!
4103	1	a	after they released apex the game has become so buggy and unoptimized its not even funny
4105	1	a	is game is fun and good to do team work with the people around you I honestly think this game is very fun and very stressful to being against other players. But this game is always encouraging other players and makes everyone do teamwork. Causing the situation to be fun and more active .+1
4107	1	a	This game is THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
4109	1	a	In all honesty, Arma is extremely fun with a group of people even if it's just with one person.  The franchise is a heavy military simulation, so if you're coming off from Counter Strike or Call of Duty, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  Teamwork and communication is key to this game. It's got a great community of people, an abundance of groups you can join and play with, and an abundance of player made missions. The Vanilla game is pretty dull, but it's got a TON of mods you can download to enhance your experience. Mods that make the game more immersive and realistic than most games of this genre. Either play with a group of friends or find yourself a community to play with. My personal favorites are BROMA and Murshun. If you're looking to purchase this, I extremely recommend waiting for a sale. If you can get the Apex and the Base game for a good price, DO IT! 
4111	1	a	It is hard to make a review of this game. Realistically, every single person is going to have a unique experience and it will vary. The one thing that I can say is that performance and physics wise it is much better than any of the previous armas; however, I think that it lacks the content arma 2 had. If you have time and patience you can mod the hell out of this game to make it into what arma 2 used to be. If not, well, youre gonna be stuck with futuristic looking vehicles, guns, and awkward looking CSAT uniforms. If you dont mind the futuristic style content than it should be fine. I personally loved arma for the cold war - modern era equipment and the asthetic realism of it all which this game failed to deliver until modded. Regardless of that I still absolutely love this game and going to continue playing it for as long (at least) as it takes Gaben to release HL3
4113	1	a	So lets get this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ started, i met a prick called scotttt (jk luv im relly &lt;3), i was playing altis life RP when all of a sudden i come across a new spawn and pick him up on the back of my quad bike. We proceed to drive around the main city doing mad sick tricks fam, then my friends suggest we kidnap him so naturally i went along with this. We tie him up, phisically abuse him and steal his kidneys (i ate them ;)) Once we had taken said kidneys he turned around and asked for a lift we said yes took him to the hospital and got him healed up. Somehow he decided to ask to join our gang,we said yes and now we are friends (somehow)   Great game   10/10  Would recomend to a friend                                                                   ;)
4115	1	a	This is a great war simulator which suports realisim with real time 1st or 3rd person stratagy. go it alone our with a squad of AI's or players and i general great game
4117	1	a	Very nice graphic thruu , Play mutiplayer Server = BEST / KOTH / Altis life
4119	1	a	Very nice game, Realistic. Downloaded it after a few months, Laptop hant handle it anymore probably due to the updates, sucks alot but the game was awesome for me!
4121	1	a	If you're looking for a military simulator then Arma 3 is your best bet. Realistic gameplay. Great graphics and sound effects. Lots of gameplay modes available. Would definitely recommend!
4123	1	a	Best military simulation!
4125	1	a	This is my Go to, This Game is amazing alone but combine with ACE, TFR and Friends nothing can go wrong... Not. In the end i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a serious MilSim enviroment, tons of fun awaits anyone in this game.
4127	1	a	I'll go ahead and say that I've played this since the Alpha stage of the game and I have to say that ArmA III has come a long way since then.  ArmA III is a great way for you to explore a more detailed tactical shooter. This is more than shooter with pretty maps and sights. This is more than just a 'Shoot 'em up and knock 'em down' kind of game. This IS a simulation, a simulation of what armed combat can look like in reality, unlike the movies and shows. YOU are down there, boots on the ground, standing shoulder to shoulder with your squadmates and fighting to either seize a town or fighting for your life when you're the only one left. The sounds are down right amazing and the detail on the rifles are wonderful.  When you are with friends and fighting alongside others, communication is KEY to succeeding and achieving victory! Communicate with the people driving the tanks or any armored vehicle and combine arms to tackle enemy armor and air units, as well as communicating with the ones flying attack helos and jets. Combine all of those elements and you've got yourself an unforgetable experience of awesomeness. And all of this gets better if you find yourself a Mil-Sim unit!  You can specailize yourself in any MOS (Military Ocupational Specialty). From Rifleman to AT Specialist, helicopter and/or fighter pilot, you can learn all of this in this game!  Of course threre are mods which alters the realism of this game to a more hardcore level which I highly recommend you doing.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you are looking for a detailed Mil-Sim tactical shooter, then ArmA III is for you, remember, communication is the KEY to success!  Good luck, fellow virtual soldier!
4129	1	a	So much stuff to do, RP/Battle Royale and what not. Excellent game and supported still by the developers at Bohemia!
4131	1	a	A game that I've returned to countless times. Always amazed by how it surprises me
4133	1	a	-I have to go to base tomorrow, but wait, game night's not over yet. One more game...  So far it's pretty much the best milsim out there, bar none. I do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber.  Negatives are the extreme amount of Wasteland servers out there, and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends.  For better or worse, unless you, for some inexplicable reason, actually LIKE the Wasteland mod, you're better off playing the co-op servers where it's you, 20 or so other folks, customizable loadout ammo crates, and places on the map to clear of enemy AI. Game looks good, and it's a real treat for such a milsim to look good, and have alot of potential draw distance.
4135	1	a	A piece of unoptimized â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The game that has a bunch of dlc despite it being unfinished but it is still a very fun game to play.
4137	1	a	1131 Hours in a Video Game!? Seriously!? Where's me Official Urban City Map!?  Well...until then...guess another 1131 Hours to go!
4139	1	a	Best military simulation ever.. Can't beat this game
4141	1	a	Shut up and buy this awsome game already
4143	1	a	This game is so realistic i sometimes think im actually about to die!
4145	1	a	This Is The Best Milsim game you will find it has a wonderfull comunity And everysingle gamemode  you dream off wil be there you have everything from Roleplay To fighting zombie's Came for The war XP Then why not join An Milsim unit , This Game is an Must have
4147	1	a	Fun game. Really it is. I'm serious.
4149	1	a	This game is time consuming and addidctive I highly recommend this game.
4151	1	a	This game will make you more concentrated and patient. you will love it as i do.
4153	1	a	It's pretty good.  Ladders are still death traps.
4155	1	a	Hit a rock in a hunter, fly 5Km away.  10/10 Best Game Out There
4157	1	a	I developed PTSD
4159	1	a	Its real and reaily Project Reality in high graphic quailty.
4161	1	a	Why doesn't anyone want to play? Optimized and running smooth, best military simulation.  Update: Since release this game has slowly degraded into a low performing, buggy, storage hogging, memory leaking game. Unfortunately I still recommend this game because there is contention in wanting a well performing, immersive, and massive open world shooter. The survival mods of this game are what keeps it going.
4163	1	a	just as you think you cant blow anything else up, you suddenly realise, that there is another town to blow up as well
4165	1	a	addicting for the next 500+ hours or so then it becomes boring as you will be doing the same thing again but 500+ hours of entertainment :D
4167	1	a	Best mil-sim game ever, especially with 22GB's of mods.
4169	1	a	Amazing game - not worth $60, 3 years after release - let alone the rediculous â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing DLC prices and business practices. The game is still horribly optimized - and has been since the beta, so I call â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t on the System Requirements - of which I surpass by a long shot; But the game struggles to maintain a steady framerate above 30 on a Quad Core Skylake Processor in multiplayer. What annoys me more are the bugs that have been unaddressed since beta, but the Devs are too busy 'reanimating the idle stance' and adding new gun sounds.  That's not to say that the game itself isn't great - This is really the closest you can get to the real thing - and if you get on a realism based server, you'll be sitting bored as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for hours, then have an action and adrenaline packed 5 minute firefight, just like the real deal.  We don't jump from Jets going 400 knots, snipe an enemy chopper pilot and his gunner, then strap C4 to said Jet, hop back in mid-air and fly it into a tank like the Battlefield 4 kiddies would like you to believe. This is as close as you can get without really experiencing the suck. There are also tons, and tons of mods to choose from that further enhance the experience as well as A3 Exile or DayZ Epoch. The flying and vehicle combat is extremely satisfying as well. I would say get this in a sale - or on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the DLC is more reasonably priced on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as well. There are a lot of games out there that I would say are better deals for less money than this game. But if you're willing to shell out the money, and have a beast computer, then by all means go for it. (Steam censors â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for some reason, greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers.)
4171	1	a	Here's the thing about ARMA: it is what you and the people you play with make it. Nothing more and nothing less. This has always been the case with the ARMA series.   The vanilla game with no mods is decent if you have a group of friends to play it with, boring if you don't. The mod community is enormous and most people play versions that are modded in some way. This ranges from relatively small quality-of-life changes like ACE to total conversions like Exile and Epoch. The game can be an ultra hardcore milsim or a somewhat more arcadey (but still with a lot of realistic elements) shooter. The game can be hilariously buggy at times. 90% of your playtime, it will be stable, and a lot the bugs are caused by mods, but you will encounter them even in vanilla.  In multiplayer, this game is VERY INTENSIVE ON SERVER HARDWARE. It takes a beast of a server with a beast of a connection to host 50+ people with no lag. A lot of server owners don't set their population limits appropriately and you end up with laggy servers when they get full. You might have to look around for a server that's set up properly for the number of people allowed on it. You won't have to look terribly far, though, and once you find some good servers, the multiplayer is great.  I'll mainly address the quality of simulation, since that's what ARMA is primarily intended to be. Mods are very much personal-preference based and outside the control of the developer so it wouldn't be fair to go on about them too much.  World Simulation: Very good. The engine includes a host of robust options for simulating weather, and the weather affects the world and your ability to fight in it in predictable, realistic ways. Fog creeps up from valleys in the morning like you would expect it to, for example. The simulation does fall short, however, when you consider how the weather affects the ground; there's no struggling through mud after a heavy rain, but that is something that no modern engine of which I am aware can currently achieve.  Infantry Simulation: Excellent. Ballistics are calculated appropriately, first-focal-plane reticles graduated in milliradians can be used to estimate range and hold-over properly. Terminal projectile performance when penetrating barriers, body armor, and previously living tissue can occasionally be a bit off, but mostly functions as one might expect in reality. Glancing or multiple ricochets can be downright wonky but don't have a huge effect on the game since most of their energy is spent on the bounce. Occasionally a bullet will hit a helmet at just the right angle to glance off instead of deliver what would have been a headshot, which can be realistic or not depending on the exact circumstances. Infantry is the most realistically simulated part of the game and has clearly had the most time spent on it.  Air Vehicle Simulation: Good. Be warned, all flight models are simplified. If you're into flying, it's not going to be as close to reality as DCS or Flight Sim X are, but those are dedicated flight sims. Fixed-wing aircraft work just fine. CAS has to coordinate with infantry on the ground to be effective. Air superiority can be a little underwhelming. As a pilot, most of your time will likely be spent in rotary-wing aircraft, either as air support or as a transport pilot. Rotary wing flight models are very simplified and don't factor the finer aspects of rotary-wing aviation such as ground effect and translational lift, and they barely acknowledge rotor torque, but they are otherwise passable. The big challenge for aviation in ARMA comes from knowing how to use your aircraft appropriately and make tactical decisions with your approaches, rather than the actual act of flying.  Ground Vehicle Simulation: Passable. Ground vehicles function just fine, if not in a completely realistic manner. The main issue is that they can take damage from very strange sources when you wreck them into something. For example, crashing an ATV into the wrong type of bush at relatively low speed can cripple the vehicle and nearly kill you, but encountering a small construction fence at the same speed can simply knock the fence over while you continue on your way. As long as you aren't wrecking, the vehicles otherwise behave in fairly predictable ways in terms of encountering small-arms fire, mines, IEDs, and larger ordnance.  Sea Vehicle/Diving Simulation: Passable. Honestly, there's not much reason to go in the water on the current maps in ARMA, but it includes a lot of options for interacting with the water such as submarines, boats, wetsuits, and chest-mounted rebreathers like the ones used by Navy SEALS. The depth of simulation kind of ends there, with no provision for breathing gas mixes or operating depth considerations on the rebreather, which is stated to be a pure-oxygen variant and as such would be fatal at depths of 20 feet and below. On Altis and Stratis, the world below sea-level is well finished, there's just sadly not much reason to go there. Underwater controls can be a little awkward but usable.  AI Simulation: Borderline to poor. The AI are fairly dumb regardless of difficulty setting. Difficulty is increased by allowing the AI to cheat more and more. The end result is that the most 'difficult' AI will do things like spot you through a building with xray and aimbot you through the wall. If I had to choose one aspect that Bohemia really needs to work on for future installments, the AI is it.  In conclusion, I recommend ARMA 3 if you have some buddies to play it with or are willing to find some. It's a solid milsim, or a pretty solid whatever-you-want-to-make-it-through-mods. The game depends very much on interaction with others, however, and the odds are if you get it for a single-player experience, you won't enjoy it too much.  UPDATE:  Post-Apex, ARMA 3 remains very much what you make it. The mod community is huge and varied, tons of servers are available for vanilla and modded games, and the base game is still great at its core. The occasional bug still rears its ugly head, but there are far fewer of them than there were even a year ago, and they tend to not be as potentially gamebreaking.
4173	1	a	Just pure awesomeness for everyone.
4175	1	a	Fantastic game, if you love games like battlefield4 and fallout4 this is your dream game come true. I play mostly the Exile mod and its a great time with mates hunting down other people.
4177	1	a	doing it for da xp
4179	1	a	This game made me realize that I can play something at 15 fps and love it.  EDIT: Upgraded PC, now I get a smooth 60 fps and love it even more
4181	1	a	I've Played this game since December 2013, and if i look back and see how the game was at that time and how it's now i feel like the game has improved so much! But it's still some things that needs fixing. If you are into Military Simulation, PVP, Roleplay etc. this game is for you! But Arma III is a game where you can make everything possible! For Example Aftermath Rush - Battlefield in Arma III, And as i've said i have played this from December 2013 and i DO NOT regret buying arma at all! I've gotten so much out of this game and YES this game is worth the price and MORE!
4183	1	a	money well spent
4185	1	a	2300 hours in Arma III, speaks for itself. IF you looking for realistic bullet and weapons behavior, Arma its the best choice. But Arma III Vanilla will not keep you for long, its the mods that keep this game alive so look for good ones like Breaking Point, Tactical Battlefield. Game is great but has a lot of annoying bugs that are in game not fixed for years like ladders, stairs and bulletproofbushes. Still the best game i ever played...
4187	1	a	10/10 Game hit a tree going 1 km/h and went off to space
4189	1	a	Amazing game, You all need to pick this up if you like beautiful graphics and realistic combat. Harsh for any new player to master but when you get the the feel of the game and master the controls it's great fun, gets your heart pumping and adrenaline kickin.
4191	1	a	Since some of the people who read my comment didn't understand I was talking about multiplayer and not the game itself, I guess I'll go back and edit my review.  The singleplayer is awesome, that's all I can really say. Just finished it today. There are some hard parts, I died quite a bit. I really like the fact that you get to lead your own squad and posistion them wherever you want, I like games like that. However, the multiplayer server thing is still not good for me. I've tried to refrain from playing it, but one day I thought I'd give it a shot. So I was driving a tank, and we were ambushed by 2 mraps full of at soldiers. I destroyed the first mrap and I ended up getting shot by an AT soldier. The guys who were in the convoy with me ended up killing the rest and said I was terrible. I saved their asses, but no. I was the bad one in the situation. I will say, there are some really cool moments in the game, including multiplayer, which is why I will reccomend the came. Down below is my original review.      This game is fun, but once again, the community seems like a bunch of jerk wads. I got in a helicopter and decided to try and fly and I accidentally crash and then they're sitting there calling me names and stuff, then I say I'm new and they're like, 'Then don't play the game!' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the community, I'm done with this game. I was so hyped to play it, but sadly, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community strikes again.
4193	1	a	If you liked getting 30 frames in Arma 2, you'll LOVE getting 20 frames in Arma 3!
4195	1	a	Nice game. If you know how to play it.
4197	1	a	Pretty fun game if you are looking for a pretty true to life simulator
4199	1	a	First of all, This game is amazing!  The graphics; fantastic. The amount of 'stuff' to do; outstanding. The ability to run well on low end PC's; Ehh... Anyways, this is Arma 3. It is a military shooter, which captured the realism of anything from Infantry Firefights to Drone warfare, and CAS runs.   Pros:  -Looks amazing on high graphics  -Amount of 'Stuff' to do; amazing  -Modibility; 11/10 there are some amazing mods!! -Community is Fairly decent -A lot of effort put into this game as far as mechanics. -Endless fun with friends -All of the controls!!  Cons: -All of the Controls!!  -!!!MAJOR LEARNING CURVE!!!! (as far as how to drive, fly, shoot, range targets, list goes on!) -CPU and MRAM are a Major key to how well this game plays.  (Basically, the CPU, AND MRAM are what make this game playable. With a good i7, and 32 gigs of Ram, I was able to get 60 fps on Ultra settings with low terrain, and minimal post processing effects at 1080p [When I did not have GPU Yet; I now have a 980ti, and it still can be a bit buggy] But if you want good terrain, FXAA, Post processing, HDR, Bloom, All that good stuff, you must have a vary good GPU!!!!)  -Somewhat poorly optimized on multiplayer servers mainly. Singleplayer, peice of cake!  -Must have good Computer!!!! -Very Time consuming. Like...... A lot.... I have 1,000 hours, and Idk how.  -DLC Watermarks &gt;:(  Anyways, if you are even remotely considering of buying this game, DO IT!! If you do, GET THE APEX DLC!!!! It is the best DLC out of all of them, but the map it adds is difficult to run, even for me. (980ti) but looks amazing!!! Hope this helped you out a bit. This is my opinion on the game...... Its good! 
4201	1	a	I really like the Arma 3 Game, lots of Excitement and Enjoyment.
4203	1	a	I love it. End. Have some hours
4205	1	a	Only if you have a strong cpu xd
4207	1	a	Nominated for the test of time award. Great game honestly.
4209	1	a	Arma 3 is The perfect game if you're looking for a military simulation.  -Good Points: There is a lot of multiplayer server. Some server can host until 200 people. The Eden Editor allows you to create your own misssion and to publish it in the Steam Workshop. You have a lot of military and civilian vehicle/weapon/stuff. The graphics are pretty good. There is tons of mods and content.  -Bad Points: Not very optimised. The AI could be better. Sadly you can find bug/glitches.
4211	1	a	Very good war simulator. Excelent graphics 60fps w/ 3GB graphic card (high to medium settings). Great multiplayer.
4213	1	a	The best game in the world
4215	1	a	I rate this game a 10/10 for their being no twelve's YAY!!! Plus all the awesome things you can do in this game.
4217	1	a	Some kind of a middle-ground between Microsoft Flight Sim and Call of Duty, Arma 3 aims for realistic military strategy and deployment. Unlike a standard first-person shooter this doesn't manifest as a 'gritty' and 'hard boiled' experience, more rather it can bring to your attention just how hum-drum and by-the-numbers modern warfare can be waged.   Arma goes for such a hands-on touch that means in order to be effective in practically any deployment you must first familiarize yourself with the standards of calibrating your weapons for the specific range of the enemy you are engaging, and many encounters can be as simple as spotting an enemy combatant and relaying their bearing and distance from your position to an artilleryman.  To many this can be boring, but there is a rare value in such authenticity. That being said the scope of the base game is best left behind in favor of a modded gametype, and indeed the vast majority of working servers do require many mods to play. It can take a fair amount of time to properly set-up and play a modded game of Arma, but it should be known that Arma is workshop compatible and contains incredibly easy-to-use modding tools in it's own launcher.  Between finding players, setting up mods and generally familiarizing yourself with the game, it can take very long to get started, but thankfully the result is fantastic and completely unique, if a little buggy.
4219	1	a	Best game I have played so far.  Wanting Tactial Combat? BOOM AI missions and set-up war servers.  Wanting RP? BOOM Altis Life or Life mod. (Mod is more sophisticated RP)  Wanting straight-up PVP? BOOM Exile, Epoch, Sector control, the options are limitless.  Wanting to just mess around with friends? BOOM AI Missions.    Generally an amazing game.   Addictive though, be careful.
4221	1	a	Awesome game! just awesome is all i have to say about this game
190	0	a	This game isnt really worth buying unless you plan to mod it to play community content.  ( Mods, Not workshop ) If You compare this to other games bohemia has made it is a Pitiful comparison and tho this game does infact have all content from Arma 2 It is not done so by bohemia themselves. It does require moding to be able to access this games full potential. This might be seen as easy by most people. some might even think this is a good thing But i do not think this game is the way it should be.      TLDR Butt Mad because no content
4223	1	a	i ove this game its so realistic
4225	1	a	Beautiful. Still the best game.
4227	1	a	The actual game itself isn't over the top bad. Sure, the animations aren't exactly top notch, and there are some bugs and hiccups. But a huge open world, massive multiplayer servers with hundreds of players, tanks, planes, and explosions certainly make up for its downsides. Its something I could sit down and play for hours...    Just make sure to stay the hell away from Altis Life Roleplay. 13 year old police and constant mugging of my $2 apples killed 4,239,321 of my brain cells in 20 minutes. Please, retain your IQ points, don't play altis life roleplay.
4229	1	a	Amazing graphics, gameplay and modability 9.5/10
4231	1	a	I love this game. I have spent more time playing this game than I can imagine and I think it will be the reason I upgrade my PC - to make use of the great graphics available.  The ability to mod the game is awesome and I've enjoyed using the editor as much as the game itself. Great stuff.  The aApex DLC appears good, but i am not overwhelmed by it.
4233	1	a	Really fun and cool so buy it with all $90 that its worth
4235	1	a	so much to do so much fun until you have to run alot then it sucks lol jk actually not jk i dont like running
4237	1	a	This Game keeps me playing till the end of days.
4239	1	a	Amazing in every way
4241	1	a	Played it multiple times and every time it is different.  This is one of the best games i ever played and will play again.
4243	1	a	Military Simulation. Great game and mod-able to ensure its long lasting life. Best series i've ever played.  *update*  Joined on EU server. Spawned as Recon Paramedic. Got some objective to take a town. Bought some explosive because recon. Secondary objective is to blow up a radio tower surrounded with mines. Engineer goes first. Got some mines deactivated, planted a c4 and a satchel charge. Engineer got shot. A machine gunner tries to get the engineer out of the mine field. Detonated a mine. A rifle man tries the same thing. History repeats. 18 other tries. *no joke* History repeats. I, as a medic, heroically patched up 2 guys in the middle of the mine field while getting shot at #idiot. Planted the explosive on the tower. Tries to patch the engineer back up which he's on the other side of the tower. Some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ following me stepped on a mine. Goes down. Some random epic man runs across the minefield detonating half of the mine. Dieded. Whole server laugh. Got patched up. Cant detonate the satchel i was planted. Whole team of 15 people including a helicopter and a tank fired at and thrown grenades including smoke grenade for some reason to the radio tower. Radio tower dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Some guy said it was a beginning of a bad joke. Unexpected CAS at radio tower. *because some dude thrown red smoke* 5 people got killed. The pilot laugh. 23 lives were lost to a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mine field and 5 to a friendly CAS. The admins laugh their â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and one of them said 'i am done, i am gonna play mahjong while crying instead of this' - actual quote and proceed to log off.  gg minefield simulator. most effective minefield in the history of arma. 11/10 would make a whole server laugh again.  Bohemia Interactive finally, FINALLY adds in support for 64 bit processing. AWW YISS
4245	1	a	It's cool beans
4247	1	a	If you have a good computer and friends get this game........do it...........now!
4249	1	a	This game has so many servers and mods how can anyone hate it. I bought all the DLC as well. Everyone should give this a try. If you think I am going to type out a full review... well no one man. It would be so long it would be like wrighting book. So many vechiles, so many weapons, so many pieces of gear. So much stuff! It should get the â€œWHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!â€ AWARD.
4251	1	a	Lots of hiding in one place as a tank circles you. 10/10 would sit in a room for 30min again 
4253	1	a	This game is only good if your name isnt Lewis
4255	1	a	yknow, good devs, good community (find yourself a milsim one), infite replayability.
4257	1	a	The bestest shoot your friends simulator ever.
4259	1	a	Greatest of All Time.
4261	1	a	Arma 3 is not a bad game. its fun in groups but also not to bad alone. It can be pretty heavy on payers with weak internet connection. you will die a million times and not know where the hell the shot came from but once you get into the swing of the game and how it runs. it becomes very enjoyable. PS watch out for jets they just seem to destory everyone
4263	1	a	Arma 3 is a very fun game overall, and it managed to keep such a mature community of 'navy seals irl' because the mechanics are pretty complex. I got this game a LONG time ago (pre ordered) and at that time I was 14 (lmao). I had no clue what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a 'grid' was. Now, I still dont know what a grid is. In all seriousness though, it's a very fun game with a amazing community. Hop on a exile, altis life, or king of the hill server to get the full amount, though.
4265	1	a	if this were a coloring book it would be an alright coloring book.
4267	1	a	great game besides driving a car. jesus.
4269	1	a	worth it
4271	1	a	This game has me feeling mixed emotions. You jump in to the singleplayer and find the game to be very tactical and have a lot, and I mean A LOT, of controls. Then you get into combat and see that it's not as forgiving as other games. The challenge does make for some entertainment though. After you may want to check out multiplayer. You'll find that there is TONS of servers. Most of them playing mods like Altis life and Wasteland. These are indeed fun. As soon as you jump in you'll see tons of problems. None of which I've seen in singleplayer. The cars will be flying, animations crap up, and horrific frame rate drops. After all of this, I had a lot of fun. I did have friends to play this though. I would recommend this game, BUT it may not be as enjoyable without friends as with them. 8/10. All criticisms aside, it's still a game that is worth your money.
4273	1	a	Arma 3 is another great game from Bohemia Interactive! The sequel to Arma 2, Bohemia has done a great job improving their flagship military simulator for 2013-2014. 40+ guns, vehicles and 2 more massive maps. Arma has doen a great job in the past combining military simulator with massive maps and games, and it all just comes together in arma 3. Buy this game, its worth it!
4275	1	a	A fantastic game! It's still in his alpha but it's completely fantastic. It's worth those 25 bucks you pay for it.
4277	1	a	GRAPHICS! IF YOU GOT THE SPECS, BUY IT!
4279	1	a	Oh yes ArmA 3, one of my favorite games on steam! I dont have almost 300 hours on it for nothing. This is a military simulation game that is set around 2025. But they did not over do it and set it in the future where theres space ships and all that. Even know it does not feel like the ArmA 2, in the way that it is not feeling like it is a true military game, with all the tactics that arma 2 had. But other than that one problem that I have. (Lack of content to) It turned out to be a very fun game that me and my friends love to play. So much to do as in multiplayer, steam workshop with so much into it, you can even get creative with it like my hunger games mission! All in all very fun!
4281	1	a	Really good game physics are preatty sick too major upgrade from arma 2 . Needs a few more weapons and vehicles maybe a bluefor transport APC. Need to fix the constant lag spikes when people are using custom weapons drove me insane in arma 2 and this one aswell but over all, good game.
4283	1	a	getitgetitgetit  Great multi-player game! Great modding community!
4285	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4287	1	a	I can look around with my head.
4289	1	a	Very good simulation game.
4291	1	a	GET IT!
4293	1	a	Singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. Game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. Prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. Great roguelikelike.
4295	1	a	I reccomend only if you have a computer that can handle it. Also the controlls arnt easy.
4297	1	a	One of the best game sive played this year, would definetly recommend if you dont mind the occasional bugged death.
4299	1	a	Arma is how my hubby convinced me to join the PC gaming community. Couldn't say enough good about it! Can't wait to see how it evolves over the next few years. :)
4301	1	a	Great war simulation game ! I recommend it to all people who loves real action combat, but you might need a decent config for it.
4303	1	a	It is just awesome
4305	1	a	This game is pretty well done, I would say this is in the top 20 games on steam it isnt fun as Arma 2 but it definitely improves the way the game runs, and the voice acting. There are also tons of missions to download of the workshop. I would have so say sniping in this game is my favorite. I would rate this game a 7/10 on the game scale.
4307	1	a	Just Epic, all i need to say. 10/10
4309	1	a	A very fun game. Mods make it alot better.
4311	1	a	This game is amazing! If you've played Arma 2 then you know what Arma is all about. If you havent then let me enlighten you. The Arma series is a 3rd and 1st person combat simulator with unlimited game modes such as Breakingpoint, Dayz, Altis Life, and normal seize and secure objective missions. Jump in with millions of players and experience realism like never before. And for all the fans of Call of Duty and the Battlefield Franchise your in luck because this game has campain for you to enjoy with no 360 no scope â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Strategize, Compromise, and Defeat your enemies one by one in this tactically realistic military simulator. Worth every penny!
4313	1	a	Severely underated game. Even with it's growing popularity, it's still overlooked by many many people. Trying to get my friends to play it is a chore, probably because they're too pansy to make any effort to get through the learning curve.
4315	1	a	One of the best FPS games I have ever played!
4317	1	a	recommended, awnsome game!!!
4319	1	a	i love this game#robin
4321	1	a	Probably the most in-depth shooter game so far...
4323	1	a	this is very amazing game! , you guys should buy it !!!
4325	1	a	If you like realistic war games, this has to be yours!!
4327	1	a	Id â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on this game any day of the week m8. almost onpar with victoria bitter so that's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' sayin something m8.  m8 play it and if you don't like it you are a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in gypsy.
4329	1	a	You are kidding me right?   You are selling the completed version of the game that should have been released in the first place for $20 more have you idiots fallen out of your tree? It was my understanding that you sold the other version because you couldn't finish the single player campaign in time for your release date.  Things you need to address you need to work on your multiplayer experience we your customers love and support you guys cause you have a great lineage but don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ down our backs and tell us it's raining!!!  Please, move from the same gamespy technology that you have been using for over 20-years old and get something more updated also spend a little money on the community by getting us some local servers that WE YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN USE here in the states without a damn 100 plus ping!!!   Get your in game comm's together to optimize bandwidth. The sounds in ArmA 3 are still a little campy I know you don't want to have to pay for a sound engineer to actually do some sound mapping from real guns but guess what this is a real gun sort of experience so suck it up and get it done!  We are your customer not some blind village idoit you can simply pick pocket when you want more money so don't treat us like one!   Regards, Tat
4331	1	a	Get it and Play it enjoy it. It is alpha and it will have annoying bug or something weird.
4333	1	a	Amazing game. Truely unique and majorly realistic. 10 leagues above Battlefield and about 500million leagues above any call of duty game. If a challenge is what you're looking for then the campaign on this game is such a challenge. Even leading your own squad can be a challenege. Almost everything is driveable. Good array of weaponary. And if you play online, it only gets better with Altis life and Breakingpoint. Even Milsim. I recommend you buy this game and support the developers who actually make great games unlike the developers at Activision and Infinity Ward who churn the same garbage out each year.
4335	1	a	Outstanding 10/10 for great action and simulation! this sandbox brings more than creativity!
4337	1	a	A great game for military enthusiasts, those looking for a run and gun experience similar to COD or Battlefield should look elsewhere though. Its tough and unforgiving at first, but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle. The game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios. The world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh. Theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens, but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient, realistic and tactical experience of warefare.
4339	1	a	Love it, engine isnt great...still? but none the less a brill experience
4341	1	a	Bought it a few days ago, Now I have 136 hours of play time. If you value friendships your going to need to not to they will dwindle if you get into this game which it is very easy to as there is ALOT of content.
4343	1	a	ArmA II with physics. Finally.
4345	1	a	Bugs, Hackers, glitches, Unfinnished patches, Unreleased vehicles, Just right there would be enough to steer away anyone from purchasing this game. However, even with all that I still will play Arma III. The online multiplayer experiences are pheonominal, and definetly unique. If you've ever played massive online sandbox fps, for example, Planetside 2, you will know the kind of online experiences to expect, however unlike other sandbox MMOs, the experiences you get with Arma, are changing. Its not a repetitive, boring, same old grind. Depending on what server you want to play on, you can find yourself, playing with other players against AIs, using modern military tatics and utilizing resources to save a down player pilot, or you can find yourself running drugs in the cover of night trying to evade player police. As long as I have played Arma III, I cannot say that it has been boring for me. However this game is not for everyone, so if your not into the sandbox effect, i would continue on with your day, but if you enjoy unique experiences, and a endless interaction, then I highly recommend Arma III.
4347	1	a	this games cool except i cant get it f my life
4349	1	a	Arma 3..so far this is the best game of the Arma series, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Arma 2 and all it had to offer and Arma 3 continued that for me, the game is much smoother and alot easier to play yet still keeping that challenging aspect it originally had, the modding community for this game is amazing and some of the stuff I have seen made and played makes the game itself better than what it already was, for anyone skeptical of moving from Arma 2 to this, don't be, It's worth the buy.
4351	1	a	There is nothing quite like this game when you are in a full scale firefight, exchanging rounds, helicopters flying over head, your squadmates moving to flank the other team. You aren't alone in this battlefield though, many other firefights could be taking place anywhere on the map. You have free range to go where ever you'd like on the maps which are HUGE. Be forwarned though, you'll want to either ride or drive a vehicle if you have to run anywhere over a couple kilometers. Another warning that this game is NOT like Call of Duty, or Battlefield. It has a much more realistic feeling and is much harder, doesn't have an rpg system of leveling up, and you there isn't a scoreboard. That being said when you pull of something tactical with your squad, or do a combined strike with your team it is so rewarding and fun. There are mods for those of you that don't like just the base game. I haven't played breaking point, but I believe it is much like DayZ (a zombie survival mod with perma-death). There is also king of the hill, wasteland, and a few other things. I mostly play the game for multiplayer, but there is a mission editor to make missions, or to just spawn stuff and fight. There is also an episodic campaign that BI is releasing. Mod tools have just recently been released. The game is early in it's life and is going to hit full stride in a matter of months. If you want to see what's capable check out how ARMA 2 is now. Now on to opinions of techincal things.   The sounds in this game are amazing, and the graphics are also phenomenal for such large maps. The lighting is crazy good especially at night. The physics are a little iffy, and there are quite a few bugs. This is to be expected with such a large world though. This is the only game where I actually jump when I get shot at, and find myself instinctly ducking at my computer. There are only two maps, Altis and Stratis. The enviroments have a great mixture from grasslands and forests to villages or cities. In terms of content ARMA 2 has much more, but I believe as the game starts to get older the community and BI will start releasing A LOT more stuff. ARMA 3's urban fighting is awesome. I love it, but ARMA 2 does long engagements better I think. The game is pretty demanding I run it on high with a 7850 XFX Black Edition 2GB, 12 GB RAM, Phenom x6 Thuban 3.2GHz and get okay FPS. The community isn't awful like other FPS games. I love this game for the realistic, tactical, and strategic fighting that everyone has to do. There are mods for other things which makes me think this game has something for everyone.   I would recommend this game to someone who is looking for a more mature, serious, and hardcore community than most other first person shooters, as well as looking for a game that is more realistic and team based. If the person loved to play lone wolf, wanted anything they wanted in content right this second, or was easily angered by a bug here and there I wouldn't recommend it to them.   TL;DR - Graphics, Sounds, Lighting all amazing. Urban combat is better than ARMA 2. This game is for the person who wants a hyper-realistic first person shooter with heavy emphasis on team work that doesn't mind a bug here and there, and isn't bothered by waiting for more content for a little while.
4353	1	a	Really an amazing game will all the different mods that one can play.  Eg. best mods for me is WASTELAND, ALTIS LIFE AND BREAKING POINT. 
4355	1	a	Really fun, but a different kind of fun than your typical shooter. This is about planning, bringing the right gear, the right friends, the right objectives and trying to execute the plan. Even with the AI on the lowest possible setting, they're geniuses compared to any other shooter out there. Take your time, be patient and work your way through the objective. Fun under the right circumstances
4357	1	a	Amazing game if you give it a chance and tinker with it. Mods ALiVE and ACE (When released) especially has changed this game for the better don't knock it for the odd issue here or there the community are the guys who make this game really shine.   Only advice I can offer is get part of a community to really enjoy this game after all the makers gave us the sandbox but its the community who make the sandcastles out of this game!
4359	1	a	I would fully recommend this game, it is fun, and amazing. Who ever is a fan of realism shooters, this will be it!  I have been a fan of ArmA all the way from the beginning from the first games that was Operation Flashpoint, to where it is today. With ArmA you will have hours of fun, whether it is building missions, messing around in the editor or downloading the countless mods that are available on Workshop and  Armaholic.com!   Would fully recommend 10/10!
4361	1	a	Arma 3 is the bbbeeesssttttt!!!!!!!!!
4363	1	a	An amazing step up from ArmA 2 with better graphics and smoother gameplay while still retaining the core principles that make ArmA what it is. Now with the first part of the campaign released, it finally feels like the complete package with a gripping and interesting story. If you in any way enjoyed ArmA 2 then buy this because you won't be dissapointed.
4365	1	a	Solid single player campaign so far, and the multitude of community missions means your hard pressed to run out of new missions to play. But this game really shines when it comes to large coop missions.  I also recommend Sa-Matra's version of the Wasteland mission over the others.
4367	1	a	In brief: - If you're an Arma enthusiast, Arma 3 is a _must_! - If you don't know the Arma series, this game is a MUST :) !  Infantry simulator, with the ability to drive vehicles (Land, Air, Sea) with high degree of fidelity and real simulation. Physics, gameplay, story (for single players), graphics. The game is just awesome.  Warning: if you're picky (might commit suicide on the first pseudo-bug encountered) or you like FPS action, John-Wayne-style, this IS NOT for you. This is more a simulator than a shoot-em-up game, where tactics, speed of wit and experience play an invaluable role in the missions. And sometimes, things don't behave as expected... But rarely... But it happens...  However, if you like to zero up/down your sniper scope to compensate for the distance, if it makes you happy to carry a couple of weapons in your backpack, your magazines in your bandolier and night vision goggles on your combat helmet, if it matters for you to enter a vehicle and find most of the internals working (like speed/fuel/RPM gauges, mirrors, screens...), if you like UAV's and small drones that fit in your backpack, if you like to select your ammo type (tracer, belt, regular mag), if you find it awesome to play in an environment with kilometers of view-distance, if it engages you to play a game where there is no health bar, but every bullet counts (both the ones you deliver or receive), if you like to customize the game and create your own scenarios and campaigns and play them with your friends, if you like to play Zeus (yup, the Greek God, with the Lightning bolt)... If... If... If all (or most) of the above apply to you, well, this game is for you.  This is one of the games I can't recommend enough.
4369	1	a	Good Sim where all mistakes are punished by death.
4371	1	a	A good soldier is fast, accurate and effective in dealing with his weapons - all weapons in Arma 3 have realistic ballistics and handling. Adjust your weapon to compensate for the bullet drop, go into a squat or on the floor to reduce the recoil, and fire at short intervals in order to reduce scattering of ammunition. If you do not observe these points, your opponent has easier time to gain the upper hand.  With 270 km Â², the island Altis is the real star in Arma 3 From large-scale cities over rolling hills to wind and solar farms - regardless of whether the layers flattened rolls with your tank in the south or cause an asymmetric war of the hills in the north, the landscape of Altis offers extremely detailed locations with numerous combat options.  One of the best military simulators at the time, along with the stunning new engine, and the variety of mods a good game.  79/100
4373	1	a	.
4375	1	a	Best military simulator ever. Try the survival Mod Breaking Point  www.thezombieinfection.com .
4377	1	a	Awesome game! I love it. Looking forward to the expansions and mods being released for this!
4379	1	a	Less hollywood, more tactics.   Features and Pros: - 3 Campaigns. - Edit your own SP/MP missions. - Over 100 player online games (including co-op). - Huge map (I'm not kidding). - Drivable vehicles including jets and submarines. - Massive mod community. - Impressive visuals. - Night and day cycle. - Encourages tactical executions (get it wrong and you're all dead).  Cons: - Steep learing curve. - Although the effects are good, fire fights may not satisfy those who want a BF4 type experience. - AI can be frustratingly dumb at times, but are not bad most of the time. - Automatic spotting (as far as I'm aware, you can't manually spot an enemy).  Note: - Tanks and helicopters may seem over powered. This is because in real life they are. It forces weaker forces to adjust their engagement methods to succeed; Hit and run could be one of them.
4381	1	a	tl;dr: Better gameplay, controls, sound &amp; graphics then ArmA 2 however it has way less content atm.  ArmA 3 is better suited for those who want a more 'Casual' ArmA experience it's less of a simulator and more of a game this time and it shows with the greatly improved controls where it feels like you are playing a proper FPS and not a clunky simulator.  The first part of the singleplayer campaign is the only good ArmA campaign i have experienced and i did play all of the ArmA 2 campaigns so they did a good job there and i'm looking forward to the next part of the campaign.  Because of it's improved controls it's a lot more enjoyable to play it singleplayer then it was in previous games which means that you will have hundreds of hours of enjoyment just playing through all the singleplayer missions on the Steam Workshop.  Because of the modding contest there will hopefully be tons of content coming up soon and i'm looking forward to the near future of ArmA 3.  As to the multiplayer side of things there are already a ton of fun gamemodes and missions out there, however as always the best way to play ArmA is with a ArmA community playing on private servers.  Overall it's worth buying man just get it already.
4383	1	a	It's a pretty good driving simulator if that's what your looking for. On top of the endless bugs, explosions, and hikes, you'll find tons of different gamemodes and mods. The modding community really holds this together and without them this would probably be a piece of trash. After the first ten minutes, using the three guns supplied in the vanilla version of this game will get boring. This game is unfinished and shouldn't be bought.   I give it a 10/10
4385	1	a	It's GREAT! Just, if you don't like those complex controls, then i wouldn't recommend it, but if you can get used to it easily, YOU'RE SET! Overall, Great game
4387	1	a	So the campaign is complete. A lot of folks are still having the BF4 or A3 discussion (argument). Here's what I found. A3 is not without its faults. One of the biggest apects of the game is that it's aimed at the 'thinker'. What I mean by that is that you have endless ways to achieve your goals, but yes in being a milsim you can be taken out by a lucky shot from a guy you never saw (with pinpoint AI targeting) from 500yrds away.   For some folks that's the heart of endless frustration and this is not the game for you. BF4 shouldn't be bashed either, it's simply for a group of folks that want action and eye candy - and it delivers on both of those in spades. A3 has amazing visuals in my opinion, yet they are harder to appreciate because so much tweaking is required to get decent FPS while keeping some of the visual goodies.   It's the fact that A3 is ridiculously hard sometimes, and requires a huge time investment compared to most games, that make it so satisfying when everything finally goes right. A3 gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other when everything hits the fan and you (or your teammates) quick thinking pays off for a win. Being able to jump into almost any vehicle or aircraft leave you feeling that you can be the ultimate ____________ (tank driver, helo pilot, fixed wing ace etc...).   Yes BF4 has some of these components, but delivered in a completely different way. Run, gun, get shot a bunch of times, hide, heal, and do it over again. And that's completely ok if that's you're style of gameplay and what you enjoy. A3 plan, plan, plan some more, cross a huge amount of terrain that can literally take hours on foot, and get shot by a dude you never saw, or...) make the hard win. You will dump huge amounts of time into A3 to be decent at it (plenty of folks don't have that kind of time to commit). BF4 get on..play for a match or two and leave if you want.   BF4 has some great DLC's the latest carrier edition looks awesome. A3 has mod...after mod...after mod. With a workshop full of missions (horrible to great), plus a community that's pretty engaging and helpful.   For me it's A3 all the way!
4389	1	a	If you are after something different from the mainstream 'CoD' style shooter and need something realistic, then this is perfect. I'm an ex British soldier and I can tell you that this is a close as it gets to reality!
4391	1	a	Brilliant best war simulator ever!
4393	1	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing! Really fun to play, but has a bit of a learning curve. Can be hard tp play at time for people new to the Arma series. This game is a must buy for anyone who likes FPS games.
4395	1	a	By far the best War simulator out there. It's just as realistic as you make it.  What steals the show is the landscape, beautiful mountains and villages make for a nice scenery to battle in.  Giving it a 9/10
4397	1	a	good game but needs more modes
4399	1	a	The game is still buggy but it doesn't stop the fun to be had here. If you are a fan of DayZ then you will love the Wasteland mod that is very popular in the Arma series. Arma 3 does have a campaign mode but that is only the beginning. Modders have made this one of the most infinitely replayable games on steam. There are hundreds of downloadable missions to play and a community that is willing to teach you how to play them.  I cant recommend this game enough. If you like games like Red Orchestra and SOCOM then this is the game for you. It might be 60 bucks but, in my opinion, it is worth it. I have put over 100 hours in this game and feel like I have barely scratched the surface.  TLDR: Just buy it.
4401	1	a	it is just so awesome
4403	1	a	One word can describe this game: Awesome. Arma 3 is a realistic military sim. Even with that in mind, for those who don't enjoy the realism, this game is one of the best FPS ever created and offers something for everyone. Map sizes are ridiculous, think of an average GTA IV map, times that by ten. Vehicle mechanics are greatly improved over Arma II, which makes them fun to drive, and gives you another sense of immersion. When your driving an armored vehicle, you actually feel empowered. As for weapons, the quality of the models, and the sound bytes are amazing. It's not like your average FPS....With headphones, every weapon sounds exactly like it would in real life, not some PEW PEW sound.   I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a boredom cure, with community made mods and game types, there is something in it for everyone.
4405	1	a	Good game and lots of mods so you never get bored   Breaking Point, Waste Land, Altis Life just to name a few!!!! 
4407	1	a	If you like DayZ kinda action, and you are willing to RPG. Altis life Mod for Arma 3 is verry Cool, look up a good community and get your life going. Get a job: Pick Apples, peaches, Mine for Iron, copper, Salt and even Diamonds. Become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. Become a Cop, arrest ppl. Search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. You can even become a rebel. Before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. The server i play on the most: Serverfilter: Trinity Join me.
4409	1	a	:)
4411	1	a	absolutely the best Arma by far i just cant seem to stop playing it.
4413	1	a	This game is 10/10, I love it. Definatly a big step from ArmA II 
4415	1	a	good game and game play
4417	1	a	Loving them graphics. Great game
4419	1	a	of cos
4421	1	a	is it good for a windows 8 HP laptop?  
4423	1	a	10/10, most fun I've had in any multiplayer Steam game.
4425	1	a	HELL FREAKIN YEA! Buy this, this just shows the power of the PCMASTERRACE! Best exclusive ever, i reccomend this series more than any other game, everyone needs the chance to play this game. I reccomend it more than any other game ive ever played, most amazing thing that ever happend to me. BUY IT!
4427	1	a	AN EXTRAORDINARY GAMING EXPERIENCE! THE MOST 'MUST HAVE' GAME AT THE WHOLE STORE.
4429	1	a	Arma 3 is almost like Arma 2, besides alot of gameplay has changed! The guns now have attachments you can take on and off, clotching that you swip out with a drag'n drop on. Body armor actually works in this game, and mostly everything else does aswell Great game overall, I would highly recommend it if you have a BEAST computer as the maps are HUGE and eats up your framerate! :) 
4431	1	a	Hide while snipers endlessly shoot at you with there guns that sound like clickers
4433	1	a	Well, after a few hundred hours, I can say I love this game. Even though the price is steap (after 2 years), and the learning curb is huge, the game is fun. Once you get used to the performance of the game, you learn to deal with the other bugs. The community is great, and most are 14+. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes realism and real punishment for failure. 9/10
4435	1	a	Its really wel done!Awsome game!
4437	1	a	I have played over 500 hours on this game now (OMG!!),  Since the first time i played this game, every minute on it has been worth while. The amound of different game modes on this game is endless. Altis Life, Battle Royal, King Of The Hill and much more!!.  Personally i enjoy Altis Life the best as i have found an amazing communtity to play with  (sawclan.net) . This game is so fun and is worth every single penny.   The graphics on this game is amazing especially when you find yourself in the middle of no-where, the views are out of this world.  Overall i reccomend this game as it can fill everybody's needs, apart from some of the hakers that decide to ruin this game (but every game has this), this is one of the best games out there!!
4439	1	a	Arma 3 is a good game, but it is still a Work In Progress. There are many bugs and glitches that will be punched out as time goes by, but that shouldn't keep you from buying the game. Look at Arma 2, it has become a huge success, mostly tahnks to DayZ but its RP aspect. Arma 3 is a truly Next-Gen game which is capable of doing so much. Buy it, don't ask any questions, just do it.
4441	1	a	its the bes, has a varity of mods its awesome!!
4443	1	a	Arma2 with some new weapon stances, granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode.  Definately worth getting with discount - would not recommend paying full price if u got Arma II already.
4445	1	a	I've been waiting for a game like this my whole life without even knowning it. Quite possibly the best shooting game ever made.
4447	1	a	This is an amazing game! Quit looking at these reviews and buy it already!
4449	1	a	Fantastic games with a good variety of community made missions/mods etc.  If you were an avid ArmA 2 player, you'll love Arma 3!  The only problem I could see with this game is that it's quite diffrent from other shooter games, and maybe a little hard to get into without help from friends that have already been playing this or arma 2.
4451	1	a	Amazing game! Alot of different community made gamemodes available.
4453	1	a	Very good game, I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semi-realistic war sim. This game struggles heavly from optimization issues. I have an i5 3570K at 4.4 GHz and a GTX 760. At best this game will use 60% of my CPU and or GFX card and only getting 25-40 FPS at 1920x1080 in a busy server. In single player I can get up to 80-90 FPS. Changing my GFX settings really wont change my FPS more than about 10%. 9/10
4455	1	a	i am a MASSIVE fan of all arma games and i can say after a dodgy release bohemia interactive have eventually have brought this game to close perfection and with visuals like this, i am hooked. if you are new to arma i recommend starting here, it gives you clear instructions and a smooth campaign (thats if you can run it). it has nice, mature, loyal and welcoming community (with the occasional your mum joke) that does not hesitate to mod and create user made missions, so boredom is rare. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deeper fps experience.
4457	1	a	Very Fun. I would recommend this game to multiple people.
4459	1	a	i love this game  well worth the 30 bucks from steam sale  
4461	1	a	good job bohemia. this game is worth the money
4463	1	a	Shooting flying submarines with lightning, 10/10
4465	1	a	i endorse this product and/or service
4467	1	a	OMG. When I need to rub one out, I play Arma III. Seriously... I beat my meat like it owes me money while driving the vehicles.   Also, this is a good game.
4469	1	a	think its a good game but you need a good pc to play this game but apart from that its a good decent game
4471	1	a	ive played arma for about a good 3 years now went i first got arma 3 i liked it i was very excited but then  theres something im really annoyed by the game would like randomly crash and send me to my desktop every 1 hour or 30 minutes every tim i still recommend this game but thats the only thing i think would be a huge step to fix
4473	1	a	Outstanding military simulator like its predecessor, but be warned of its poor optimization as it will bring even the best gaming rigs to its knees.
4475	1	a	Military simulator with extremely large maps, lots of different modes, and vehicles. Spent a lot of time on Breaking Point mod, it's very fun and rewarding.
4477	1	a	sick AF CCCC
4479	1	a	It's alright.
4481	1	a	First things first. This review is more like comparing to previous Arma titles.  This game is massive. With gigantic maps, lots of venicles and weapons you will have lots of fun. Gameplay is more fluid than previous game. Graphics has been improved and look gorgeous and performes nicely. There are lots of problems with CPU optimalization which can be fixed by startup command but still should be considered. Also there are tons of bugs but considering scale of things in this title it can be understood. As previous instalments Arma 3 comes with editor and is fully modable.  There is new stance adjustment system which is pretty usefull in close combat. But glitches in PhysX, not giving highly requested features in game and so on are serious problem which however can be fixed in patches.  You will not receive lots of missions like in previous titles but on workshop you can find lots of high quality mission which should compensate this.  In whole i recomend to buy Arma 3 if you want tactical game which can be incredibly rewarding and punishing at the same time. It still fells like original Operation Flashpoint but also fells lot improved.  For new players: Game plays lot diferently than other games. You must think how to aprouch enemy and so on. Run n' gun is not going to work here. You must think in this game.  English is not my native language and therefore i apologize for all my mistakes in this review.
4483	1	a	Best FPS by a longshot. That simple.
4485	1	a	Really fun with friends atlis life for the win or king of hill
4487	1	a	Very good game. The campaign is a large step up from Arma 2 being both interesting, enjoyable, somewhat challenging and free from annoying AI leaders and teammates. Multiplayer is varied with both casual servers and clan servers with large battles occuring. The maps are both beautiful and varied, it is also a good template for mission makers. The main part of Arma III, however is the mods and missions created by the community, this is what Arma is all about. User created missions vary from single player stealth mission to large battles from land and air, there are even some more creative mission that allow you to become other things like a police officer. BIS have given the community an enjoyable game which doubles up as a template for a large amount of mods and missions both new and old. There are however some problem namely the optimisation. The is very laggy, there is however some solutions and after a bit of tweaking the game should be very playable. Squad management is still time comsuming but after some practice (from the campaign) it does become slightly easier. Overall Arma III is an excellent game and has set out on what it was going to achieve: Become an interesting and enjoyable game while allowing the community to create excellent mods and missions. Dont listen to people complaining about optimisation and content because optimisation can be solved with a google search and content can easily be fleshed out by those who have excellently contributed to the game on things such as the workshop and Armaholic. This game is worth every penny. 
4489	1	a	A great improvement over the second game. Animations are very good and fluid, alot of the clunky controls have been alleviated. The games visuals are pretty nice. Multiplayer is where this game truly shines, however to play at a stable framerate in multiplayer, you are going to need an above average PC unless you are willing to do some config changes and graphic downgrades. All in all, I recommend this game. It's worth its price in terms of content, and it has workshop compatibility.
4491	1	a	A fantastic game for those who love the ArmA series. The Game uns very smooth and there are many things to do with the editor and even the Multiplayer. Gaphics are insanes aswell as the animantions and even the gun play seems a bit better. i would recommend this game to any friends.  - this is a cpu intensive game and would recommend you to use a higher end cpu and gpu if needed.
4493	1	a	Great game. Great successor of the previous one. A must have for every military enthusiast!
4495	1	a	It's ok, kinda laggy, hopefully they optomize for mid-end computers in the future.
4497	1	a	Excellent game, very easy to interact with the enviroment with the many poses etc.
4499	1	a	pretty awesome
4501	1	a	One of the best and most realistic modern shooters out there. Great online content and community. Good campaign. Amazing graphics. Well worth the money if you're looking for an open world, modern shooter.
4503	1	a	
4505	1	a	Must play game !!!
4507	1	a	For all those people out there who think CoD and Battlefield are noch tactical enough Arma 3 is the game of choice. Awesome Multiplayer action for example in King of the Hill and the great modifications (Breaking Point, Altis Life) make this game my #1 at the moment.
4509	1	a	This is the train simulator for all people wanting to invaid greece. It has many civilians ready for you to dominate with such force as gun, tank, plane, boat. You can steal van and drive like Niko in GTA. The bad guys in 300 deffinatly should of played this game before they tried to get sparta. The best part is the plane. So speed, such sound, wow.
4511	1	a	Might be a bit expensive but overall after buying it it was hella fun and can spend hours upon hours on it with all the mods and things to do 
4513	1	a	if you like butt stuff you will like arma 3. all praise the booty.
4515	1	a	One of the best combined arms simulations i have ever played. The gameplay is only hindered by the people and community you play with. Play with an exciting group of people or with friends and you will have all the funny, stupid, and downright awsome moments you can only have in a few combined arms game. However playing by your self is not always boring but not always fun. So what are you waiting for try this game out and if you want find a good clan to hang out with and have fun.
4517	1	a	A very incredible game, super realistic. With the ability to add community made mods it just adds that much more to the scope of the game. Now with the 'Zeus' functionality which allows players to edit missions on the fly it makes mission creation that much easier. This series is a game that every harcore military gamer should have in their library. The only negative to this game is the FPS drop when too many units are in an area. But thats about the only negative that I can think of.
4519	1	a	got shot in the head and died instantly, 10/10
4521	1	a	Hours of Entertainment
4523	1	a	Nvidia GTX 780 = $800 ASUS 24' 1080p Monitor = $300 Playing on all lows and still getting 10fps = ArmA 3
4525	1	a	love the vids but i wish it was cheaper 
4527	1	a	ArmA 3 brings a new aspect to gaming and to simulation gaming. Being a leading developer in military simulation BIS strived and excelled it's past accomplishments with ArmA 2 and it's DLCs. Me being in the military I enjoy this game. From playing ArmA 2, and it's DLCs, BIS has done a wonderful job with this one. From customizing your weapons to playing CAS in it's new A-164 Wipeout. ArmA 3 brings future warfare to today's technology.   Personal Rating: 09/10    Edited: 20140619
4529	1	a	GREAT GAME 100% awesome you can do so many things
4531	1	a	This is war..
4533	1	a	i own my own prizza oven, you can add as many toppings as you want and it doesn't cost you extra
4535	1	a	Too good....... well that was easy
4537	1	a	YES I LOVE THIS GAME! I ALWAYS GET KIDNAPPED! ITS ALWAYS A FUN WAY TO LEARN WHY PEOPLE KIDNAP YOU FOR COCAINE...
4539	1	a	most def one of the best shooters i have ever played
4541	1	a	My hours on record should speak for the game itself, its only in beta and already is such a fun game, sure the AI are a little buggy but wasteland, coop, hell even just playing helicopter tag is fun. Its a sandbox game so you can spawn in stuff in the editor and create a mission and then play it however you want to. One of the greats of our generation going beyond anything call of duty, battle field, halo have done or probably will do I highly recommend this game.
4543	1	a	Cats R furry!
4545	1	a	An undeniably accurate military simulator, no other game like it (yes, COD boys and BF fans, this is very different indeed). Developed by actual military personel, this game is designed to be as realistic to military combat, tactics, and realismas humanly possible. I've played ArmA II for years and never did I imagine a game, designed for the sole purpose of military simulations, take on the challenge of becomeing a modern day platform of ArmA III.
4547	1	a	It's great.
4549	1	a	Much improved over Arma II. Loads of downloadable content especially for multiplayer/co-op. The AI is smart enough so that each scenario is not exactly the same every time. On the down side, development seems to be a bit slow. There are still some glitches, and patches aren't released regularlly. Some of the keystrokes take some getting used to. If you are using mouse/keyboard, do yourself a favor and practice flying the helos before attempting to use them in missions.  4/5 stars.... with potential! Loads of fun to play
4551	1	a	This is sick! depending on the type of game, you can team up in wasteland, have an all out war in team death match, snipers are amazing, so many rifles, 3 rocket launchers with a laser guidence system, grenades, smoke, and mortors! i love it
4553	1	a	I would highly recommend this game. It's fun and i've already put some hours on the board in a short period of time.
4555	1	a	Arma 3 is the most pure PC game in the world. 10/10
4557	1	a	Great game 8/10 but servers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Need optimization bad.
4559	1	a	Great Game!   I would Recommend To those who love First Person/Third Person Shooters and Realistic Shooters  Cant get anymore real than this :)
4561	1	a	My one word reveiw 'Amazing'
4563	1	a	Arma 3 is that type of game where its not just a Bloodshed battle but it has tactics and strategys that makes it realistic and fun
4565	1	a	War Simulator, not like Call Of Duty this is not fast paced. If you get shot you die.
4567	1	a	Such an awesome game !,.....myself, i like wasteland mode the most :D,..But i hate life mode -_- because i have no idea what to do on it,....
4569	1	a	Amazing military sandbox game that lets you create anything you can imagine!
4571	1	a	Arma 3 is one hell of a game the shear possiblites are limitless you can kill and be killed in so many ways i give this a sure ' Thumbs Up.'
4573	1	a	was alright, played very smoothly and looked amazing but when it came to flying/ learning to operate drones it was very confusing and not very well though out, also the online servers didn't work that well was ether glitchy or wouldn't work, or just won't load. if your looking for a multiplayer this would be good if it worked right for single player if you like cod you might like this.
4575	1	a	Arma 3 is a great open world Simulation Military Shooter. It's not like your normal run and gun shooter. The game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful. Arma 3 give you a large variety and options, kind of like battlefield 4. Youâ€™re able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter (not as easy as other games) or drive a tank. Bohemia Interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well, it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not. I recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game. I donâ€™t recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counter-strike.
4577	1	a	Arma 3 is a very fun, open world game. It has an extremely large modding community, and is widely played by those throughout the world. It contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you and/or others to play together. It has a unique scripting lanuage, which is difficult to learn at the beginning, but is very flexible once you learn it. The community has much variation, from player age, experience, heritage, etc. and is a great game for those who really like Combat/Strategy.
4579	1	a	Brandon is silly for not buying this game. It's a fun game. You can go diving, who doesnt want to go diving.
4581	1	a	love itlooks better then DAY Z
4583	1	a	Look at the hours i've played, a awesome step up from arma 2 with better graphics and a more intutive interface with more advance servers. Overall a great game to buy if you like military simulations or simulations in general.
4585	1	a	A true military simulator for the skilled player. If you enjoy FPS games like COD and Battlefield but want to take a step up into the real gaming world, this is your' game!
4587	1	a	I can't say enough good things about ARMA 3. This is a game for someone who wants a truly lifelike military sandbox. This is not COD or BF; for the most part, run and gun tactics will only get you shot and killed here. You will have to think quickly and thoroughly to plan your assaults, escapes, etc. You will die a lot initially until you learn how to properly strategize and utilize the assets at your disposal but you will have fun doing it.   The Bohemia content is a blast to play and replay but where this game really shines is in the wealth of community created content that offers something for everyone. The level editor makes it easy to create your own scenarios and tailor missions to your specific desires and play styles. Truth be told I would pay the $60.00USD for this game just to play the Breaking Point mod (think DayZ using Arma3 engine/maps) but either way, the game was well worth the money.
4589	1	a	This game is better than watching an all-autistic soccer match.
4591	1	a	This game is really fun to play with friends.
4593	1	a	Been playing this game for about 8 months now and thought I'd publish my review of this game. When I first started to play the game I was new to Arma so didn't know the controls, it was quite tricky to figure out all the different controls but after a week or 2 I got to grips with most of it.   If you like real battles and the strategy of it then I would buy this game, you will enjoy it very much. The game is more in depth compared to other games like Battlefield for example, it's more realistic which is why I started playing it.   The graphics in game look amazing and the way they made the maps are very good also so if you have a good graphics card you will see the benefit on high settings.   The best thing about the game is there is many different mods you can play which I never realised before but i've had so much fun playing different ones.   Really you are buying this game but getting several of them for free as the mods are totally different to the others but still the same weapons and such but it feels different in how you play so buying it is very worth while it's mainly all I play it's that good.
4595	1	a	so good game i love this game :)
4597	1	a	With Arma, you will either love it or hate it. And if you happen to the one of the lucky ones, Arma 3 will keep you coming back for years, with a vast amount of content and replayability, I don't think I've ever experienced a situation the same way twice. With a control scheme that allows for finer movements and positioning and a map that is just oozing with detail. If you enjoyed Arma 2 (or Arma 1 for that matter) I would spare no time in picking this one up.
4599	1	a	This game is fantastic if you enjoy games that require you to work as a team to complete objectives. Grab some friends jump on a server and let the team building begin. Prefer to go solo? Well the Campaign is absolutley spectacular. Still not interested? You can always play with the mods that are always coming out and being updated. In short there is something for everyone.
4601	1	a	This is the best FP(Tactical)S by far, I don't think there is any real competition out there. Unlike most other FPS's, this gem of a game has longevity. Yes you have a Campaign Mode and other SinglePlayer/Multiplayer scenarios {made by an ever growing army of fans} which you can download from the ARMA III Workshop but you also get to create your own missions in the Mission Editor/Creator, I don't think there are many(if any) other FPS's that offer that much depth in their games.
4603	1	a	Fantastic game, As an Arma II player, seeing the new advances in ArmaIII is quite outstanding and provies for a more enjoyable expierence.
4605	1	a	really good game. If you liked ArmA 2... You Will Like ArmA 3 Better!
4607	1	a	Honestly this game touches me in places a woman never could.
4609	1	a	Great game, great mods! 10/10
4611	1	a	A great game, includes lots of mods, You can join an exhilerating battle. You can roleplay your way the the top of a city or even an island. You can even use, and help your teamates in order to achieve victory. An amazing game all around.
4613	1	a	Fun and very realistic,
4615	1	a	Unparalleled realism.   Amazing graphics and sound that take advantage of higher end machines.  Gameplay so intricate and suspenseful - the only true war SIMULATOR.  The modding community shines, with great missions from specifc PvE sets, to PvP battles, to full on RPG's.   It might not be the most fast-paced shooter - but when a well cooridinated assault kicks in, the fireworks can make the most over-the-top blockbuster shooter sequences look like cartoons. The suspense of being killed with one shot, of not knowing whether or not you've been spottted, or trying to overwhlem an attacking or defending force provides tangible investment in your gameplay. The realism of the weapons, vehicles, and physics simply has no competition. If you want real, and NOT arcade, this is the ticket.  This game thrives when playing with other communicating humans, and therein provides a war game experience that is addictingly engaging and entirely unique to ArmA.
4617	1	a	The graphical beauty of this game is incredible and the game is among the most realistic combat games out there. However don't be mistaken this is by no means in the same catagory as other gun games out there. This does not play like an FPS at all, which in many cases I like. My only complaint with the series is how rough the game is with almost everything you do. Not going to rant on about it, but anyone who plays this can't deny that nothing you do flows very well, getting in a vehicle or doing something like hopping over a fence isn't quick and smooth. It almost feels like it stops the gameplay or combat... gets in the vehicle ...then it resumes. (hard to explain this given that makes it just sound like every other game but trust me when I say it isn't the same)   NOW TO MAKE UP FOR THAT COMPLAINT, the game is fantastic, you really do feel like a soldier, and the range of gamemodes you'll find on servers etc. is endless! Finally to wrap it up they give you two massive maps that allow for very fun fights.
4619	1	a	I have been playing this game for a couple of months and this game is worth it. Arma 3 has so much to do and I reccommend it.
4621	1	a	Best gaming experience in my hole life this game take gaming to a hole new level. absolutely amazing. controls are quite a problem first but you will get used to it in a day or 2. buy now!
4623	1	a	Over 1000 hours across all my accounts of fun. Every PC gamer should play this game. 10/10
4625	1	a	This game is the most amazing game I have ever played! I do not usually post reviews, and if I do they are usually for negative feedback but arma deserves any and all posative feed back.
4627	1	a	this is a great game. only got it about a week ago and ever since ive been playing it nonstop... great animations. only question is how to download Takistan Life?
4629	1	a	For some reason, i get up in the morning while there is sun outside.  When im done playing its and look out of my window again, its always really late at night for some reason
4631	1	a	All around good fun. Civ life or Arma life.
4633	1	a	Awesome game 10/10 very fun, exciting and fast paced.
4635	1	a	Although it is riddled with simple movement glitches and errors the combat immersion is unmatched with most games. This game has given me many adrenaline rushes and jump scares that even horror games can't give. 8/10
4637	1	a	Best tactical shooter our there!
4639	1	a	best military simulation ever
4641	1	a	awesome sim. many servers are still under development but it feels very real to play the game.
4643	1	a	this game is just to good
4645	1	a	A very underated game definitely deserves 85+/100 just take some getting use to and adjustments!
4647	1	a	great combat sim be it as infantry or pilot, big platform, beautiful engine, lots of mods, different MP gameplays, great community, lots of sleepless nights when conducting large organized warfares it's the closest sim to real life, u either love it or hate it - there is no in between ;)
4649	1	a	this game is amazing :D 10/10 btw u need a good pc to run this
4651	1	a	Beast game, if you have a comp to support it. If not, you can still sit in spawn and pretend you are doing something useful 10/10
4653	1	a	I camped in a Gunstore for 5 days and it took 3 tries with a tank and MG crew to dislodge me. 11/10
4655	1	a	Kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth.   If you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality, this is a must buy even at it's pricepoint.
4657	1	a	I cant fly nor do I like to annoy people..  Only kidding, I lurb arma!
4659	1	a	This game copied off of call of duty. Run and gunners get 37 kills while the 37 campers scratch their balls and die. Then they have these a.i missions made by babies for babies. Easiest game I have ever played gonna have to give it 0/10 no quickscoping.
4661	1	a	This game is so much fun and each time i play it i cannot stop playing it.. If you play with friends it makes it that much better but without friends i have the same amount of fun.
4663	1	a	Great
4665	1	a	It looks sweet, runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it :/
4667	1	a	Decent game, although a bit graphics intensive. Uber-realistic. Have fun finding enemies...
4669	1	a	The thinking mans shooter. Also hilarious physics glitches AND one of the most active and diverse modding communities out there. If you like shooting things, but dont have the reflexes for CS anymore, get this. Its amazing!
4671	1	a	If you like anyting military than this is the game for you!! There are tons of fun multiplayer game modes ranging from RPGS, Sandboxes and Sector Controls. The single player is just as fun using player created missions and mods. Or you can spend hours just messing around in the simple to use misson editor. The devs are great and keep supporting and updating it, Arma 3 is more like a platform than a game.  Overall Its one of the best games ive ever played and has the most content ive ever seen. Worth every penny!!!
4673	1	a	The most dangerous things in Arma 3 are as follows. -Stairs -AI -Rocks -Teammates -The car you are driving -The Enemy
4675	1	a	I Love this game.
4677	1	a	Found a tank Killed a naked guy Made millions :D
4679	1	a	Arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. Some of the popular gamemodes are King of the Hill, Battleroyale, and Wasteland. There are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. You can instlal different mods like guns, vehicles, missions and other things. Then theres Breaking Point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ GB) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. Last note is there is going to be a Arma 3 Epoch Namalsk map coming.
4681	1	a	Great game! I always loved the Arma Series it begon with OFP First Arma and the graphic's of this game are stunning! but i don't like the future vehicles ect but its awsome with mods :D
4683	1	a	My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever.  We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.  I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.  Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?  The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. 'SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!' he died after that. I cried and he respawned.  I would recommend getting :)
4685	1	a	This Game is a fun open world game if you have money and you like military play this GAME
4687	1	a	Awesome game if you like arma 2 you will love arma 3 despite the amazing graphics it plays pretty well and there is a ton to do. I'd say buy this game but at a risk of you may not be able to run it considering its such a cpu intensive game I hope you enjoy It like I have though Have Fun!
4689	1	a	From riding in a go-kart attached to a helicopter to stealing peoples organs for money(not that i do that :P). One of the best games ive ever played!
4691	1	a	fantastic game love every minute of it.
4693	1	a	If you liked ARMA 2, then you will love ARMA 3!  Because it is ARMA 2, with better graphics and less content. I bought it, so should you.  10/10, will have to create your own game to enjoy the game you just bought.
4695	1	a	Don't mistake this game for an FPS, some people enter into this game expecting COD ...it's not. ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you're not meant to feel invincible, if you don't take cover you'll die, if you don't communicate with your squad you'll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to, but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you're used to them you'll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body.  The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that's saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle.   Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get, Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it's not so common that it ruins things.  At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes. ARMA 3 is a military sim not 'insert FPS here' don't get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is 'cheap' or a 'noob' close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.
4697	1	a	I personally don't know what to say because writing a really long review is stupid. But i highly recommend this game, by far one of the best games i have played in my lifetime. The great mod support, the variety of gamemodes to choose from. Its just simply great. Buy it
4699	1	a	Very fun game and good mods !
4701	1	a	Really Good game, with a large number of mods! Buy it and play it!
4703	1	a	This game is almost the perfect PC game (in my oppinion) however it would be great if the game ran a little bit better but apart from that you can mod the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of it and spend hundreds of hours playing the various life mods!  12/10 - ME :D
4705	1	a	If you love military simulators or just plain out love the military this game is by far the best out of any other game to play. I have played Arma 2 and OA and ever since Arma 3 came out I have not touched arma 2 or OA. This game has a learning curve but ask people in multiplayer or play the campaign for help. Overall 10/10.
4707	1	a	Having played ArmA 2 for almost two years before ArmA 3 came out, I had high expectations for ArmA 3. Now, Before I get into specifics about the game, I have to say ArmA 3 is one of the best games you can get without having to buy any DLC to enjoy a full experience. ArmA 3 is an amazing first person shooter that involves a bit of strategy to win. Whether it means inserting into an enemy camp via SDV or hiking it across altis just to take an enemy helicopter for a spin, You have to come up with a plan to have a successful mission. Now, ArmA 3 isn't just about objectives and killing virtual entities. ArmA is about a massive multiplayer community made up of players, Mod Makers, Scripters, Cinematics Creators, and many more. If you think vanilla has an extremely large amount of content, Wait til you get a look at all of the mods and missions created by just the player base.   Pros  Extremely fun and adrenaline pumping gameplay Crazy amounts of mods available Extremely large and diverse player base Very well made models and objects High end graphics Not very many hackers Large amount of servers to choose from Lots of updates  Cons  Physics can sometimes be a bummer when attempting unusual missions or actions Can be hard to run for some people Can be a little hard to learn how to play Again, Physics  Overall, I give ArmA 3 a 10/10. This game has exceeded my expectations. I can replay this game everyday for a week and still not want to put it down. If you are looking for a first person shooter that involves a crazy amount of strategy and content, This is the game for you.
4709	1	a	According me it`s the best game in the world. I love this game.
4711	1	a	Its just Arma thats all
4713	1	a	Best war simulator
4715	1	a	it's good game  with friends only
4717	1	a	Fun game, a step up from the previous title
4719	1	a	This game is a whole new meaning of Awesome. The succesor of the very fun Arma 2, Arma 3 is beautiful and lively yet at the same time can become a giant battlefield of fun and thats why i love this game. If this hasn't convinced you to get this amazing game, well you're missing out.
4721	1	a	most satisfying game to win at!
4723	1	a	For all ppl who love military this is (for me) the best game you can find. Using tactics and strategy to win. I really enjoy the Tactical Realism Servers you need time for this but its just a great game. You almost think your in the fight ;) Oculus Rift and i think you have amazing fun and maybe some scary moments too :D  Sorry for long review and Greetz from germany :)
4725	1	a	The best Fps Sim ever!
4727	1	a	Huge Map Awesome Graphics Only in Arma moments  Not recommended for those that want a fast paced shooter or dont have a reasonable PC  Sweet game Thumbs up :)
4729	1	a	I THINK IT IS A EPIC GAME 
4731	1	a	Fun and open world game with really good gamemodes and lots of fun, Make sure your Pc can Handle the game before you get it though.
4733	1	a	this is an amazing game as a fps as well as enabling the player a truely immersive realism experiance the multiplayer experiance of the game is truely second to none with community members contributing maps and missions to the steam workshop as well as community modders hard at work the potential for this game is quite limitless
4735	1	a	I've had tons of fun in this game already and I'm far from done. Singleplayer can sometimes be a hassle. I've come across a bunch of issues in missions forcing me to restart them, but I suppose that goes for every advanced simulator.  If you're playing with friends you'll never get bored. Any sandbox gamemode will do. Wasteland, Altis Life, Invade &amp; Annex and so on...  This game does require an above average gaming computer.
4737	1	a	Really good game I give it a 10/10. After the heli dlc I havent been able to play it though it keeps crashing :( 0/10 
4739	1	a	:3
4741	1	a	NUMBER 1 FAVORITE GAME!!!
4743	1	a	best army game ever 10/10 trust me must buy!
4745	1	a	Best military sandbox out there. This is not just a game. It is a playground where you can wage war in any shape or form (with great graphics btw):  -Use land, water and air vehicles.  -Control a team.  -Use UAV's and stationary weapons.  -Play through immense maps from arma 3, arma 2 and others (like the new Bornholm). -Use gameplay mods that change drastically the way the game is played (Wasteland, Epoch, Life, Hunger games...) -The Zeus mode will let you create and edit any part of the game on the fly (be a god). -The list goes on and on.  The only thing that is not as polished as in other AAA war games is the cinematics, this is more a simlulator kind of game. But then, it's like comparing a toy car and a toy car made out of lego. Take it apart, put it together and you'll have a completely different toy.  Just to finish: DayZ came out of this concept (in arma 2). What else do you need to know?
4747	1	a	someone buy this for me
4749	1	a	Great game. DL the Breaking Point mod.
4751	1	a	Nice game, controlls are a bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up but you get used to it :D
4753	1	a	Arma3 I must say is ummmm...  Lets start over, Arma3 is a well thought out game by far. The mods are wonderful and most of the time you can't go to sleep after logging on :).  My opinion.  I believe with a little more optpmizing on server side/ Company side this game could not be beat out by any other game on the market. Arma3 is a mix of things.  If you want fast paced. BAM - ARMA3  If you want slow paced. BAM -ARMA3  If you want great and releastic gun fights/military simulated. BAM - ARMA3  If you want a very minimum amount of hackers (as in I have encountered 0, YES 0 in 258 hours time played. Then BAM -ARMA3  If you want great AI encounters. BAM - ARMA3  Want to pick from many different mod's... Epoch, Battleroyale, Altis Life RP, Wasteland, King oh the hill, choose what you like best.  Choppers, military vehicles, awsome guns, what more can you want.. oh yea 1000000 FPS :P  A few negatives are the bugs. 1. Dying randomly from stairs, getting in vehicles, falling 5 feet, falling 2 feet, running to fast :P,  2. vehicles blowing up for no reason, blowing up in garages from spawning in diferent directinons. 3. umm nothing else i guess :)   Arma3 I would by far recommend to any and everyone my first hour of gameplay I quit, uninstalled and did not try again for 4 months. Well then I was hooked. As long as you can run it due to the optimization your good to go, Hopefully in the future the updates will get pushed faster and less bugs but that wont stop me.  Give it a try you wont regret it.
4755	1	a	 This game is simply amazing.   I know the FPS may be bad at stages and the bugs and glitches may be annoying, but hey, it's ARMA. A3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods. Never can I say I have seen another game where I can screech in my F-18 Super Hornet over a bunch of ISIS Militants in a fictional town in the middle east. The multiplayer is simply amazing as well however, buggy at times. I did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when I added the necessary mods, it was a master piece.   9.8/10    TLDR -   PRO: Amazing game with great core gameplay  CON: Minor and Major bugs and FPS Issue Tip: Accompanied with right mods, it is a master piece
4757	1	a	I had a friend gift me Arma 3 and I always wanted to play it. Despite all of the negativity some people give it I enjoy the game myself. There is so much you can do in Arma 3 that sometimes it is hard to name them all. Having 893+ hours I think it is safe to say I would recommend to anybody. From super serious to very calm game modes Arma has it all. If you choose to get Arma3, see you on the battlefield.
4759	1	a	Easily one of the best shooters I have ever played. More Simlator then most claiming to be out there. Nothing like a 'C.O.D' or 'BF'. Great Game Highly Recomend It.
4761	1	a	I really do like this game, as it has open world maps, tons of content, mods, stuff like that. I recommend this game because of all the features it has its overall a great game. 1 problem, fix the optimization! I honestly have a pretty decent graphics card but from what ive read no matter what kind of computer you have its just not gonna work out @ 60fps. Ultra settings: NOPE! Very High: NOPE! High: NOPE! Medium: NO WTF IS THIS BS? Low: YES WTFFFFFFFF! no one really wants to play a game that utterly looks like a pile of trash, you know what i mean? Everyone says this game has poor optimization. even if you have a super computer still doesnt work? what is this B.S? all you need to need to do is update it for better fps so that no one needs a NASA computer to run this game Ultra 1080P @60fps.
4763	1	a	I give this game a 10/10 I have 400 Hours on this game 350 of those hours I've played. Other 50 hours went to AFKing. It's well worth the money becasue you can use mods on it and run different missions the re-playableity is endless. Now I only played wasteland, but there is more things like Life and stuff. Now I have played Arma: 2 Free so I know how to play the game. Only thing I don't like about it is the lack of firearms, cars, Helis, and Planes. If you look past that though it's a great game over all. It's quite social.
4765	1	a	The pre-eminent military simulator. Multi-player and the mod community are where this game shine. Incredibly deep and sometimes frustratingly buggy, persevering lends a rich experience.
4767	1	a	Absolutely love this game, a must have for everyone. 10/10 &lt;3
4769	1	a	This is the best game I've every play for 20 years.  ARMA 3 10/10  ;)
4771	1	a	If you plan to have any free time after buying Arma 3, forget it, way too addictive. Brilliant Game. Many hours spent so far, many more to come....Highly recommend this game 11/10
4773	1	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ m8 wont run on my 1987 computer my friends are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for buying a 60 dollar game thats 2 years old id rather â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my own urethra and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ back into my own â™¥â™¥â™¥. its not the worst tho.
4775	1	a	Amazing. Best game I ever saw! It's a must in the video games world!
4777	1	a	Great game if you like big maps and roleplaying as a soldier. Great variety of what you can do.
4779	1	a	Definitely worth the $60. Been playing it ever sense I bought it. 10/10 would buy again.
4781	1	a	A beautiful looking game, with realism at it's finest. Great Gunplay, and well polished campaign. Multiplayer is incredible. Tons of Mod Support through Steam Workshop, and countless support for Third Party mods like Battle Royale. It's worth the money if it's on sale, and I couldn't recommend it enough.
4783	1	a	best game ever i love it but dont buy the game if you dont hav a high end pc ;)
4785	1	a	Great game
4787	1	a	yes i recommend
4789	1	a	ARMA III is not a love hate relationship, it is a relation comprised of ruthless, and merciless defeat and frustration. This game made me pour hundreds of hours of my life, into a virtual world, where i only die. I could not recommend this more to someone who wishes to experience what it's like to be a complete failure. Playing arma, is like when you swap from COD to Battlefield, except you are being constantly reminded, that you are vulnerable. 10/10, would bearing 000000
4791	1	a	Arma 3 a very good Open world shooter and a exelent military simulator  Even that i have less then 50h in this game i would say this is a very fun game to play 9/10  9/10 becouse some bugs that can kill you  P.s - DONT GO IN WATER
4793	1	a	one of the best games ive played
4795	1	a	Alot of strategy involved in this game. I bought this game because I knew it would have great mods, and I was right. King of the hill is such a basic mod but it sure is really addictive.
4797	1	a	a must have for any milsim fan
4799	1	a	By far one of my favourite games!  I've been playing Arma since the good ol' OFP series and have truly enjoyed each new addition to the Armaverse. That being said, the game, and series, are not without its faults. Luckily the faults are often overshadowed by the large modding community which, in my opinion, is one of the best communities out there. Kudos to the devs for creating a game that encourages modding. If it's not in the game yet, you can be almost certain, that someone will mod it in.  If you like milsim, or just want to upgrade to something more tactical and realistic than the COD or BF-series, well give Arma a try. Initially the game might seem confusing, but with the introduction of Bootcamp, new players are guided through the basics of the game, and get a chance to test their skills, before taking on the full Arma experience.  A lot of players play the games single player campaign before embarking on what truly makes Arma great, the multiplayer experience. You'll find a large number of Arma groups, all looking for new members, and no matter what you prefer, be it Marines, Special Forces or Insurgents, there's bound to be a group for you too.  Some of the drawbacks about Arma 3 is, that it's set in a not to distant future, and thus the developers have chosen to 'futurefy' the units and vehicles. Some like it, some don't. In previous installations of Arma, the conflict areas somewhat resembled ongoing conflict areas in the real world, whereas in A3 the conflict initially takes place in the Mediterranean, and covers a conflict between CSAT (Iran and others) and NATO. The island of Altis does look great though, and offers plenty of space for combined warfare. If anything it lacks a bit of forest.  One of the higlights of the game, to me, is the editor. Anyone who's played with LEGO as a child will love the editor. It gives you the chance to create your own missions, and the possibilities seem endless, from the easy and short missions, to the vastly complex ones that require a good amount of scripting. Arma has it all! Plus, with Eden coming along, the editor is about to get even more awesome. A full featured 3D editor, so no more guessing if you've placed the units at the correct spot, or if they're facing the right window etc., Eden delivers big time improvements over the 'classic' 2D editor.  Now I could go on for ages with this review, but essentially here are my thoughts on the game, if you're thinking of buying it.  Buy it: - If you like to play in a more tactical manner than COD/BF - If you like being a part of a massive community, where something new is always being modded in - If you can live with some of the small errors and restrictions by the game-engine, and realizing that the game is under constant development - If you like large scale combined warfare - If you have ever played with LEGO and enjoy creating stuff - If you're looking to get into an Arma group and anjoying the MP community - If you want a game that you can play for ages  Don't buy it: - If you think it's anything like COD/BF/CS:GO - If you think you'll learn the game in 30 minutes - If you can't live with AI that sometimes is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - If you have a low spec PC (Arma is horrendously optimized, as of yet, and your FPS WILL drop)
4801	1	a	Many many mods for this game, from Epoch (like DayZ) to Paintballing and Go Karting. My personal favourite mod is wasteland, which requires no additional downloads (other than the data file which automatically downloads on joining the server). If you liked Arma 2, you will love Arma 3. The one thing I dislike nowadays, especially on Wasteland, is the the new Marksman DLC which has basically made Wasteland pay to win for those servers that allow the DLC weapons to spawn randomly in vehicles, though some don't so it isn't a HUGE issue. Â£11 for a few more guns? No thanks Bohemia, I'll stick to my trusty Mk18 and Lynx 12.7mm :D
4803	1	a	great game without bugs. 
4805	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
4807	1	a	Great game with a HUGE mod community. love it and recommend it to all my friends.
4809	1	a	*clears throat* WHY DOES IT ALWAYS SAY ITS RUNNING EVEN THOUGH I CAN PLAY OTHER STEAM GAMES *breaths deeply* FIX YOUR GAME PLEASE!!! :but i do recommend the editor mode.
4811	1	a	A really great and realistic game but do NOT buy this game if you are not patient because you will have to wait alot of time for a enemy to shoot or to get a chopper, car etc. sometimes.
4813	1	a	Great game with GREAT Modes, Everyone should buy it.   Huge maps with up to 100+ players online.  I recommend geting Battle royale mod which is a 1 vs all mode, last one standing wins the game.
4815	1	a	I was pretty good at arma 2, so I thought the arma 3 campaign was going to be fun and really easy.   Iv'e only raged quit to one game in my life That game is arma 3, I struggled through the tutorial and quit on the prologue.  Now I'm a lot better and the game is super fun!
4817	1	a	Very big step up from Arma 2, well optimised and fun to play!
4819	1	a	AWESOME GAME, MORE AWESOME mods, my Fav is A3L right now i also like Battle Royale, Breaking Point, Altis Life and Epoch, would recommend buying the Game, WORTH every Cent of it.
4821	1	a	I love this game the online suervers are full of pople to have fun with
4823	1	a	Probs the best game i have played, i really recomend trying all game modes they are soo differnt and all soo fun!
4825	1	a	Epoch. Should I say more?
4827	1	a	What needs to be said, this is Arma, the penultimate of military games. If you are looking for a military game get this one, it's based off of actual US military simulations. It can't get much better than that!
4829	1	a	Great game.
4831	1	a	Love it!
4833	1	a	After 650+ Hrs of gameplay I can thouroughly say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. The DLC for Helicopters is a little overpriced, there are some bugs that still persist occasionally but they are paled in compairison to the fantastic gameplay, realism, and fantastic community. When I say fantastic community I do mean it but be aware of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who like to hang out on the wasteland and RP servers. Other than that, it's an A++ game and I highly recommend it to all.
4835	1	a	1000000000000/10  By far one of the best games I've ever played. There is just so much you can do in this game. Wasteland, King of the hill, Invade and annex, altis life and those are just a few of the game modes not counting all the mods this game supports. And the graphics of this game are so realistic and stunning they can be compared to that of real life graphics on ultra settings. This game captures every detail of modern-somewhat futuristic warfare from the mechanics of flying a helicopter to bombing an area with mortors. And if you stuggle with flying choppers or jets or just need to practice your close quarters combat they have an editor mode which can serve as training help. This is probably my favorite game right now and i reccomend it to anyone with a good stable computer.
4837	1	a	Hours on the editor, learning from the showcases this game is truly a sandbox experience. Better interface and controls make this Arma compelling to anyone.
4839	1	a	Love it
4841	1	a	If you like a realistic military experience, this game is a must have! The Alpha release is just as good as the final release of Armed Assault and ArmA II.
4843	1	a	Thaught me how to use a grid properly, failed miserably due to lack of understanding of geometry. Education has failed me on geometry.
4845	1	a	great game, if you likfe military sim type games this is for you!
4847	1	a	first time i had ever played arma but instantly i loved the game and its interface brilliant game and lots to do its the best game for a reasonable amount of money.
4849	1	a	Gnary &lt;3
4851	1	a	My opinion about arma3:Its a very cool first person game in wich you can do a lot of stuff on multiplayer.On singeplayer tho i havent played it yet so i have no clue :D.Just buy this game if u like cars,airplanes,boats and strategics cause this game needs a lot of strategy.
4853	1	a	definitely recommend!
4855	1	a	after a few hours played I think I like this game specially because of the mods and communities.
4857	1	a	The one of the best game EVER 4EVER!!!!!
4859	1	a	Decent game, might do it again
4861	1	a	good game bought in the summer sale lots of cool mods 8/10
4863	1	a	If you've ever played and liked military shooters BUY THIS GAME NOW
4865	1	a	it does not have the best graphics, and its a bit clunky. BUT it is great fun. i strongly recommend the battle royale mod by playerunknown
4867	1	a	This is one of the best simulation game out there
4869	1	a	OKE OKE   This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome when u know how to do it. So take time when u are new and play the Bootcamp and the campaign .  For veterans its just join the battles and Multi sandbox modes in multiplayer mode.   
4871	1	a	This is a great game for anyone looking to have a hardcore realistic feel. Its customization is the best I've ever seen including everything you can think about However my only complaint is it requires a lot of power to run. My laptop met all the minimum and recommended settings except for the reccommended graphics card and I thought I would be fine. But I was very wrong because when I first launched I multiplayer I got a very unplayable 5-8 fps. Now things are a little better if I join a low populated server. I usually play KOTH and nowadays I am lucky to get anywhere near 20 fps without joining a server with less than 30 people and having the settings the lowest possible. So if you have a powerful machine I would go for it. However, if you don't have that fastest PC on the block then I wouldn't be too hasty to get this without doing some research. My final rating is 8 out of 10, but in the future maybe with some optimizaton tweeks that will change.
4873	1	a	Love this game, the variation with the various mods is great...
4875	1	a	Add me on steam if you wanna do missions I have a group.
4877	1	a	nice game, love it, the mods again make it much and much better
4879	1	a	Hello, I'm a noop, So far I'm the bootcamp is giving me a headache. I'm trying to figure out how to figure out bearings and how to should my weapon if any one would like to help it would be appreciated. Have fun   Hiker1952
4881	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game i have purchased from steam. There is such a wide varity of things to do weather its playing through the the campaign shooting at others on King of the Hill or my personal favourite Roleplaying on AltisLife. This game may have some bugs etc but still that dosnt pit of the many laughs and great memories i have had during my gameplay. During my time on Altis life i have met a great community of people who welcome all. Arma 3 is a great game and if you are negotiating weather to buy it or not i would defonitly say Purchase this game 10/10
4883	1	a	nice game and hella lot of mods to p[ay there be a mod for everyone and anyone
192	0	a	it dosent let me play i when i get on it says no entry? 
4885	1	a	This game is Mad. Best Army simulator thing ive tried 
4887	1	a	Its ok.
4889	1	a	It's OK I guess......
4891	1	a	A really good game that can get boring at times but over all id give it a 10/10 !!!!!!
4893	1	a	pretty cool geam wit sum hardcore military type peeple that take gaem way 2 srsly. very fun 2 like screw around in n stuff. combat is fun an u can pretend u r like a cool kid soldir fiting in a war wit utter solders. r8 laggy n â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if u dun have mega awesome cumpooter lik3 me.

Since vilence n stuff in da game is not so gewd for the yungins.
4895	1	a	Great Game - Love it
4897	1	a	Without A doubt my favorite computer game to play as of now.  TLDR: If you are under the age of 16, Don't buy this game, You will not have the paitence for it and most likely get extremely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off that you won't be able to hit an enemy from 15 yards away.  The Multiplayer has SO, SO many games modes, my favorite being Alits life, and the way you can mod all types of different vehicles into alits life.   Like all other games ARMA has it's problems, but they are too small for me to really explain to any potential buyers. This game is a MUST HAVE without a doubt.
4899	1	a	Amazing title with amzing graphics. The difference between this and Arma 2 whilch i also owned is unbeleivable. New features include the option to attack from water with scuba divers, 230km open world with most buildings enterable a definate must buy for any FPS fan.
4901	1	a	its worth a try :D
4903	1	a	arma 3 is the best
4905	1	a	10/10
4907	1	a	When you buy this game you must know that you are robbing Bohemia Interactive of their Money. It should be worth more than it is priced out to be.
4909	1	a	10/10 Would play forever
4911	1	a	I love this game :)
4913	1	a	This game is one of the best ive played its got ... let me think cause theres a lot. lots of online game modes map editor realistic things um yea its just fun over all. I recommend this game also yes it does have ZUEZ!!!!
4915	1	a	Fun game and many different game modes. WARNING: BEFORE BUYING Make sure your Computer/Laptop have the right specs for running this game.
4917	1	a	Not your Grandaddys Call of Duty.
4919	1	a	Military simulator with a steep learning curve. By far the most realistic shooter ever made. I love the game, but it is no run and gun BF game.
4921	1	a	I am a huge shooter fan. You name it and I have played it....from CS 1.6 to HALO to Advanced Warfare. The ARMA series has always been one of my favorite. There truely is nothing else like it. Played with the right group of people in a co-op server and next thing you know 4 hours have gone by. I love this game.
4923	1	a	When playing singleplayer the game runs as it should on your average gaming rig, however when playing on multiplayer server even the most powerful machine can struggle running this game well.  On an i7 with a 980Ti, while playing KOTH on high settings I get an average of 25-40 FPS, though on other servers I can play on Ultra with 60 FPS; so it varies.  The gameplay itself is enjoyable, there are many game modes for you to choose from and I can easily see anyone buying this game getting at least 500 hours out of it.
4925	1	a	The default stuff isn't the best, but with mods this game is awesome.
4927	1	a	A great shooter and combat game. Unlike Call of Duty and Battlefield, they do not need to release a new one every year.
4929	1	a	The long awaited sequel to ArmA 2 is finally here! It brings what made the previous titles great into a modern military shooter with more features than you could possibly mention in a short review. Worth full retail price and a must buy when on sale.
4931	1	a	Its hard on noobs. It was for me. But as soon as i found out the basics i had so much fun!
4933	1	a	Best game ever, can't get enough of it. With all the mods and missions for this game it has endless potential and opportunities. Must have for shooter fans.
4935	1	a	for the ppl who are tired of cod and bf because this is 66x better than both of them if you have a good computer to run it. 10.5/10 amzinggg 
4937	1	a	so much to offer. a must get if into simulation what so ever.
4939	1	a	Honestly I dont know why you are reading reviews. Buy the game. There is soooooo much you can do with this. Everything from wasteland servers to Epoch to Altis life. It can be a zombie game. Or it can be a Mil sim. It can be a non broken form of GTA. Or it could be a racing game.  Only con is you have to pay for DLC. The content in the DLC should have already been included -_-
4941	1	a	Absolultly love this game 10/10. The moding aspect is awsome, if you want to add some real units and some different maps it makes the game just that much more realistic. would highly recommend.
4943	1	a	Best Game in my library, alot of people wont like this game cause it isnt easy like CoD or Battlefield, well they need to learn what strategy is and Skill and simulation. because this is top of the line!
4945	1	a	I have had Arma III for about a year now, and really engoy the game. The graphics, and overall gameplay is amazing and well done. I do suggest you have a higher end computer to play this game though, or play on low settings. I would suggest this game.
4947	1	a	Got this game, installed a mod didnt work loaded the campain and got killed by a pterodactyl 9/11 IGN Like down's syndrome sheep on heroin.
4949	1	a	The only problem with arma 3 is... the lack of content. The arma 2 had such a great community and mods and even the game had more guns and armor at the start than arma 3. I just can't understand why devs did not put in stuff like bipods, advanced first aid, helicopter features, portable MG's, and on and on, that arma 2 had. So if you buy arma 3 you get a bit more 'polished' arma, but with the lack of good multiplayer servers and simplicity in game experience. So if you are new to the arma 3 its fine you wont even know what im talking about and go ahead its a great game. But if you were a fan of arma 2 like me, you will just be dissapointed, about the multiplayer content and community pick. And Bohemia Interactive seems to like EA principles of marketing game. Its hilarious that they are trowing out DLC's that enable you so basic thing as a rope hook on a helicopter for 15$! Which it should have already be in the game?! So the final tought is still, a good game but the devs â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up big time. 6.5/10 So wake up Bohemia and stop being so lazy and dull to the fan base. And if you have to rip people off with DLC's put at least a fair price of 5$ instead of 15$.
4951	1	a	Great Game. It is not a 'just shoot' shooter, no this game has some very advanced mechanisms which bring this game up to a new stage of depth. Certainly worth the money
4953	1	a	Extremely frustrating at times but well worth the buy.
4955	1	a	Best damn game out there. Just get it. Now.
4957	1	a	Ah where to begin with ARMA 3....   I had just landed on a beach in a rubber boat with my four man team. We are assaulting enemy positions to capture intel and eliminate a HVT. Soon after landing, we are ambushed by an enemy assault boat that promply decimates my team. I manage to land a rocket hit on the boat and incapacitate its crew before it can annihilate me. With the boat disabled, I am now on my own. Do I continue the mission by myself, or do I abort and let my team die for nothing? I choose to continue, using a silenced weapon to help conceal my position. I call for friendly reinforcments to begin the assault on the town. A convoy with friendly troops starts coming down the road. Suddenly, rockets from a hilltop position begin to rain down on the convoy, disabling several vehicles. Everyone dismounts and begins engaging the enemy on the hilltop. I use the distraction to flank the enemy position and eliminate the fireteam. We proceed towards the town, eliminating small pockets of resistance along the way. Suddenly we are pinned down by enemy machinegun fire that kills several friendlies. I call in an airstrike that levels the houses containing the position, eliminating the threat along with the HVT. I then see a target of opportunity: an enemy cargo truck. I align my sights slightly above the target to compensate for the distance and fire. The truck erupts into flames. This came at a price, as my postion was compromised and drew heavy enemy fire towards my position. We have no choice but to engage. After several bloody minutes, four enemy fireteams lay dead on the battlefield with only light casualties on our side. I decide this is the moment to assault the position containing the intel. I successfully acquire the intel and call in an evac chopper to extract me to a safe position. We extract under fire and secure the intel, dealing a severe blow to the enemy.  10/10
4959	1	a	it is a amazing game butt it has sum hikups 
4961	1	a	I really enjoyed this game i love of the possiable missions the easy editor the amazing story line the only part i dont like about this game is the fact that i have to pay another 32 dollars for marksman dlc and helicopters dlc which should just be a part of the game where i dont need to pay another 16 dollars just to be a sniper as i loved to be on arma 2 i do highly reccomend this game its a must play
4963	1	a	Comparing Arma 2 to Arma 3. Arma 2 has more content, but Arma 3 has more features. Once it has all the content it will be fantastic
4965	1	a	Arma 3, Where do i start?  Overall, A great game! Allthough the optimization is not too great, the mod support on this game is amazing, The campaign somehow makes sense and comes together, The new Go-Kart DLC is also great aswell!  
4967	1	a	This is probley the best game iv played. Good graphics and realisme!
4969	1	a	11/10 I once got into a fight with a cow could not defeat him 2 strong 4 mi!
4971	1	a	this game is the best
4973	1	a	Great servers to play on, but it is not optimized very well.
4975	1	a	7.5/10, not really a sim but it's pretty well made and there's a huge community.
4977	1	a	Great game I have had many hours of fun. One of the best military (if not the best) i have played.
4979	1	a	Even though it's not as optimized as it could be this game is an absolute gem. I remember that scene from Black Hawk Down where they call in a chopper, throw a IR grenade on the roof and the chopper comes in to save the day. i experienced that on a normal public server and that is the thing about Arma. whether you're in to competitive pvp, survival mods, usergenerated singleplayer missions or HUGE COOP operations, this game's got it 10/10
4981	1	a	this games is awesome, just the amount of stuff you can do because of all the diffrent mods and game modes there are. if you like first person shooters this is the one you should get.
4983	1	a	This is the most realistic game I have ever played. Controls are hard to adjust to but if you like military simulators you will love this game 10.5/10
4985	1	a	Good game Nice to kill all the time
4987	1	a	Great fun if you like role playing, or if you love realistic combat.
4989	1	a	so fun, so many mods, this game is awesome.
4991	1	a	Really awesome game, i give it a 10/10 for gameplay. There are still many issues with this game though. You constantly fall through stairs and break your legs randomly. You just have to be really careful with stairs.
4993	1	a	Goodbye fps.
4995	1	a	Highly suggest getting this game. I found it highly addictive, and love making new missions. Also if you dont have a decent PC dont bother, Arma 3 is best at its full quality and i couldn't stand playing it when my old computer couldn't handle it.
4997	1	a	i shoot stuff 10/10 
4999	1	a	If someone is looking for a military shooter where they want:  1. To make their own Campaigns 2. Experience Realism as well as absurdity 3. Mod Support 4. Replay Value  This game is for you.
5001	1	a	This is a very awesome game. It should be called military simmulator because it is very realistic. Also it is a very demanding game on your hardware, Loved it. I will buy it in the next few weeks.
5003	1	a	Action packed game. (it Works best when you are in a comunity) Come joing  IGGHQ.com  TS:  eu.igghq.com 
5005	1	a	Great game to play, Strongly suggested to play with a clan for best experience
5007	1	a	Its a great game, buy it
5009	1	a	Hello,  Let me start this out by saying I myself have played 1,372 hours of this game from the date of this review. ArmA 3 or Armed Assault 3, is a sandbox military simulation. ArmA 3 has a variety of game-modes ranging from Invade and Annex (A more objective based team oriented game-mode) Altis Life (A game-mode that is basically, well... life, you can buy cars, houses, boats, guns, etc. You can have many jobs such as, Police Officer, Rebel, Drug Lord, or anything of your imagination really.) Wasteland (A more survival based game-mode where you can team up with friends or other players to survive, complete objectives, earn money, kills others, and buy equipment) Along with a variety of other modded gamemodes ranging from, Milsim type game-modes, to more casual game-modes. If you are into any sort of military simulation, survival, or roleplaying type games, you should definently give ArmA 3 a shot, especially with the new Steam refund policy, so you can try it for up to 2 hours and if you like it, keep it. Now, is it worth the $60 dollars? For me it is well worth your $60, as I got a lot more out of this game than any normal priced $60 game. Now for the DLC, that is totally up to you, as you can play on any server, and even ride and even sometimes pick up the DLC content, it does not separate the community at all. Though, depending on your system hardware the game may be very hard to run, though with some tweaks found in forums and videos, it can improve your framerate by a lot. To sum it up, ArmA 3 is a great game for what is it.  - TooSpooky
5011	1	a	Excellent and fun game that gives you a lot of fun and options for the price. However, the engine is rather poor making catching as stable framerate, or even a decent one can be difficult sometimes even with some fairly high end rigs.
5013	1	a	just noticed i had never written a comment down here so let's write.  so i'll good points bad points.  good ones:  It's an arma game. It was made by bohemia interactive. there are guns. God damn CHOPPERS Dev care about the community The community is freaking good, well... most of the time DLC don't penalyze anyone and the features of these are free  Dev still add new things (for instance DLC marksmen tomorrow adding working bipods, resting on objects, new guns and all this kind of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥), they're currently working on a new map, they'll surely add many unknown things.  The freacking mods, i mean in this game if you want a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing private jet riding a horse with a sword there's probably someone who made it and if not you can do it yourself (it's a long â™¥â™¥â™¥ work but you can).  now bad points:  Physics you make a vehicle explode by driving 3mph towards a rock but you won't explode if you make a 180 landing on a spruce tree from a god damn ac-130 which comes from a mod...  Some people in the community especially the ones who complains about DLC's that add free content..  Not enough planes, there are several choppers civilians and military but there are only fighter jets and drones as fixed-wings.  And finally hellicopter advanced physics which is some kind of weird crossing between the arma 3 style and some kind of reallistic but not too much physics, i find it pretty weird but meh..   So buy this game, this was an order ;)
5015	1	a	An impressively complex and yet easy to enjoy military sim game...you can spend your time designing massive battles and engagements or flying around as a helicopter pilot...or covertly leading a squad behind enemy lines....or directing mortar fire....a really great game.
5017	1	a	Its alright yeah.
5019	1	a	An amazing game. Was able to play it free for a weekend. Had so much fun! Anyone who can afford it should get it IMMEDIATELY
5021	1	a	Amazing game, great community. It can be modded easily allowing wide access to user-made content.   DLC isn't mandatory unlike a lot of games, and there is frequent free updates adding new features.  Well worth the money that it's being sold for.
5023	1	a	Great tactical shooter/sim . The game needs more team on team . Im not a big fan of playing AI .
5025	1	a	If you played Arma 2 and loved it there is a solid chance you will love arma 3. They are two games that have so much in common but Arma 3 offers new and unique features all at the same time.
5027	1	a	Everything I expected over the years of not having a PC strong enough to handle this has now come to light and it is everything that I expected. Nothing more..
5029	1	a	Fun milsim with great comunity servers and gamemodes
5031	1	a	Finally a game thats actully realistic not like cod or battlefeild this game is fun to play the game has a variety of cars planes helis boats subs cars tanks and trucks if you like shooters but like realism i will recommed this game
5033	1	a	9,5/10 great graphics and gameplay. buy this game if you want to: -make your own mission -be a solider -be a pilot -be a tank crew -be a civilian with a better life then you :P -die of mines -want to move from bf 4/3/hardline -love teamwork  if any of them over match what you want/do buy this game
5035	1	a	After the 523 hr I have played arma 3 I have meet new friends I have joined and made groups and had some epic battles, Its an amazing game, every thing is at it best in Arma 3, the pyhisics, combat movments, wepons and many more!  10/10
5037	1	a	A must to have if you like combat simulation. To increase even more the immersion i also suggest to install mods like ACE3 or Task Force Radio
5039	1	a	I love this game so much. The only downside that I have about it is when I join up on an Altis Life server, a lot of the police will just shoot you on site without you doing anything illegal. There are other servers though that the police are actually amazing and will role play well with you as long as you are not rude to them. Overall it's an amazing game and I love it so much.
5041	1	a	this is a great game
5043	1	a	Real Life Cartel 10/10 Would scream Allau Akhbar again
5045	1	a	Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dope, if you have a community like me to play with!
5047	1	a	Superb quality military simulator. 10/10
5049	1	a	Looks fun...to bad I just played for a little bit
5051	1	a	Get this game if you don't have nor want a life.  :'-)
5053	1	a	I have played arma 3 for a while now and feel like I should give it a review.  Arma 3 is basically THE war SIMULATOR! If you are looking for some awesome realistic wars, you have found your game. There are A LOT of gamemodes online, each on is different. The amount of mods and user created content for the game is insane. You can create your OWN missions and play the with your friends or share them on the workshop.  There is only one HUGE drawback to this game. Due to it looking so good, you will need a GOOD pc. That's the only the biggest issue I came across.   The interface is one of the things I think could be different but I dont know how. Mabey with the use of a some sort 'action key' could make it a bit less gimmecky.  Afterall I would totally recommend this game but DONT expect it to be anywhere like cod or bf. Its totally diffrent.  Worth the price I paid with the summer sales! :D
5055	1	a	Great game. Love it !!!
5057	1	a	Great Game!
5059	1	a	Do you like milsim? Do you like steep learning curve? Then this is the game for you. pew pew
5061	1	a	This game is very fun! Both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. However, it depends on what server you find, you may find a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one at first and rethink the choice you made about buying this game. Or you can find an AMAZING server and absolutely fall in love with the game. If you find one of those bad servers, keep searching! You can find that one server that is fit for you! Best Army Sim you can find out there! This game is a BIG $60 but trust me, it is worth $100!
5063	1	a	I just think this game is the defenition of best gunplay in arma. It has a mixture of realistic gun actions and (if you like to ruin the game) you can flay it like a twitch shooter.
5065	1	a	Well, having clocked nearly 1300hrs on this game, I have a great idea of what this game can and cannot provide to what a player would expect to find inside. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a team based game, if you run solo, you will most likely end up dead very soon. This is nothing like the Battlefield series or CoD. Arma 3 is it's own type of game. It takes hours to march from one end of the larger map, Altis, to the other. The vanilla Arma 3 is good as it is, but the sheer volume of mods and community created content will ensure you almost never get bored of it. Arma can provide everything from small 2-5 man squad insurgency operations, to 100+ player all out war, to post-apocalyptic survival in the Breaking Point mod. This game is, however, not without its bugs; take for example when I tried flipping an MRAP with a tank, only to have my tank launch in the air 300m and kill me when it landed. But good and bad combined, this is by far the best game I've played in a VERY long while. 10/10 would recommend.
5067	1	a	Arma 3 has got to be the greatest open worls fps/Third person shooter on steam. It's combat is realistic and satisfying, especially in vehicle like jets because of its challenging but rewarding flight model. This game also has a brilliant modding communtiy and it keeps the game fresh and excititng. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has interest in fps/ third person open worls games.
5069	1	a	Arma 3 is a very intense and beautiful game. If you've ever played arma 1 or arma 2 you would know that it is a huge game, from its single player campaigns to multiplayer modes and the community with their custom missions, scripts and mods. This game offers the player a good fountadion to a war-sim game, especially if you're playing with people and even better with a clan. All u can say is if you like war games and into simulators you'll definatly like Arma!
5071	1	a	I find the controls a little complex and weird. Only get 30 fps ;-; but graphics are beautiful  In terms of actual gameplay I don't really know what to say yet (20+ hours when writing this reiew) It takes a lot of patience though
5073	1	a	Very Good and Fun Game
5075	1	a	Very nice, fixed what ARMA 2 had problems with. Still has some small problems. -Physics -FPS -Lag But really? Its Arma, get over it. 
5077	1	a	My hours in game alone should say enough.
5079	1	a	IT IS AN AWESOME GAME I WOULD KILL FOR IT
5081	1	a	Best Game In The World
5083	1	a	Arma III takes a very realistic approach to military shooters, which leads to having the player formulate advanced tactics and communicate with his allies to execute said tactics. Shooting mechanics feel great and different from what players are used to. Player movement is rigid and limited, just like a person's would be, although these restrictions can be annoying at times. The way Bohemia Interactive managed DLC for this game is also absolutely amazing, since their strategy doesn't divide the player-base and still earns them profit. The only downside I find is how unpolished it feels. There are numerous visual glitches, the game runs like crap on most devices and the animations are a bit hard to look at. It's overall a fantastic game/simulator, but it desperately needs more visual polish. 9/10
5085	1	a	What a fantastic game!   The gameplay is fantastic and the variety of things to do is amazing. The graphics are stunning however it is more difficult to run at a higher FPS than other games (because there are lots of things going on at the same time). The maps are huge, especially Atlis, and there are many ways to get around.  However, the 'lagginess' depends a lot on the server you are in and your latency so it sometimes takes a while to find a good server, it is best to find one in the same country as you are.  I would totally recommend this game! 9/10
5087	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time you can build bases play campaign multiplayer all that good stuff i recommend!
5089	1	a	Best game ever.. hands down the most realistic first and third person shooter ive ever played, just get it.
5091	1	a	great game and would recomend  
5093	1	a	I would totally recommend this game for those who have the money :P
5095	1	a	My computer is in the 99th percentile on 3Dmark and this game still lags.  10/10
5097	1	a	Great game and wouldn't swap it for any other and I got a great community to back me up on that
5099	1	a	When I got this game I thought it wasnt going to be that great and figured it would be one of those games that I play if I can not think of anything else to play. But now, I am 700 hours in and I still play it almost every day. That being said, I highly recommend this game. There is a lot of different things you can do in it like, wasteland, roleplay stuff and many other game modes. There is also a lot of mods out there that make the game completley different and make it even more enjoyable. The game is very CPU intensive though so make sure you have a good cpu and a decent graphics card and the game will run fine, most of the time anyways.
5101	1	a	tacticool dogs need to be added 90/1 
5103	1	a	I probably spend more time finding and downloading mods than playing.
5105	1	a	possibly the greatest game ever made....  
5107	1	a	This game is amazing, now im kinda late to the reveiw cause I have almost 2k hours but the game is really good and the modder community makes it even better
5109	1	a	plays wasteland server for 3 days straight and has every gun, armor piece and driveable piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in game. goes on next day to find its all been stolen. 10/10 would buy new break hand destroying moniter again
5111	1	a	If you want some thrill and reality frustration along with good graphics,this is your war game. Good luck avoiding those bullets flying over your head. Teamwork is a must  If there is a (-) here for me is that you really need patience and hours to master the controls in order to enjoy it.
5113	1	a	Damn is this a fun game. I love ARMA 3. While it still has a few iffy features from ARMA 2 like the all terrible context menu, this game is a gift that keeps on giving. If you like mission making, this game has one of the best mission makers I have ever seen. If you like tactical shooters, this is one of the best. Get together with some friends or randoms and do military like operations. Or maybe you like a more casual shooter, this has that too. With modes like King of the Hill or just plain deathmatch, you can play it just like a shooter, albeit way more fun. With modes like Zeus you can make missions easily on the fly with friends and have great fun. I really recommend this game as it has given me many hours of entertainment.
5115	1	a	Probably the most realistic game out there, Well most of the time... great for hours of fun. I have played Arma since Arma 2 free.
5117	1	a	one of the best shooters out there and very realistic, an outstanding game.
5119	1	a	sunk way to many hours in to this and still yet to get board
5121	1	a	Arma 3... a briliant simulator! A finely made game and detail is top notch. The game is amazing to play with friends and just members of the community, good communities are rare to come across but Arma has always delivered a fun experience balancing realism with fun aswell.
5123	1	a	This game looks great and its all you need in a millitary game now a days so i might buy it
5125	1	a	After many months of waiting we all have finally a good product in line with others arma serie sims....i can say without hairs on toungue...yes...it's a game to purchase absolutely because it's the only simulation that give to all players who want some in more about realism and gameplay.Can be a bit frustrating at start cause it's a sim and not a game but anyway you can also set it as a game ....more easy as you want .It is a sim settable really as you desire in all aspects...so...now there is nomore excuses for to say i wait a bit for to have it Finally the second island of the game called Altis it's a capolavour of design ...go to check there all the hundreds of things into Altis map and you ll see the delicious attention for the more fine details.The AI is improved as sound 3D and in general all you did like into arma serie is here in more detailed graphic and sound with a new engine.
5127	1	a	It's like Arma 2 but the 3'rd one
5129	1	a	Arma 3 is a very good first/third person war simulator that successfully simulates what is actually like to fight in battles. And lets say you getting bored with some of the standared war scenarios then you can easily download a mod off of workshop and play that instead. Arma 3 is defintely for you if your looking for a fun game that really captures good gun play and enhanced environments.
5131	1	a	Great Game. Even better with friends. Best experience.
5133	1	a	Ä°t's a good RPG game.
5135	1	a	I have spent a good amount of time in this game, both singleplayer and multiplayer. And I have to say, this game can literally become any game you want. = Obviously, Arma 3 is built for epic tactical action gameplay. The base game involves around military atmosphere: tanks, attack jets, attack boats, armored cars, soldiers and helicopters; all of those can be accessed right away after you purchase the game and install it. = The game has many complicated systems and machanics, such as, commanding the AIs (it's a real pain in the butt), seats in vehicles, stances, movements, interaction menu, etc. This is why many new players feel disencouraged and quit playing the game. But if you are a tough gamer and able to deal with difficulties, then this game might be for you. = As I said earlier, you can experience this game in unlimited number of ways, with or without mods. Mods play a big role in the game, but I will say about that later. = Without mods, the player can still join several multiplayer servers, both PVP and PVE, which has different gamemodes too. But if you want to play singleplayer, this game can serves you well too. = Singleplayer in this game has 3 forms: campaign, scenarios, and editor. -Campaign is pretty much self-explainatory. You play as a soldier on the island with your fellow army teammates and go on an adventure with wide-open levels and a simple set of story. You can play the original Arma 3 base game's campaign or the ones you download from Steamworkshop (or others) which are user-created and some of them are really enjoyable to try out. -Scenarios are short Arma 3 missions that, usually, made by Arma 3 players and can be downloaded from the Steamworkshop (or other Arma 3 community websites) Some of them are really enjoyable like custom campaigns. -Editor is a very powerful tool in Arma 3. In this mode, you can create your own mission in any style you like. as long as you know how to do it. I suggest going through the Arma 3 editor guides and Arma 3 community websites to learn more about the editor. = MODS Mods are the wheels that keep this game running. There are countless of them and a lot of them can improve your overall experience in the game, some can change the game completely. For example, the mod 'Altis Life' is a multiplayer total conversion mod. It features the role-playing multiplayer experience, from normal civilians to police forces and outlaws. Therefore, even if you prefer a role-playing multiplayer game, you can play this game, just with mods. But if you are here to be a soldier on the battlefield fighting bad guys with fellow soldiers, you also have a lot of windows for modding. Weapon mods, vehicle mods, faction mods, etc. can be downloaded via Steamworkshop (and other websites) to add unlimited variety of reallistic content to the game. = MilSim MilSim stands for Military Simulation which, in the context of this game, is a style of gameplay that involves around serious and reallistic gameplay. Every player will act like a real life soldier and work together as a team. Usually, MilSim servers have mods to make the game more challenging and reallistic and admins of the servers or the head of the army will only pick players who are old enough and can play appropriately in their servers. So far, MilSim gameplay is the most accurate experience that Arma 3 is trying to offer to the players. = Thank you for reading the review. I have to manage all the mods and watch some editor tutorials.
5137	1	a	Great game with a good story. Big community support means there are a lot of mods out there to use and get even more hours out of the game 10/10
5139	1	a	Outstanding game. A must have!
5141	1	a	A great game with lots of potential. I love the combat, vehicles and customization goes as far as your heart's content. With the open world maps there are almost countless places to fight. The A3Launcher is a must-have if you want to go past the limits of the default game. It will give more content and new servers to play on.   The community varies alot. There are so many different types of players on this game. It'd be a lie if I said the community's great. Honestly it needs some major working on. There are some players on this game who are helpful and more friendly and there's some who can be rude and oblivious. It may be different for other players who experience with otherpeople. But this is just my opinion.  The gameplay adjusts to your environment. You must use it to your advantage, if you don't you'll probably end up dieing. If your on a team based gamemodes like king of the hill and invade &amp; innex and for example; Your in a car and driving down the main road with passangers and the main road is guarded by tanks and infantry. You should probably go around the main road onto a side road to lower the chances of you and your teammates dieing.  Overall, I would give this game a 7.5 / 10. 
5143	1	a	Arma III is a combat simulator like no other simulator I've played. I like the deep mental involvement. Very immersive game.
5145	1	a	Do drugs, not Arma. You can thank me later.
5147	1	a	This is simply the best simulation game ever and is very realistic. There are several amazing aspects of Arma 3 including the graphics they are amazing at max settings it is just so impressive. The gameplay nails the realism but dosen't get too frustrating and the sheer level of interactivity is staggering. The scale is another defining aspect of Arma the huge map really is impressive and anything can happen from small pistol firefights to tank battles. Modding is siply amazing with this game it's easy to mod and installing them are quite easy too. Really good stuff but it is very intensive on ur system
5149	1	a	I guess bohemia thought human eyes are 15 fps
5151	1	a	id have to say this is money well spent
5153	1	a	Arma3 Is a must buy. Period.
5155	1	a	In a lot of games I like the idea of teamplay and tactical combat. Usually though it's just fun and not functional. With just 18 hours played I can already tell that in this game that is not the case. Teamplay and command structures are necessary, and rewarding; I found myself giving medivac extraction, flying an A10, surviving solo in a harsh environment and so on.  The game does come with some of the problems inherent to the arma series, with some slightly off animations, and clunky controls (you get used to them). Of course if you're not a fan of hardcore shooters, this is no Call of Duty: it's not easy or forgiving, although there are a huge variety of gamemodes, with some harder than others.  Despite its problems the game is definitely worth buying, this is what I've been looking for for a long time.
5157	1	a	I love Arma 3. Not only the game but the vast communities for this game. modded or not the game is fun and challenging.
5159	1	a	bought this to play one of the best millatary simulators and get the experience of being a man on the front line. i instead played arma life where i was robbed by two men wearing nothing, became a pimp and even started my own fight club damn broke the 1st rule.  11/10  would pimp again
5161	1	a	great when playing with friends or on a server with other people but can get boring when you are just playing by yourself.
5163	1	a	This is the most realistic Modern military game to date. the game is abit expencive at the moment, but what ever right? Arma 3 has Awesome graphic, kinda buggy at times, but it's constantly being updated. There are alot of diffrent types of servers, RPlife types, Realistic military, inde. type of military operations, wastland i.e survival w/ a group of friends or a team of random, and it's all %100 free roam. The singleplayer isnt perfect, but it's OK, although, it keeps reseting my progress, so I didnt try to complete it, But it's one of the best games I've ever played, it if you think it's boring, play with some friends, it is WAY better with friends.    P.S dont buy the DLC, not worth the money, just play on modded servers, or get mods
5165	1	a	Perfect !
5167	1	a	You can be a rabbit 10/10
5169	1	a	I really like it. Htere are a ton of diffrent mods and things to do.
5171	1	a	10/10
5173	1	a	â”œHonest Reviewâ”¤ Review is based on current state of game.  Game Pros â€¢ Open World â€¢ Mod Support â€¢ Multiplayer â€¢ Realistic Mechanics â€¢ Vehicles (Air and Ground) â€¢ Day/Night Cycle â€¢ Weather System â€¢ Frequent updates  Game Cons â€¢ FPS is spotty (Depending on server and your computer specs) â€¢ Server list has trouble loading sometimes  Relateable Games â€¢ N/A  Conclusion ArmA III is a fantastic and realistic war simulation game. With a ton of mod support and game modes, you will surely get a ton of hours of enjoyment in this game.  (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)
5175	1	a	i played this game when it was free and it was great
5177	1	a	8.66666666/10, cause my well trained sniper can't hold his breath.
5179	1	a	  I jumped off a roof when I couldn't run this on my old computer...
5181	1	a	A great Milsim , mod friendly shooter that has depth and plenty of gameplay variety .
5183	1	a	Very fun lots to do and is a great experience
5185	1	a	Brilliant game when you can find the right server with level headed people.
5187	1	a	Love This Game Soo Much &lt;3
5189	1	a	PROS  This is a very indepth game for thos who love role play, and the adrenaline rush of battle that comes from an lmg supressing you behind that one rock. The feeling that one bullet can literally take your life a way, a commanding a squad or even an army, with a rich modding community to keep your interest peaked this is a very fun game.  CONS  Now i cant stress enough, this is no console game, no call of duty, no battle field. A well thought out but sloppily put togetehr Battle simulator. You will find yourself forgetting the controls unless you play faithfully everyday. You will be imersed in this game but trust me you will know its a game, you cant evem jump in this game but i t didnt stop my purchase.  Its awe inspiring and overall a very good game where they lack in proper control scheme and polish they make up for with dumping content and realism in your face.
5191	1	a	good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tttt
5193	1	a	This game is really what you make of it (the mods you play, the people you play with). The groundwork has been layed, the maps, the models, the netcode (...still pretty bad lol). You have to find the gamemode that you can get into and only then you really understand what arma offers. The entertainment from this game is a rollercoaster, no scenario you encounter is ever the same.  And no, buying a $4000 computer will not improve your fps in multiplayer...
5195	1	a	I have several hours in this game. My friends got me into it a bit after it released, and although I'm not the best this game is always fun. I love playing the mods like Epoch and Exile.  This game is a must have for all gamers. You can really benchmark your machine with it. So photo realistic even on the medium settings.
5197	1	a	It's an amazing game. The campaign wasnot boring at all and some Co-ops are challaning and fun. But it needs massive PVP official mods/games , more complex maps(or objects) and official co-ops which is as good as the campaign.
5199	1	a	Generally a good game but I wouldnt play it for the campaigjn, For me its just a fun game about city life (not military)
5201	1	a	look at my hours tho +1
5203	1	a	My name is Dry, and i approve of this game. :P
5205	1	a	This game makes me and my cpu feel useless.  11/10
5207	1	a	It's only in Alpha and it still walks, fly's, drive's and dive's all over all the tunnel shooters!  A real improvement over Arma 2 which i loved for all it's faults. Get it, try it now!
5209	1	a	Must be one of the best experiences of my life. If it wasn't for this free weekend i wouldnt have found it and i wouldnt have played it so thank you Bohemi &lt;3 You made the best 3 days of my life and now im off to buy the bloody game because i think im addicted.. i only buy games im addicted to, Thank you from the bottom of my hearth.
5211	1	a	Arma... that is a soldier and one life, lots of helicopters, tanks and other things
5213	1	a	Played a bit, really enjoyed it.
5215	1	a	There is so much to do in this game it's insane. I would go so far as to say that it's an adult Garry's mod due to all the different possibilities with Arma. Every gametype, every mod has a community to go with it. You get so engrossed into any good server you could easily invest 50+ hours in one week when find something new. You can play at least 100-200 hours of Battle Royale easily, or maybe 50-250+ on invade and annex (depending on how hardcore you are). Maybe king of the hill is more of your thing? Go play 300 hours of that in a week. Or possibly you want a better DayZ than the standalone? Go spend 600+ hours roaming a single map looking for loot and building up your base, +more hours for every map. You like little kids screaming at you because theyre a cop and are immune to the rules? Waste your life away playing any of the life mods.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg, and I think this is the perfect example of that saying.  There is just so much to enjoy about ARMA3. It's a lot more user friendly than previous titles and is much improved from previous titles as well... didn't substanially change anything so veterans of the franchise will miss it, but rather they worked on it and added more. Nothing about this game did they mess up making the previous ones better, it's still ARMA.  It may be a little hard to learn at first, as the IGN review gives it a 7/10 because the reviewer simply did not give it enough time to learn it, but it all pays off. Once you learn to think like a member of something bigger than you, or even that youre bigger than a group, and learn how to manage everything, you'll be having a blast.   THE LEARNING CURVE IS WORTH IT!!!    When you find games with people who have thousands of hours on it (ie CSGO, SKYRIM, ARMA...) you know it's a good game, why else would anyone spend 1000+ hours of their life playing something? Because they think it's okay? NO, because they love it.      TL:DR Just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy it already you pleb    
5217	1	a	Arma is a is an amazing game the multiplayer is filled with fun and outstanding and unlimited options. On the other hand the story is not as great as expected but still the multiplayer defently devilers. I rate this gate 5 out of 5 stars due to the comnplex and outstanding multiplayer.
5219	1	a	If you are into the arma series I'd say give this one a try it's much more in depth and a bit more on the graphics than the rest so you will need a computer that's roughly 2012 or later or you will lag a lot even on low graphics. Solid gameplay and it is pretty fun with friends.
5221	1	a	Anyone into Realistic FPS, this is the game for you. You can add mods to make it more realistic than it already is and you can find a lot of clans/squads who do real training like you're in the military.
5223	1	a	Best military sim on the market, and it's not even close.
5225	1	a	This game is really fun to play with friends! I enjoy all the realistic aspects of the game. It is also one of the best sandbox games I ever have played :)  10/10 would play again
5227	1	a	Great game!!
5229	1	a	The best game I have ever played , its just so addicting &amp; emersive , the game may run bad but for all the content you get &amp; map size its hella worth it , but for me the game runs decent as I have an Intel proccessor . The graphics today still look good , and the zues editor is the best part in my opinion as you can create random events while playing with your friends which adds a whole new feel to arma , look I can go on &amp; on about how good this game is , but here is a 10/10 arma , u deserve it :)
5231	1	a	*WARNING* Before even considering this game, ensure you have a powerful pc. I can barely run 40 fps on medium with an i7 4770, 16gb ram and an oc HD7950.   Simple review:  Pros: -Environment is amazing -Gameplay is extremely realistic (expect one shot kills from an AR)  -Srategy must be utilised to gain results -The addition of the workshop is what really makes it shine (mods, scenarios, weapon addons and much more!)  -Interesting missions, gamemodes and campaign is decent -The difficulty of the game makes it highly rewarding (subjective)  -Mechanics is great, from the physics to the UI -A ton of vehicles to learn to use, if you run out just go to the workshop -DEFINITELY NOT a fast pace game like COD or BF (subjective)  -I can be here all day listing out the pros as there are so many features   Cons: -Takes a while to get into, especially if you haven't played previous Arma games -Frustration and rage is common (especially on hard missions) (subjective)  -UI can be a bit complicated at first and takes getting used to -Large game, especially with addons (shouldn't be much of a problem)  -Gameplay takes a long time to adapt to and learning to fly planes and helis well takes ages  Proper review: This game is probably one of the best military game I have ever played. It is far different to your average fps and aims for realism. This means it is not suitable for everyone, especially those who love fast paced gameplay and do not want to patiently learn how to play.   It surpasses its predecessor, Arma 2, in almost every way. There are significantly LESS BUGS and mechanics, UI, AIs, movement and vehicle control is improved. The misfortunes of getting killed in doors from arma 2 are gone and so are many other issues.  The gameplay is extremely slow and maps are simply massive. The one thing that I find annoying is dying to a sniper after running 2km on foot in a mission. I guess it adds to the realism and when playing singleplayer there is a 4x time lapse button.  Strategising is key and it makes this game even better when playing with friends. You must learn the best ways to clear out buildings, find the best angles of attack and you must learn to work as a unit. If your ever going to use those high school geography skills, its going to be when you are using the map is this game when finding grid positions, finding hills and valleys using contour lines and using the compass.   Weapons and their mechanics are well done. Running makes your gun unstable and requires time for you to steady it when you rest. Guns have extremely high recoil which renders automatic fire almost useless, unless you in extreme CQB. Also, weapons are loud and the loudness depends on the weapon and if it has a silencer or not. Loudness translates to detection which the game implements perfectly, gunshot loudness will disappate the further away you are from the shot which makes it realistic. AIs also detect you at different rates which depends partially on how far you fire your gun from them.   Vehicles are a major aspect of the game and each type of vehicles needs to be learnt how to be used effectively. Land vehicles are quite simple and there should be no trouble for anyone there, but air vehicles is where it gets more ticky. They take time to master and must patiently be done. Vehicles range dynamically, from suvs with 50cal mounted MGs and tanks to civilian hatch backs and trucks.   Lastly, the implementation of the workshop was genius, as it made modding extremely easy with a launcher that is simple when disabling and enabling mods without deleting/unsubscribing to them. There are mods which surpass all expectations such as the OPTRE halo mod which adds a ton of content and a weapon pack (I forgot the name) which adds like fifty weapons. The user made scenario missions are very fun to play with friends and difficulty ranges along with the themes of these missions. The mods are essentially unofficial DLCs because of the quality and quantity of thr content they add.  Verdict: All in all, I recommend this game to someone who wants to try something new/different and wants to learn how to utilise new mechanics and play with friends. Arma 3 offers many things that are not present in many games.  9/10 definitely worth the price tag
5233	1	a	If I've spent 1400+ hours playing Arma 3 over a period of just six months that must be a good indication.
5235	1	a	Very adicting, realistic teambase military simulation, highly recommended! &lt;3
5237	1	a	8.9/10  This game is really a harcore FPS. The moments you get stem from bullets whizzing by as you just entered an ambush! You hear your friends yelling over the mic, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ JACK IS DEAD! Every encounter is slow and planned and if it gets big enough becomes hectic. It encompasses BF3 and 4 and even some COD aspects of action (much less COD like .05%). The adrenaline rushes when you see an enemy are astounding, and get amplified as you understand your utter mortality.  The editor is great and I see amazing potential, even full fledged campeigns from users! Albeit it is hard to grasp and understand and requires constant bug testing from the users side to make sure that every trigger etc. work properly. Its as simplified of a complex editor that you can get. Once fully mastered allows for some amazing missions!    The downside is the optiimization, when i first got the game and did multi at the lowest setting i was getting 5 or 10 FPS. Now Im getting a solid 30, the Dev team truly listens. I like that they released this fix before they went on with their campeign etc. Since they realized that the community discovered a game breaking issue (kinda discovered they already knew but did not excpect this to affect so many people).    All in all the game mught have its bugs, but its a fabulous and hardcore game, with an in game editor that's as simple and proffesional as it gets, and a dev team that offer full support to thegame and are constantly improving it!  8.9/10
5239	1	a	10/10  great game, extremely  customisable to your  gaming needs, great replay value.  highly recommended 
5241	1	a	10/10
5243	1	a	This game has over a dozen different ways to crouch and lie down.
5245	1	a	10/10 my favorite game ever walked down the street in rpg some guy knocked me out robbed me and then cut out my kidney then out of no where he just shot me in the head and the tdm/ctf/etc games are fun
5247	1	a	great game overall, needs some optimizition though
5249	1	a	10/10 This is a great game if you are looking for something alot more realistic than COD or BattleField or anything else along those lines. From the campaigns beginning to end you are spending time to even get to the primary objective, this is great because you get to see how much time and effort went into this masterpiece. Then we get into the firefights every thing from learning how to shoot to mastering the ammount of bullet drop for each gun you can spend hours and even days mucking around with the hundreds of controls. On top of that there is DLC and user-made content and I for one cannot describe how much I am anticipating for a dayz mod for this game it would be amazing. 
5251	1	a	I always come back to this game. Great Co-op features.
5253	1	a	The gameplay is great ! But stability :/ with a gtx980TI and i7 4790k I get alot of frames drop ...
5255	1	a	most realistic game i have ever played it has the best physics and to say the game is still being developed is such a good sign of things to come in the future keep up the good work  i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys realistic combat simulators and has the time to spend on this game
5257	1	a	good game to bad i suck at it XD
5259	1	a	its good
5261	1	a	Arma 3 is my favourite game. It offers such a platform, that allows tons of mods such as DayZ, Overwatch, Epoch, Exile, etc. While still being great on its own!  Make sure to have a few friends to play this with, as then the experience is better.   
5263	1	a	It's good.
5265	1	a	Truly immersive experience full of amazing content that will have you playing for hours, definitely worth a buy.
5267	1	a	An in depth and expansive third/first person shooter with the amazing capabilty of catering to multiple different interests and game genres at once, Arma 3 is a pretty good time as long as you have the buddiesa to explore it with. Most complain asbout game performance, and that is because this title relies heavier on your CPU than your GPU, meaning that people with the beastliest of graphics cards can still have issues. This is the only major bad thing about Arma, everything else is fun and accessible, even if there is a major learning curve at the start. If you want to explore vast open worlds, mod the hell out of something, play insane hundred player multiplayer battles, or Role Play as a lone soldier behind enemy lines, Arma 3 is probably for you.
5269	1	a	I love this game. It might be hard to drive for more cheap computer but I had a ok time running it. There are so many different things that you can do in arma I only have a few hours but I already think I'm addicted.
5271	1	a	Sandbox &amp; Editor, what else could you need more? â™¥ MP, Armaholic, Workshop
5273	1	a	Really realistic War Simulator game, lots of action and no russians, Kappa. Nice graphics and gameplay.
5275	1	a	If you dont mind a slower experience, this game can provide a massively varied experience.
5277	1	a	I am very, very conflicted while writing this review. I really loved playing Arma 3. I've had some good times and made some good memmories. And I still havn't even fully explored all the mods that are available! But like I said, I'm conflicted. And here's why.   -No Real Solo Play Online   If you plan on playing alone, prepare to not have fun. Unless you're a gaming golden god with the reaction speed of a gerbil on speed, and the skills of a pro, you're going to be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off a lot. Especially in specific mods that pit you against other players (Wasteland etc.), you will get angry. Playing mods like this you really shouldn't be someone who gets attached to anything, and is basically entertained by anything that goes beyond finding things go 'boom' interresting. If you want to spend quality time, find a MilSim group. But you'll have to spend a good amount of time on ArmA 3 figuring things out, and also trying to actually get INTO a MilSim group.   -The Single Player Campaign   While I found it fairly entertaining, certain points get tedious and annoying. Especially since the AI have special eyes that can see you from 2KM away as if you were 2M away. But all in all; it's a decent campaign to go through once. (quite lengthy too with about 5 or 6 hours on average.)  I don't know if it can be counted as SP, but the Eden editor can be really fun to play around in! Getting actual things done, and making a working MP map is a huge challenge though. It will take many, many hours to get a MP map working and onto the steam workshop!   -The Community   Ehm, how do I put this... The community is... different. While it has the internet classics such as rage kids and memelords, it contains a more rare breed of internet personality; the elitist. Don't be fooled by people saying that the community is mature, because of it's learning curve and MilSim niche-ness. Personally, I find the elitism to be the most annoying part about Arma 3. The players who find the need to rub in their kills. The players who have the humility of a peacock. Which also brings me to the last group of people I'll talk about; the die-hards. We all know them. People who have 2000 hours logged in Arma 3 and eat, breathe and probably excrete Arma. While I don't really have anything against them (They're better then me. Oh well.) but it does get frustrating when you have people that are making their tea and at the same time headshot you from 3KM distance.    Ratings    + Delivers a MilSim game + A decent amount of equipment variety. + Loads and loads of good mods. + Group fun! ;) + The game is pretty stable in my experience. (Bug wise)  +/- Community can sometimes be frustrating. +/- The game itself can get quite frustrating. (unless like I mentioned, you're MLG pro JesusFPS.) +/- Steep learning curve to not-scrubness.  - Requires a lot of time to actually get into the more MilSim multiplayer parts.    Summary    Pretty gud gam. Buy.
5279	1	a	Revert 100 time in Campaign sooooo.. not bad for the first time in Arma series,better then Dark Soul series
5281	1	a	The Most Realistic Military Simulator EVER. Nice Optimisation (much better than Arma 2). Also good graphics and gameplay. The Flying Experience goes from a 4/10 to a 8.5/10, IF you map a joystick to the contols. Though the Game might be a bit pricey, but for 50% off is definitely WORTH IT.  
5283	1	a	This game is very fun to play with freinds and is worth the time and money i spent on arma 3 huge success and many opportunities to come.
5285	1	a	Greatest game ever!!! The best by fare simulation game. All trhe games from Arma all the way up to Arma III are top notch and have more game play in the form of mods to last a lifetime.  This is my got to get listed game! So go get it.
5287	1	a	this is 11/10 died and waited 5 minutues only to drown 9 times in the corner of the map. Would Reccomend this game to those with Aquaphobia. 11/10 would drown again
5289	1	a	Still a few bugs, bouncy servers and could need a better server browser, but Arma 3 is a very good upgraded compared to earlier releases, and one of the best 'simulators' out there. The community keeps this up and running, and their doing a good job.
5291	1	a	One of the BEST shooting games there is on the market!
5293	1	a	This is one of the best games I have ever owned, and the game ive had the most fun on. It might have its glitches and meh optimization but its still a great game. just buy it.
5295	1	a	Made me learn to play with 30 fps. Great game, totally worth it still if it has low FPS. On singleplayer i get 90+ fps on high settings 1080P. Probaly the server's issue or the dedicated server file which bohemia gives to the community. Hope it gets improved in the future
5297	1	a	Best army simulator on the marketplace,idk its rly fun
5299	1	a	itsamust have for PRO gamers!
5301	1	a	Besides having to pay to get most of the game's content, this game has so many possibilities and gamemodes to play. It is lots of fun and keeps me coming back.
5303	1	a	got to play the game for a while.... it was great, until it started to crash like five minutes after i got into a game. still havent found a solution to it and would love if someone inboxed me on how to fix it please
5305	1	a	Very good game to all military lovers
5307	1	a	Rocks still screw up your life 10/10 would run at 10fps again Get it Rocks won't dissipoint you 
5309	1	a	Lots of Fun with a group!
5311	1	a	1000+ Hours of awesomeness
5313	1	a	10/10
5315	1	a	Its a very good game! Specialy the Altis life mode on some server! Great Game!!!!!
5317	1	a	amazing game full of combat. nothing like call of duty were you run around and shoot many people. This game has so much land to explore and camp in maps to kill your enemies.
5319	1	a	awesome game!!! .. even if you buy it just for the Breaking Point mod.. it is worth it!!!
5321	1	a	not too bad not too good just give me achievement
5323	1	a	Arma 3 is by far one of my favorite games in my libary, with 1000+hrs I have yet to get bored with the game it's self. This game provides endless mods and fun! So, what are you still reading this for. Go buy it!
5325	1	a	If you are looking for a really realistic game this is perfect for you. It is probably one of the best games ever made, can be a bit hard to learn due to many controls
5327	1	a	I have played ARMA III for about a few months. I really enjoyed it, Bohemia Interactive actually made a better ARMA! It has perfect Voice Overs instead of ARMA 2 where they read grids lke 2- 1-5-3-5 but in different voices instead of one. I also like the movemet it is great if you want to see over something all you got to do is hold control + w or any wasd key to go in other positions. I onl suggest this game if you got a great computer C: G'day.
5329	1	a	Arma 3 is obviously a better Arma 2, in many ways. Many positives to the game. One of which is the addition of the Steam Workshop. To download missions for Co-Op and Singleplayer. There's no hastle of going to  www.armaholic.com  and downloading missions. Arma 3 is overpriced though...
5331	1	a	its good game with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ engine
5333	1	a	Overall great game, nothing else like it. Bohemia Interactive have made one of the best game series ever made and is a revolutionary game company, think about this Bohemia interactive update their game for free I'd say about every month or so with MASSIVE amounts of new features bug fixes new things to do and new ideas. When Bohemia wants to make a DLC they only put things that are not going to divide their multiplayer community (some people not being able to use important things because they do not have the DLC) in their DLC's, along with coming out with new features for the community as a whole; such as shooting from vehicles, advanced flight model, and bipods. Take a look at any other triple A game company and Bohemia Interactive is on a completely different level than said company. There is always something new to do in ArmA, especially since the new Eden Editor came out which allows for the community to make missions in a 3d environment with scripting, timing, individual attributes, the Eden Editor provides the community with a way to make their own content allowing for ArmA to keep getting refreshed; just look at the workshop. In the end   ArmA III is the best game Bohemia Interactive has made so far, and will continue to provide me and my friends hours of fun in times to come.     TL;DR: 10/10 IGN buy this game because its the most functional piece of art on the planet.
5335	1	a	This game is great and very realistic, but you definitely need to play this with friends and it has a definite learning curve.
5337	1	a	  Was given this game as a gift from a friend and would say that I would pay for it if I had not gotten it as a gift. The game is worth retail to anyone who enjoys playing First Person Shooters as well as strategy as you will get nowhere with just trying to point and shoot. Physics and Bullet dynamics are all very realistic and can be affected by many things. This game is on the top of my list. 5/5
5339	1	a	Great game for those interested iin tactics and strategy and not run and gunning!
5341	1	a	buy this game
5343	1	a	Very nice game i like it! 
5345	1	a	well wtf this game is amazing its hard AT TIMES but over all really good i have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc ok 20 fps is ok but over all u can run it and its a sick game
5347	1	a	Awesome game, sandbox, immersion and tons of excellent mods make it THE best fps, and its flexibility allow you to get you in both arcadish missions as well as some realistic mil sim missions. Flexibility of missions is so wide that in any other game we would have called it mods. But in arma, its only autodownloadable missions, no need to suscribe to gigabytes of mods to have a real variety of game types. Mods can adds some very nice units or maps if you want to go deeper.
5349	1	a	It's very pretty and does it's job as my benchmark tool for computer hardware.
5351	1	a	7.5/10 Good: Huge open-world map, variety of community content, improvements from ARMA 2 Bad: Lack of official content, some promised features scrapped, short campaign with convoluted plot
5353	1	a	i absolutely love this game, its got a great campaign and also you can have open world to look around for resources to help you on your next mission. i really love this game and recomend it to anyone who is a military fan-boy
5355	1	a	this game is gr8 m8 because i r8 is 8/8. King of the Hill is best tho
5357	1	a	If you have a good enough computer to run it then its definitley worth it.
5359	1	a	A great all round game that can be modded to do almost anything you enjoy, there are servers for RP, mass carnage, and then there is the popular Exile mod that i enjoy playing alot on as well due to the crazy amount of weapons that extra mods can bring to the game and various new ways you can hunt other players.
5361	1	a	That how Arma gose . in the first 24 hours you dont know what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you doing i\or how to move and try to jump. aftar the 24 hrs you releas you cant jump but you can use  with all the cars hllicopter and more i have 1300Hrs on the game and i am still learning . good luck ,  10/10
5363	1	a	Breaking Point Mod!
5365	1	a	One of the best Fps games i have ever played! Really fun with friends.
5367	1	a	Needs a pretty buff computer to play well, I had a lot of lag because my computer didn't reach the requirements. But that's pretty much my fault, not the game's. It's pretty good.
5369	1	a	This game lead me to my breakup as i gave more time to it than my bae :D Its worth it :D
5371	1	a	great game
5373	1	a	Can anyone tell me how to sort this out please it everytime i go to play a game i have 16gb of ram and a 2tb hardrive it says 'The instruction at 0x01630984 referenced memory at 0x00000088. the memory could not be writen i cant play the game at al its a great game just dont understand why it does this only started last week :(
5375	1	a	1000 hours in and still learning â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game daily   Love it
5377	1	a	has been playing this game from v1.14 pirated version so my actual hours I spent was more than 1,5k hours maybe. Bought the legit copy on 2015, worth the full price but I'm just broke lol.   The game itself is basically a sandbox with many potential scenarios and situations the only limits was your imagination and your will. Once you finished the campaign you probably trying any casual gameplay like Wasteland, Altis Life, Exile etc. Or if you like zombies you might like Breaking Point, Exile with Zombies, and many variation of them until you don't even know what do you want to play. So much things to do.  Or if you into realism or immersion of military simulation, you can join any Unit and play like actual soldier in battlefield following some protocols, radio and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It maybe sound so serious but trust me it was fun. There are many things you don't expect to be happen but turns out it was a hilarious experience with your teammates or some dumb acts someone did makes you laugh.  For regular player you might found Arma have complicated action button on the keyboard, a lot of it but you will get used to it. And Arma have REALLY BIG maps like, dude it was 20km square ! people sometimes joking about it called 'asthmatic jogging simulator' because you will mostly run one to other place very often. even running 1km take a few minutes on foot. But if you playing a scenario mission it wont be matter as long as you put some vehicle in advantage point and keep the immersive gameplay.  what its good about Arma ? its THE MODS. the community keeps growing and there is some awesome authors put their effort and times making cool mods like new maps, new weapon and etc. You may ended up having mod running 50gb on your disk.  Lets talk about downside. Some people complaining about its performance on multiplayer like having very low fps although you running a monster pc race. Well, basically arma is calculating everything ingame, your character, the environment, weather, time, bullet trajectory, ambient sound, animation, AI, etc. It's not suprised if you lagging if you put too much mod and a heavily scripted mission because the server or your pc calculating every script on air and sync it to every player, so if the server have 40 player on it its like the server have 40 time load than regular one. Its logical i think but I hope BIS would improve their coding so we have a better fps on multiplayer.  Also if you even enter the forums.bistudio, many people complaining about BIS didn't looking after problem that existed but focusing on adding new feature. Well, there is some demand from player to fix some their basic feature I hope they listen to their community.   So overall verdict from me:  Graphics : 7.5/10 (gettings better) Sound : 8.5/10 (just like real life) Gameplay : 8/10 (just what I am into) Overall : 8/10 (recommended for you if you like gameplay like arma)
5379	1	a	Well, look at my game hours.   This game played in vanilla isn't very realistic, i suggest getting a couple mods installed and search for a clan.  Well, in all of my game hours I played in many clans, many gamemods and a lot of ranking up in certain clans.  Have a good game if you'll buy it :)
5381	1	a	I Have over 1100 hours on record with this game since Early Access.  The game has become much more user friendly since coming out, if you want a casual to all the way hardcore MILSIM experience, look no further.  Pro's: Huge Scale  Gorgeous visuals  Large selection of weapons  Realistic Ballistics, physics, damage implementation for various calibers, realistic Flight model including but not limited too advanced flight model implementation such as stalls, vortex ring state, damaged instrument panels and etc.  Welcoming community  Insane amount of free mods and maps (Including weapons, textures, sounds for weapons such as DragonFyre sound mod and etc..)  Tutorials that actually teach you how to play and how to not only react to contact and ambushes but also teaches you how to team play as part of a larger assault element and also combined arms (Ever wanted to be in the big boy army and participate in a large scale attack? look no further).  Good single Player Campaign.  Con's  Can still have a steep learning curve, mission making takes practice, more advanced missions scripting requires a decent concept of game script writing  Very very un-optimized for current Gen CPU's. Single thread performance only, can be resource intensive, recommend a i7 CPU for decent game play, takes a beast of a rig to run with everything maxed out in multiplayer (FPS in multiplayer is based off server side FPS and NOT client side aka your PC FPS, hence even powerful pc's can get stutter in large scale multiplayer games).  Can get pretty big in size if you subscribe to a large number of mods  Some mods can interfere with others.  TL:DR Since coming out Arma 3 has become much easier to learn and grasp with new and improved tutorials and scenarios, amazing mod support and close knit community help overcome and issues with this game such as optimization issues and map creation tools. If you do get this game, highly recommend finding a MILSIM unit and or group of players to help guide you in starting out in this game.  My Rig Specs for playing this game (At 1920x1080 with 2x FXAA and view distance of 2500 meters)  i7 3770k Over clocked too 4.1 Ghz 16GB DDR3 10600 RAM EvGA GTX 970 Superclocked (OC 100mhz GPU, 500Mhz Memory) Samsung 840 Pro SSD Windows 10 64bit
5383	1	a	8/10 for being a one of a kind game. It is a massive scale, realistic military game with a developer that generally listens to its community and embraces mods. Also, Tanoa is flippin awesome.  -1 for the action menu not being replaced  -1 for no ability to play as female player model in vanilla game. It's 2035 Bohemia!
5385	1	a	1. Too much Altis Life 2. I hate Altis Life (My option dont try changing it) 3. Everything beside Altis Life is fun 4. Altis Life as Server name takes around 400+ servers 5. There are 4000 servers in total
5387	1	a	This is a fun and clever military experience, that does a great job at making you feel like you're on the battlefield. It is hard to get use to a first, but in time, you will learn the basics of Arma 3
5389	1	a	Best War Simulator so far after Arma 2! If you love sim, or maybe you love realistic system, or maybe you just love to setup your own epic movie scene, this is the game for you! :D  SIMPLY THE BEST
5391	1	a	Made an ac-130 with tanks and a small plane... 11/10 -ign
5393	1	a	its the perfect mil-sim game ever .... i just joined and i lost my mind .... really good game worth it ....
5395	1	a	Its a cool realistic game! i love it!
5397	1	a	This is the best game out there so download it now or u will be depressed for the rest of ur life. The mods for this game are great too! Like Breakingpoint, Epoch, Battle Royale, and many more great mods!
5399	1	a	Arma 3 is incredible. If you are looking for a game that gets as real as possible this is it, its not even a game its a war simulator. Missions are satisfying and even when they go bad its an unforgetable time.  Dont play arma without mods, you are missing the point of it.
5401	1	a	This game is great. I have dedicated all my free time to playing this. When it gets boring just download some mods!
5403	1	a	Great game it is the most realistic game i have played. The bullet mechanics are amazing such as you can only penetrate through an amount or a type of wall with types of guns as a sniper could go through 7 walls about but at that amount the bullet goes down a lot and makes it a quite horrible shot though can still lead to death. The helicopters are good as well so are the jets as helicopters can/may have flares which deviate from the jets lock on and will miss which is a good way to nerf the jet without actually nerfing it. Game has a lot of game modes and even game modes made by the players themselves which make it more fun E.G Altiz Life.  Though a thing that should be removed is the DLC as you need to pay to actually get the full game really. You want to snipe? That's an extra Â£7 you want more choppers that are better than the default? That will be an extra Â£7. Though there is an exception for one DLC that does not matter the go karts DLC as it is just there for people that would like it though the rest should be removed.  I would recommend this to people that like realistic games and not games that are just run and gun.
5405	1	a	This game is really fun to play with friends and yourself and a great shooter game.
5407	1	a	It is was a really nice game and all the stuff you could do. man i cant put it in words just buy it.
195	0	a	I pre-ordered arma 3 deluxe almost as soon as it was available, i was hyped for arma 3, and despite what my hours reflect (steam is weird with offline hours) i have played the crap out of this game; i want, no i NEED, to love this game, day 1 i convinced 3 of my friends to buy arma 3 so we could play co op together, and i'm regretting doing that.   The Game:  The game plays just how youâ€™d expect from an arma game, some bugs, it's weird quirks like you can vault into a wall and kill yourself, despite walking 10 feet and laying idle for half an hour my trained military professional can't stop from shaking around like a heroin addict. Still, its arma and i enjoy the game, i would recommend it itâ€™s really fun.   Unfortunately the one thing i was super excited for was under water combat, water infiltration etc, i was sooo hyped for it, and then i played the diving showcase, and i was miserably disappointed. First off, there's only 3 positions you can be in, standing straight up and down, on your back, or on your stomach, is there a guy directly above you you want to shoot? well that sucks, embrace your impending death. you can't move 360 in the water, which is just terrible, the underwater combat and movement is miserably disappointing. A massive, massive, massive let down.  Still, there's hope!!! who doesn't love helicopters in arma right? i'll just wait for it to be releasedâ€¦ oh cool! just got a notification that helicopters have been released, let's just jump in a- wait what? i need a dlc? to fly a helicopter? well thatâ€™s weird but okay, it's probably like 99 cents or 2 dollars nothing maj- 16 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!! WHAT!!!! okay, maybe it's justified, there's probably like at least 15-20 helicopters right? 2 helicopters, for 15 dollars? are you kidding me? what the hell is this, no discount for deluxe owners? so i payed all that money for a map and an easily stolen mp3 files, great.   alright, thereâ€™s still one thing i like in arma, sniping! itâ€™s so much fun to sniper in arma, we all know it, soon theyâ€™ll add sniper rifles and i'll be able to run around ghilling it up picking off opfor. alright! marksmen weapons added, 5 marksmen weapons added too!! sweet i was worried they would add one rifle at a time. letâ€™s just load up a game and get sniping away, 16 DOLLARS AGAIN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME, 16 DOLLARS FOR 5 RIFLES 2 MACHINEGUNS AND A GHILLIE SUIT!!!!!!!!!!!  oh also they added a go kart dlc, which is really fun and worth the 2 dollars it costs, like all dlc for this game should but doesnâ€™t.  In conclusion, it could have been a great game, murdered by dlc preventing you from using things in the game, i canâ€™t wait for the bullet DLC to let you use Bullets. it would be different if it was something not crucial to game play, who wants to do a mission on a massive island without helicopters? who wants to stealth around or take out targets without marksmen rifles? go karts? yeah it's nice, cheap DLC, not crucial to game play. so so game mechanics, if you like arma you'll like it, disappointing diving, and be prepared to spend at least 32 dollars extra just to play the game. also thanks for charging us extra for trusting you and pre-ordering the game, if i had waited and bought the game now it would've cost me less. thanks.   oh yeah, and good luck getting more than 30 fps on your thousands of dollars in hardware, this game has about as much optimization was windows 10.
5409	1	a	I have to say I don't know how play this if I haven't a team .so I think if u want a good game time you must have a team together .
5411	1	a	Arma 3 is a good military simulator although not in the real era of Arma 2 it still uses real world models to base their weapons and vehocles off. The game does have its flaws but with a bit of modding you can make it ANYTHING! Seriously you can. It's a great game which you should enjoy if you like real military themed games. Also you will need decently fast internet otherwise things can go all.... lets say.... potato. But overall this is an amazing game and very fun when playing with friends.
5413	1	a	  i just play it for the mariokarts
5415	1	a	Only fun for about 20 mins.
5417	1	a	Great game, love it!
5419	1	a	ArmA 3.. Been with you since Alpha and now Apex is coming. It's a great game, really isn't much more to say. If you want a challenging, time consuming and at the same time fun tactical shooter, this is the game for you. If you expect CoD or BF, go away, right now.  Pros:  - Great mechanics - Huuuge detailed maps with so many towns, cities and etc - Enjoyable vehicular combat and mechanics - Great (but cliche) single player campaign for a first person shooter - Fun multiplayer with unlimited gamemodes to download as mods - Eden Editor makes it fun to set up your own missions for training/fun - Great modding community  Cons:  - The engine should be replaced for the next title, very unoptimized with huge frame drops even on good PCs. - The action menu needs to go, seriously. - A bit of a pain to set up a joystick for fixed-wings/helicopters - Rain/storms could still look better, happens you see patches of blue sky right above your head  For any tactical shooter fan out there, this is a must have. But try to go into the game without comparing it to other FPS games. Just because it can be hard and has complex mechanics, doesn't mean the game sucks
5421	1	a	800 hours of gameplay and not nearly seen or done everything the game has to offer

5425	1	a	Great game
5427	1	a	Most amazing game out in my opinion. I purchased a gaming pc for this game.... ðŸ˜† I'm sure alot of people did ðŸ˜‚
5429	1	a	It's a game.
5431	1	a	This game singlehandedly ruined my life, one of the most addicting games ive ever played. 10/10
5433	1	a	This game is actually really fun. My pc was pretty dang bad when I looked at the specs so that's my bad for being stupid. I decided to get a new pc and now its fun.
5435	1	a	when you get 60fps in this game. 60fps=cheating in arma.
5437	1	a	Well Arma.. is it good or not? I think the Arma(s) are great because of the community. Arma III is here with us since 2013 and it has changed a lot. When it first saw the Sun light it was buggy and badly optimized. I know. I was there at the begining (not with this acc.). After a time it started changing in a good way. Many new things have come: updates, fps improvment, bipods!, mods. Mods changed my way of thinking about Arma III. I used to be pessimistic and I didn't play a lot with it. But as these things came I started beleiving Arma III is good, it's getting better. I started using many mods, tons of maps and so on. Arma III is a great game so as Arma II. The main issue with this game is the people who can't see that this is not a COD or a BF. There are people out there crying about the realism of the game. I think this is the main reason why many people play it: the realism. It's great playing for hours in a milsim or in a CTI game. I can only recommend this game for people who loves these kind of games. It's not that expensive as it used to be, but I highly recommend firstly download this game from a website, try out if it's working and after that buying it. +thing: the camera mode. It's a great fun for people who are take shots with there camera in real life.
5439	1	a	most realistic shooter out there. will take a bit of getting used to, but its worth it!
5441	1	a	Check out my Friend's review who is the best Arma player I have ever seen or known, I cant explain it better than him. Steam name: Divercsip
5443	1	a	Probably my favorite game. i give it a 8/8, its great m8.
5445	1	a	+One of the best war simulator games ever! +Very easy to install mods +Nice world interactive (about 80% of the buildings can be destroyed) +Nice maps +Cool Graphics  -Some bugs -Hard to control by newbies  8/10
5447	1	a	If you're looking for a smoth 60 fps multiplayer experience, then go away.  Unless you own a NASA computer.
5449	1	a	Ultra realistic military game, unlike anything I've ever seen
5451	1	a	Very realistic video game
5453	1	a	Amazing Game, honestly. Its a very fun game to play with friends or alone.   10/10
5455	1	a	Very fun and emmersive, especially when you a group of friends get together and work as a team. One of my favorite games of all time.
5457	1	a	I love this game there is always so much to do I never get bored.
5459	1	a	Awesome. 30 FPS with mario graphics .  I Can only compare how hard this game is to run .... like a boner , hard at first , then after a while you just deal with it
5461	1	a	In my opinion, Arma 3 is the best military sandbox currently available on PC.   The game has a bit of a learning curve and the base game can leave something to be desired but, the sheer amount of mods/custom missions available add countless hours of gameplay, which is almost as staggering as it's expectional predecessor (Arma 2).  10/10 Army Men for Adults.
5463	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing! with all it's mods! 10/10 would buy again
5465	1	a	AMD is for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5467	1	a	Very good game 10/10 would kill again
5469	1	a	this game as the best fire fights they really get your blood pumping and its not about running and gunning u got to use strategy with your buddys. You got to be patient and wait for your target, its really a good looking game when your on a hill sniping down in to a town or in a jet or helo up above the clouds.
5471	1	a	good game mediocre performance
5473	1	a	Wow, where do I start with this game? There is just some much to it that its hard to narrow down the game to your basic FPS, because its   MUCH   more than that.     Basics
5475	1	a	ARMA3 is such a great improvment over ARMA2 it's....Amazing  If you're looking at the price and you go...ohh It's a bit much...  Factor in how much time you can waste on this game over some cheap POS on a steam Sale  It truely is an awesome game!
5477	1	a	Stunning Game, i guess the one thing i've always loved about the ArmA series is the  MASSIVE   range of community mods.   So many new gamemodes are developed every few months you can never get bored.      9/10 (DLC's bit stingy)        Stay Spooky   
5479	1	a	A great game with extendability
5481	1	a	One of the best games on steam. Countless hours of fun, so much worth.
5483	1	a	This is the kind of game that PC gamers should be proud of.  There is a hard learning curve when you start with it but the options you get, the possibilities, all the mods, game types, content is worth enough for the sacrifice.  The game is best played with friends, theres plenty of communities out there to joi n, no matter if you are new or a veteran most of them will welcome you.  
5485	1	a	This is a awesome game! It's a Army Simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire, you won't be seeing much of that. The vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. I would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.
5487	1	a	Arma 3 is most likely to be my most favorite game ever. I have put over 2000 hours into the game so I know a lot about it. It is indeed very buggy but its super fun. There are tons of things to do inside of Arma 3  I spend most of my time playing Battle Royale. I would really recommend this game for people that like Army sims.
5489	1	a	This game is great. I come from Dayz so I love mods like exile. If anyone plays this mod or similar mods, add me and let's play.
5491	1	a	great game, great single player and mp, great community and great mods.
5493	1	a	The community has a powerful effect on the game. Different game mods,maps,addons and alot more. Definitely worth it.
5495	1	a	SUPA HOT FIYA, I SPIT THAT.
5497	1	a	A really good game for people that like War mods and other things vehicles Helicopters and tanks   My Personal Favorite Mod: Overpoch  http://customcombatgaming.com/forums/index.php?/page/index.html   U can build bases on it theres lots of different guns a lot of war 10/10 mod
5499	1	a	I want to start off saying that I absolutely love this game.. However, I've managed to log a fair amount of hours and I've noticed that with every update that bohemia puts out, this game loses playability. Fps drops, glitches, screwed up animations, and exploits. When I first started playing Arma 3, it was beautiful. I had no problems running this game at all. With the last three updates it has gotten worse each time. Bohemia needs to finish the game and test their content before the release it to ruin the gameplay experience for their hefty price tag on this title. When this game is functioning properly, it's by far one of the best games I've ever played and by far the most realistic. It has very diverse gameplay, with many mods available via  armaholic.com  and the DLC that they've released with the game.   So in summary, if I'm paying 59.99 for Arma 3 and also buying their DLC, along with all of the other paying customers. The developers of said title should have enough funds and the ability to ensure that their game works properly.
5501	1	a	Great for its expansive multiplayer communities and units. Bad for its underwhelming vehicles, but of course, mods make this game truly great.
5503	1	a	Arma 3 is amazing. While the story is a bit bland in some parts, jump on any combat servers and you'll have a blast.   Pros -Amazing weapon/vehicle system -Destruction (Nothing like BF4, but its good) -Doesn't run like a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (Like Arma 2 or Dayz) -Amazing game engine, more pretty than Arma 2 and optomized better. -Lots of gamemodes, including Altis Life and Wasteland  Cons -World's Most Original Story  -On servers, the fps is determined by server fps. -Hard to spot Ai (Maybe thats just me) -Killed pretty easily (Again, maybe thats just me)  Overall, it's a pretty good game. Pick it up on a sale if you can or want.  8/10
5505	1	a	I liked the game but the fact that i payed for it a week ago and it when up for sale the next week is anoying
5507	1	a	Increadibly realistic the best game i have ever bourght!
5509	1	a	A great game very fun for life servers and Milsim things everyone should Play.
5511	1	a	I absolutely LOVE arma. I am particularly a patron of Exile and TLS. It's an amazing game with something like 2 cents per hour of entertainment. Definitely recommend if you like milsim or roleplay. :D
5513	1	a	one word to describe this game 'unreal'. this game is amazing it not only has an incredible story it also has a vast range of mulitplayer gamemodes like; atlis life, invade adn annex, king of the hill, gun game,wasteland,dayz(epoch and such) and many more.  This game also looks incredibly the only down side is that you need a beastly PC to run it and even then if you get 100 fps on high settings in singleplayer for soem reason multiplayer just eats FPS thats the only major problem   The game has very few glitches (of the ones i have found/coem across)  overall the game is a blast and unlike other games whic are just story based and you could only get so many hours out of it this game (like csgo) you can have unlimited amount of hours but its up to you what you send thme doing
5515	1	a	  Bought Arma 3. Got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Sold cocaine. Killed friends and foes. 10/10
5517	1	a	I love this game because it's the only one of its kind. I hate this game because it's the only one of its kind and I need to swallow all the terrible flaws this game has ;_; &lt;3 Thanks bohemia for making the best poorly designed master piece there is.  Pls write a new engine from scratch for the next installment with all that DZ and Arma monies you have so you'll actually know how everything in your engine works. You don't fool me, there is tons of files names .ofp or ofp2 (Operation Flashpoint, Operation Flashpoint 2 [Arma 2] )
5519	1	a	Really good game. Got over 700hrs and still not bored. Only thing is it is purely optimised and as I have a AMD processor I only get 17-20 fps
5521	1	a	I've always looked at it like this...  Call of Duty is for kids. Battlefield is for teens. Squad is for adults. Arma is for veterans with PTSD.  In all seriousness this game has so much to do and play when you add up the RP games, the actual Arma gameplay, and modded gameplay. You will like playing it alone, you will love playing it with a friend, and you will hate playing it with several friends because no matter how much you vet who you're playing with you will always get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ friend who is a team killer. 
5523	1	a	Amazing game, mostly play for the roleplay, but the campain is phenomanal -good graphics -strong multiplayer and campain -good roleplay
5525	1	a	i played it, as a steam trial, so it was pretty good
5527	1	a	10/10 Game been playing this for awhile and can't stop playing it.
5529	1	a	This game is a must buy. I normally play wasteland and it the most fun ive had on the game. If you want to have a crazy experience play with the new apex update in the tanoa map.
5531	1	a	brilant game , but its not good for king of the hill any more as there are hardly any servers
5533	1	a	This game is one of the best games i have ever played. It has a large selection of mods that keep it fresh to this day. The multiplayer is amazing with game modes verying from TDM to large scale combat.
5535	1	a	Top quality army simulator
5537	1	a	Arma 3 is a well made next game in the Arma series with many options you can do. Now I played many different modes and mods that I should give you a decent review about this game.  Story  I do know that there are not many people that want to buy Arma 3 because of the story, but it still has one and isn\'t bad. It is a new story and does not have something to do with Arma 2 or else. The story starts with a mission for you and another soldier to help out another Camp, but on youÂ´re way there an invasion of the AFF starts over the hole Island and you and youÂ´re superior that is with you at that time try to get to a safe place to reform their allies. This getÂ´s harder than though because the AFF troops are anywhere but helpfully there were some units from the UK that helps out and you can regroup with them and so the story starts where you try to get connected to another safe Island and do many different tasks.  Gameplay   You can control land sea and air craft vehicles or go by you\'re own foot on the maps Stratis or Altis and many modded maps. There is not rally a task given to you by the game, besides the story, there are many different tasks given to you by community made co-op missions or PvP modes and also the complete different thing like a real life in modes like good known \'Altis Life\'. But besides Altis Life or other similar mods this is a military simulation game and give you many possibilities to let it feel like that. In co-op missions in a group of friends you need to make a briefing of the situation and make a plan or just go on patrol and get surprised by an attack of an opposite fraction and many more kind of situations. There are too many different gameplay methods given to you by the community that I can not listen them all up here.  Pros: -maybe one of the best military simulation games so far -many and sometimes comepletly different kind of gameplay methods -good graphics  -game gets upadatet by the developers to fix bugs and make the game just better -active community -Steam Achievements -you can use the terrain to your advantage  Neutral: -KI is okay as an enemy in co-op missions and is not completely stupid but also not perfect right now  Cons: -hard to remember all the keys for new beginners -many bugs(like falling trough some stairs and die or looking trough a wall) -the game has FPS problems like FPS drops   Conclusion: This game has many good things to offer and is one of the most realistic games so far (especially with mods), but it still needs to get patched and fix bugs. Arma 3 is a game you should buy because of the game play you will not have in any game I know right now and you get to live with the bugs and learn to avoid them as much as possible and if you have friends to play with this game can get you many hours of fun game play to get.  
5539	1	a	Life? what life. My life is gone. One of the best games to date. Watch yaself a youtube vid then make your self a mission or jump onto a server with 100 other people and die from lag. But you will stall keep coming back for more.  
5541	1	a	it is a realistic simulation game cross from military combat to roleplay enviroment interesting and you won't find another game out there like this one
5543	1	a	It's relly fun gane i have over 600h in it there's atis life &amp; life mods &amp; King Of The Hill &amp; wastland
5545	1	a	Totally worth the arm it costs to buy it.
5547	1	a	Great military simulator, I'd recommend after you're used to controls to join a community. For me, the best fun you can get is playing co-op/PvP missions with friends. If you're feeling hardcore join a milsim unit, or if you want something a bit more casual join a casual community/unit. You'll meet a bunch of new people and hopefully have fun.
5549	1	a	Noice Game
5551	1	a	Any other FPS, is just a toy.
5553	1	a	After coming from DayZ Standalone, I was pretty excited to try this out. I first play a co-op mission and meet really cool guys and made a friend. Next day I played battle royale...  Let's just say I might die with my fingers on the keyboard.  Buy it.                                      Why haven't you bought it yet?                                                                                   Seriously? BUY IT.   
5555	1	a	bets game evr i love this game to death i would play it everyday
5557	1	a	This game is absolutley amazing in just about every way. The game itself is pretty good and has a brutal campaign that will last you a long time. But the true ARMA experience is the multiplayer which delivers time and time again with players even making their own regiments,companies, and divisions. And if the game gets boring like it did for me there is always the steam workshop with a never ending amount of mods to keep you interested like new nations, weapons, vehicles, maps, functions, characters, scenarios, re skins, and much more.
5559	1	a	This is a great game and well worth the money spent. However, since I've been playing from the begining of the Alpha, it's not quite as fresh as I'd like.  Good on it's own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions.  The DLC is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.
5561	1	a	very good and fun game! highly rercommend
5563	1	a	  Lots of versatility and tons to do, extremely moddable and a lot of fun to play with friends. Overall its a great game for military simulation or just messing around with friends... Maybe role playing? A ton of fun.
5565	1	a	Well since Ive logged over 1500 hours in this game, I figured I cook up a review and maybe these types of reviews with people who have more than 500+ hours can be trsuted more than the common, 2hr junky and already talking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the game.  Anyway, as a military veteran, this game has never fell short to living up to the expectations that I had been hyped for when I first purchased it. Mods, mods and many more mods, that can sum up what I do mostly on this game and if you have the pastience for mods and and server hopping every now and then, then this game will suit you well. I have no complaints for this game because it is always being updated almost 1 a month and mods just keep rolling in all the time. Community is as cancer as any game community, half of them are trying to be trols and the others just dream to big to be like the big youtubers.   
5567	1	a	This game is totally KEK!
5569	1	a	This is an amazing game it's swallowed up a lot of my life with a lot of different servers to check out and explore, ranging from Roleplay servers to hardcore Military simulation.  The ArmA 3 community on the whole is great, however if you are looking for 'Community spirit' when playing a Roleplay server such as the 'Life' series, I'd go ahead and not even bother purchasing the game.  Otherwise, this is a very good game and I would reccomend this to anyone who has the spare time that it will consume.
5571	1	a	great game
5573	1	a	Most realistic game ever.
5575	1	a	It's an awesome game
5577	1	a	Fun simulator, good graphics, BIS is good people.
5579	1	a	It's ok I guess.
5581	1	a	Most fun I've had in a game in years. Realistic bullet physics. A+
5583	1	a	  There is so much to do in this game. I highly recommend it; however, if you are new then watch tutorials on the internet or the first weeks of owning this would be frustrating.
5585	1	a	Highly recommend the game ! Awesome with various modes and really fun to play.  8/8 'Would buy again' - Bonito
5587	1	a	  Really cool u need a good computer to have good graphics and make it smooth
5589	1	a	its real good, buy now
5591	1	a	This is so good!! So realistic omg!
5593	1	a	Very good game when playing with friends and by far the most realistic one I have seen
5595	1	a	This game is amazing I only have a few hours in it but IM IN LOVE !!!
5597	1	a	  The best Army games and best czech game.
5599	1	a	Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in Military Simulation Game Ever  I would my friends to buy it
5601	1	a	Its a great game and im always excited to start up an operation, especially with the Milsim unit im in. We typically use mods and non base game maps and items to further add to the experience, although we have a base arma public server its always funt o play either, communities can be great in this game and although it isnt the best optimized it isnt too much of a problem to everyone. IFf your interested in our Milsim, its call Task Force Spartan. We have a TS and a website, the links:  http://taskforcespartanrealism.shivtr.com/  If your interested join the website make an Application and we will definetly explain anything you want to know after. In any case id recommend this game and many communities to anyone who enjoys some good teamwork and a bit of milsim in their lives.
5603	1	a	This game is really good if your like war and action games this will give you so much joy in it.
5605	1	a	Love it can't get. Enough of arma  
5607	1	a	It's just really good.
5609	1	a	It's decent if you have a monster computer otherwise it's a lag-fest and it'll be hell to get it running smoothly.
5611	1	a	This is a great game to play with friends
5613	1	a	in this game you know that 20 fps are playable.  10/10 would glitch in stone again.
5615	1	a	An extremely large amount of stuff to do in many extremely large environments. Campaign, multiplayer, roleplaying, co-op, side-ops, helicopters, tanks, lots of other vehicles including go-karts, bullet-dropping, weather, wind, wildlife, etc. I had not played the campaign yet, so I cannot say it is good or not, but the game itself and all the content is worth what ever it is priced now.
5617	1	a	i don't even have this game but i still can review it uhhhhhh
5619	1	a	Bought it this morning, pretty good so far 10/10
5621	1	a	:3
5623	1	a	Really good all round would strongly recommend
5625	1	a	This game is simply amazing, let me tell you why. If you buy this game for it's default gamemode just don't do it well, if you want to you can but it's really boring, i bought this game mainly for Battle Royale and Roleplay (Arma Life, Altis Life). I suggest this game to be played with friends so it won't become boring. Roleplay is love, Roleplay is life.
5627	1	a	Hard to run on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc == Little to no 10 year olds! Yay!
5629	1	a	10/10. The best shooter game, and one of the best sandbox games. Who needs call of duty when this game exists?
5631	1	a	Game was the best purchase i have had in many years and i look forward to playing it in the future.
5633	1	a	Well Built Game Worth The Buy. Hours Of Fun
5635	1	a	I love to allah akbar in t4 with my mohawk on KoTH
5637	1	a	10/10
5639	1	a	10/10. A bit compicated. Great value for your money!
5641	1	a	I have been playing Bohemia Interactive games since 2001, Operation Flashpoint. Spent large portion of my life with them I treat them as a part of it. This game is pinnacle of what Bohemia has already offered us and it will be further expanded, possibilites are limitless we should be very excited. I rate it 100/10, if you want realistic shooter for productive adults, this is the game for you.
5643	1	a	Quick question. Are you a simulator guy, but also a big fan of FP Shooters?  If you answered yes, this is a game for you.   It looks amazing, just look at it, LOOK at it. I don't have the new Apex DLC, but the more i see of it the more i think its worth the full price, but i will wait for sale, cuz i ain't got that much money.   Multiplayer experiance is just insane, you can do anything you wish to do, and there are some Roleplay servers that are equally as fun. Communication sometimes gives me and other people problem, but for the most part it works great.  If you are just a FPS fan, it's not a game for you. This is mostly the game where you will run 2km only to get instashot in the head. It's that reason your every step has to be responsable and overthought. You don't wanna go rushing in.   The only part i don't like it's how its set in this 'future' and there are some weapons there that just look too familliar but are not what you expected. I don't see much point on not just all bringing a machinegun with some scope on it to battle. All weapons pretty much shoot the same but some have more bullets.  I like the pistols though, people usually laugh when they see a little pistol, especially in a roleplay server, but they stopped laughing when i put a bullet in their head with it.  Overall this game is a solid 9/10. Buy it.
5645	1	a	Best Milsim out there!   The only thing is optimization, this game needs it bad! its been out 2 years and its still not good. 8/10 I shouldnt be only getting 45-55 FPS on servers with a Gigabyte 980 Ti G1. I should be getting 70-90FPS if they fix that i would give it a 10/10. If they change the optimization they game would be amazing!
5647	1	a	hi my battleye dont work plz help me 
5649	1	a	11/10 not worth it. Stole my life. Calculated out, so far has taken 102 days of my life, more to come. Please send help
5651	1	a	   Introduction  
5653	1	a	The absolut biggest reason why i love ArmA 3 and i hope if they make a sequal of the game with this i will be thrilled. It's Zues. Using Zues is like an amazing sandbox and i really really hope if the make another ArmA game they have Zues in it. Other wise if they don't add zues to the following game, i will still continue playing ArmA 3 cause no game so far has beaten its amazing experince in the zues gameplay.
5655	1	a	Great Game! Nuff said!
5657	1	a	I think Arma 3 is an awesome game to play. This game has a large amount of custom scenario missions which are really fun to do. I definitely recommend this game.  10/10
5659	1	a	Realistic as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.. get this game.. its a really good game, it has jets, helicopters, submarines, tanks and stuff.. its really good fun :D
5661	1	a	I truly enjoy this game. It is very fun. It would be better if the ai werent so strong. I swear it takes 10 shot in the head to kill one. But other than that it is great!
5663	1	a	You Couldn't even run this with the matrix.
5665	1	a	It is pretty good.
5667	1	a	This game is really fun with alta life and wasteland plus breaking point makes it worth it alone.. plus i got it when it was on sale for $35 ^_^
5669	1	a	Good game, I would recommend to players who are into military simulator. This game includes variety of guns and vehicles.
196	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game. If you have some seriously beefy hardware you can run this game 60+ fps. But for us simple plebs, we get solid 30's and 20's. Fun otherwise :)
5671	1	a	When i die im getting plugged into this game
5673	1	a	It's a game that opens a gateway to mods that are better than the game.
5675	1	a	With many fun laughs to be had, and memories to be shared, this is a great game (so as long as you have friends to play with). While a terrible single player expierience, due to extreme boredom and blandness, it is terrific in multiplayer.
5677	1	a	THis is a rly good game, it has a lot of bugs but the overall game compensates for it! THe music is back chilling and insane :D really enjoy the mods!
5679	1	a	I LIKE THIS GAME
5681	1	a	Ugh I love ARMA 3. I can't binge any game like I can ARMA 3.
5683	1	a	It's very cool game, with alot of action, there is also mod's where you can play, Real Life - Altis Life, Dayz Overpoch, Breaking point, and alot of other mods :)
5685	1	a	Arma 3 is a game I like for the vehicles and all the awesome MP games and mods, particularly Altis Life. You need a pretty beefy computer to play it well, and if you can manage that, it's a very rewarding and fun game.
5687	1	a	This game reall suprised me I plan to buy it soon and get the Breaking point mod for it.
5689	1	a	I like this game, and it's ragdoll physics are A1, 10/10 would buy again.
5691	1	a	I must say the Visuall update makes this game feel more alive and less dull! The colors pop out at you before it seemd alway like a gloomy day ! I think personnely there getting ready for the new map Tanoa wich is gonna make Arma 3 very very great! You do need Intel and Nvidia specs to play at good framerates and suggest you get nothing less then a Intel quad I5 3.5ghz and a GTX970 with SSD! higher specs would of course be better! But this is a tactical game meant to be played within squads! I suggets Wasteland or King of the Hill! Good luck !
5693	1	a	If you want a tactical game it's a game for you
5695	1	a	Went full speed down a mountain, crashed into a tree, and I exploded into pieces. 12/10 its okay.
5697	1	a	Great game, I recommend the DLC to enhance gameplay and make it more immersive. I would prefer the DLC to be free and part of the game but sadly Bethesda needs $$$ and that's the best way to get it. I'm not mad at all about buying this game and all the DLC. The developers still work on updates to the main game to add new features for better gameplay and have done an excellent job. The new APEX DLC is a must-buy because it shows the true beauty of the Arma game engine on Tanoa. 10/10
5699	1	a	this game is really fun on all the game modes but the best one that i have played by far is the epoch mod .
5701	1	a	Really nice so far.
5703	1	a	Authentic.
5705	1	a	Audio 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Action 10/10  This game is very fun and it has a lot of gamemodes, for example, wastleland wich is very action packed.  I Recommend this game!!
5707	1	a	Arma 3 Is one of the best games I have ever played. No matter what you want to do on this game you can do it, and if someone hasn't created what you want to do you can make it yourself in this game. With the Eden Editior and the countless mods in the workshop the possibilities in this game are endless.  10/10
5709	1	a	The sheer scale of the maps. The roles its crazy though Villanlia is alright. Get a few mods installed and you can have alloooot of fun with it. This is the only Milsim game ik that does a milsim better, though their are alot buggs i heard at least i persoanly have only ran into cliping issues. But its pretty good at the end of the day.
5711	1	a	Best war game out there
5713	1	a	If you like Shooting things This is the game for you
5715	1	a	We destroyed a helicopter so hard, it crashed the server  10/10
197	0	a	Perpetually broken, Horribly unoptimized and at times unplayable. Arma 3 is a game for wannabe operators that are too out of shape and cowardly to actually fight. Don't worry though you can expect plenty of cashgrab DLC like Arma 3 Karts, or the Arma 3 Two Helicopters and the rest is free DLC, or the upcoming Arma 3 Seven Guns and a bipod feature that has been missing since release DLC.   You can't blame BIS though, it's not their fault the game runs poorly the real problem is the toxic community and their poorly ported mods that cause the game to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ itself.   If you buy this half-game you can expect 100s of Altis Life RP servers, populated by 13 year old and 20 somethings that failed to launch. You could also try out one of the many KOTH servers for some low FPS deathmatches with people that can't fly, shoot, drive or communicate worth â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Don't forget the DayZ knockoff servers too, or it's tired older brother wasteland.  If you are too hardcore an operator for that though you could join one of the many 'Realism Groups'. It's like being in a real army man! Some of them even give you assigned roles and make you adress eachother by rank. If you are lucky you will find one that makes you do a virtual obsticle course or bootcamp before you can join. It's like the authentic bootcamp experience only your drill sargeant is a socially â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ teenager on such a powertrip that you would think he actually believes what he is doing isn't completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and unnecessary. Once you are in you can look forward to a mission once a week that they will restart if something goes slightly wrong in their supremely tactical plan.  3/10
5717	1	a	Buy the awesomeness called arma 3 
5719	1	a	This is truly the best game i've ever played. Buy it. You'll have a blast. I recommend that you take a little time to learn/tweak the key mapping (or if the default keys are to your liking, keep them) and do a few tutorials on weapons. There is a lot of control in this game and it can be used to your advantage. After over 300 hrs i can only think of two things that i wish were different;   MODDERS HELP US!  1- We need knives as a weapon choice. sneaking up behind a sniper while he's not watching his back... A knife would be nice....  2- I would prefer more rudder authority on the heli's or at least a sensitivity option for it. The current seems a little bit lacking in that department.(like it was set up for first time pilots to learn to fly)  All in all, I highly recommend this game and give it a BIG two thumbs up
5721	1	a	Great game with endless possibilities
5723	1	a	The greatest military sandbox I have ever played, Arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy.   Singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. It's a challenge to learn but well worth it. The main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. User-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and Zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer.    Multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. You can play it as a roleplayer, joining Life servers. You can be a survivor of the wastes in Wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. The greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. With the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. It gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling.  If you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, Arma 3 is for you.
5725	1	a	Battle royal Get a pistol a backpack an vest shoot a afk guy shoot a camper shoot another afk guy find a SMG in the biggest building killing spree! last 2 people sit in a corner until he moves near you 11/9
5727	1	a	It's vital to understand that this game is a platform. The things you can do in Arma 3 vary substantially as you explore the well made campaign, community made missions, and popular pvp game modes. Without downloading any of the amazing free mods, Arma 3 has the potential to provide some of the greatest experiences of natural vicious combat possible in gaming. When played with a microphone with or without known friends, teamwork effortlessly comes as you end up doing whatever you can to NOT DIE.   Because the game has so many options to play, you may find yourself playing boring game modes, or thrown together single player community made missions. This is why I'd like to recommend a couple ways for you to enjoy this astonishing. Creating or joining a group delving into medium to large scale COOP encounters is absolutely staggering. While some groups require entire application processes, more casual ones exist that are still incredibly fun such as Reddit's /r/ProjectAwesome. If you just wanna jump in for a a couple hours instead of scheduling events a week in advance, check out the ever present King of the Hill servers (preferably infantry only). Whatever you do, USE A MIC and DON'T BE SHY! You get from this game what you put into it so interacting with others will enhance your enjoyment tremendously.  Once you find the way you like to play here, I can promise, despite its flaws, that every facet of design will coalesce into a truly unique experience that will give you mind numbing moments you will never forget.
5729	1	a	I like the ability of custom gamemodes and mods.
5731	1	a	Love this game! just need more firends to play it!
5733	1	a	Yeah except due to other campaign glitches we cant even make it to part 2
5735	1	a	this is really great game the graphics are sexy playing with your friends is mad banter yep what more do you want?
5737	1	a	A big improvement on the previous 2. Shooting in the previous 2 games felt more like shooting a shotgun glued to the end of a broom stick. Arma 3 has a great shooting model and an actually genuinely good single player campaign.
5739	1	a	Not for the kinda person who enjoys intense fast paced action. the game requires skill and practice to be compitent and a strategic quick thinking mind is of utmost importance. install the game on an SSD aswell, when loading textures it laggs more than most games and a good SSD will remove that lag.
5741	1	a	I have logged over 100 hours on ARMA 3 and I can honestly say it has been one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had to date. The multiplayer servers feel like MILSIM and players are for the most part, willing to play the way ARMA is meant to be played. As far as campaigns go, ARMA 3 has had my favorite by far in the franchise, with an interesting story and developments in the plot, not to mention a realistic protagonist who doesn't just blindly follow orders (unless you make him because you have the choice in ARMA 3). Overall I'd give this game a 9/10
5743	1	a	Its great Buy it now.
5745	1	a	Being a big fan of Operation Flashpoint from way back when, this game is a great replacement for it.  If you are tired for the arcade style, casual, fast paced and no skill requirment of modern games. (IE: COD and BF) and want something that requires, skill, timing, know how and realism. Then this is the game for you.  Must like OP:Flashpoint, it isn't for the faint of heart at start. Lots of keys, lots of actions you need to know. But with like anything else, put the time into it and you can do it.  Huge Steam Workshop community, lots of add ons which means more FREE content. Don't like something? Make it yourself.  This game is great fun, though it may not be for all, it's great for most. Think of it as the Eve Online for shooters.  Nothing beats playing MP and being a good transport pilot to get your troops to and from battle or respawns. You can actually make a difference.
5747	1	a	there is nothing more satisfying then having a entire squadron behind you as you charge into a town filled with brigades of semi Overpowered AIs that attack you from a valid distance. weapon selection and all movement is as real as she gets
5749	1	a	*** PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW ***  Do you like army based games? Like to play realistic army games, or roleplaying at it's finest? This game is something for you then. I played for a few hours, yet the time feels like 1 hour. You lose complete track of time when you along with 50 other men try in a cooperative mission to take over a city against tanks, choppers, jets, snipers and all the other military infantries guarding it!   8/10 - Great realistic military gameplay.  *** Buy it if you like army games! ***
5751	1	a	It's Arma, not Call of Duty or Battlefield or Halo or whatever... It's simulation, so no 360quickscope, no gender-related bashing, no 'noobs vs pro' to a certain degree,   Simply one of the best simulations game in existence. It's basically a military simulations, with multiplayers and good gameplay, with multitudes of community mods. With massive content created by community, you buy this game, you could play more than just 1 game. Yeah, wanna play The Sims? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Tank Battle? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Ace Combat? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play racing games? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play... oh come on, try them for yourself! I'm not paid to write long review, so I'm gonna leave it here.   Oh, and zombies... Hehe, what's better than playing zombie in Arma themed world? Download a zombie mod, use a script to spawn tank, and have fun! 
5753	1	a	Walking Simulator! and a god damn good one! alot to do. go on and explore the amazing world of Arma3
5755	1	a	Brilliant game. I only got it because of the steam sale (at the time) other than a bit of 'clunkiness' when driving vehicles, this game is well optimised for my PC and is a genuinely pleasent experience.
5757	1	a	You can basically do anything that you want.
5759	1	a	At first the pizza was good. But then I kept eating it, and I found a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING olive on my pizza.
5761	1	a	I really liked this one from the first minute I joined the game. If you like: Playing with your squad, tactics, battle, action, teamwork, etc... --&gt; THIS IS YOUR GAME! &lt;--  And I am not going to talk about the gifted community we got that are making amazing content for all of us.  What I personally recommend: KOFH (King of the hill), Arma 3 Exile, Arma 3 Overpoch.  Don't forget to buy this game with your beloved once! And if u dont have any, you will make sum! ;)
5763	1	a	This is war! If you like military simulation games this is worth your money.
5765	1	a	What can I say other than this game is so amazing that it has stolen almost 3,000 hours of my life #nerdlife
5767	1	a	10/10 would shoot in game again.
5769	1	a	Bit Fkn Pricey M8
5771	1	a	This game is great, however you should get it with friends or join a clan right away.
5773	1	a	Got mugged because my car was blocking the road while I was getting mugged.  Would get mugged again/10
5775	1	a	-Buys awesome Nazi camo chinook. -Press Ctrl+Left shift+P To purchase the DLC to use this. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that.  -Buys a sweet Marksman Rifle to kill everyone. -Press Ctrl+Left shift+P To purchase the DLC to use this.  -Sees a gokart. -Press Ctrl+Left shift+P To purchase the DLC to use this.  Kills self.
5777	1	a	I haven't played it too much but I can safely say make some friends and make your friends get this. cause its hella more fun when you have a group to play with.
5779	1	a	I Bought this game quite a while back and i am glad i did, I Have had so much fun playing it with all the differant life servers and mods for the game. Would recomend it to anyone
5781	1	a	its da bomb....is good
5783	1	a	This game is okay, said no one ever. This game is boring, said no one ever. This game is too much like call of duty, said no one ever. The mods in this game are awful, said no one ever. This game is awesome, said everyone ever.
5785	1	a	if you like awesome army stuff then multiply by 100 = Arma3
5787	1	a	ARMA... I play the series of ARMA / Operation Flashpoint (Cold War Assault) since ... I think more then 12 years now. Of course I had some breaks, played many many other games, but I keep coming back to it again and again.   ARMA 3 is hmm, how can I say - an uncut diamond. At the moment there is a great base for the community, as there are many bugs annoying the community. We wanted it early, we got it early, so now we have to deal with the consequences - bugs, beta stadium campaign / scenarios.   It already is a great tactical shooter just like the ancessors, I give both of my thumbs up - with one pointing at Bohemia Interactive (I adore you guys) for wanting them finish the game once.
5789	1	a	This is the best game I own on the PC, and is definetily a keeper.
5791	1	a	Its arma 3 buy it
5793	1	a	it would have been my most played game if I haden't got global banned for getting my cd stolen. I still recommend it though. Lots of fun!
5795	1	a	This game looks pretty good. Played Arma 2, and was not disappointed. Looks like its time to check this game out
5797	1	a	excellent game, 10/10- excellent graphics and gameplay if you get this you must try altis life and king of the hill they are both excellent gamemodes and you get alot of action from them, Would recommend this game to anyone
5799	1	a	This game is amazing, from when I got it to now, I love playing on this Lakeside server called ProRP.
5801	1	a	Fantastic, the level editor is mostly what I do. But still. Mods are great, community is nice, everything is spot on. I also hooked up a flight stick and throttle and did tons of dogfights. It feels great. Specs are a little bit demanding too.
5803	1	a	Teleport to random places everytime while being in a passengerseat.epilepsy guaranteed   10/10
5805	1	a	This is a 1st/3rd person war simulation engine, not quite a game on its own (yet). Arma III comes with very little content on its own and it is ripe with missing features and bugs, but the guys over at Bohemia Interactive have been dilligent with patches, features, and support (There's an entire website dedicated to live bug tracking and suggestions with feedback from the developers which is incredibly rare). That being said, many users still continually suffer from lag and crashes and the game has very high requirements to run and look nicely.   Despite the missing bugs and features, the game has all the core components of a strong simulation game. The developers have done well on bullet physics and the graphics look really nice on max. On the other hand, the game is very complex and the controls will be difficult to pick up for new players. Your bullets are not lazers that hit your target immediately, you will need to range your target, adjust the sight on your gun to the appropriate distance, and lead them appropriately to have a chance of hitting them. Unless you're under 300m away, then let your inner call of duty player out.   The game's built in content consists of scenarios and the recently added campaign. The scenarios and tutorials are introductions into the various attributes of the game from flying helicopters to assault diving to artillerty strikes. The campaign feels like a bunch of scenarios strung together and adds very little to the game. All things considered, the campaign is bad and you won't want to play or remember it for long.   But you don't buy this game for the single player.  The multiplayer game modes are what put this game head and shoulders above other similar multiplayer games. Players can join a wide variety of different game modes that are downloaded and installed automatically for the player before joining the server. There are only two maps: A large map that bogs down servers with its sheer size and a smaller map that doesn't bog down the servers as much. Just like in Arma 2, there are many guides, tools, and tutorials provided and created by the community in order to produce new and diverse game modes and content. The popular DayZ mod will likely not exist in Arma 3 because of the upcoming standalone installment, but the Wasteland mode offers the same scavenging/survival mechanics sans zombies. There are also deathmatches, missions, and rpg modes to cater to every type of player.   The Call of Duty crowd would probably get bored by the slow pace of the game. The Battlefield 4 crowd will have much more common ground, but might dislike the lack of polish in the game. The Arma 2 crowd will enjoy the game.  My tips for starting to play: In any game mode, in any lobby, in any situation where you're unsure, in any situation where you have no clue what's going on, ask questions. The community is incredibly responsive and helpful. They will know the game better than you and their help will mean the difference between all your shots going right over the enemy's head or right into the enemy's head (Adjust your scope's range with PgUp and PgDown).  You should probably stay out of global voice chat (Use . and , to change your chat channel, stick to the blue team channel if you're not sure where you should be talking).
5807	1	a	Big difference over arma 2. Very fun, and can be challenging. Online play is amazing!
5809	1	a	flopped over from bullet 10/10 would flop
5811	1	a	I bought this game the beginning of the year. And i can not put it down. this game amazes me in so many ways i can not explain. From many diffrent modes of the game to the mods. i paid the full price 59.99 and it was worth every penny!
5813	1	a	Probly best military simulation shooters you could buy with out going into a real combat zone. would recomend this game to anyone!
5815	1	a	Realism above all else.   Arma 3 asks a lot of its players, but rewards them well.
5817	1	a	YES!! Absolutely and easily one of the best games ive played on PC, a must buy!!
5819	1	a	Whould cheeki for breeki again 10/10
5821	1	a	Arma 3, where do I start?   This game is the definition of realistic.   This game is the definition of freedom.   And why is it?  As you might've noticed, this is not a linear campaign shooter like Call of Duty, or Battlefield. This is the game, where you have two gigantic maps (soon a third, but as a DLC). In the base game, you ofcourse have your campaigns and all, but when the game really shines, is with its multiplayer and modding community.  In my entirety of my life, have I never seen this many mods and custom campaigns, etc. in a single game, as I have in Arma 3. It's excellent, and gives you a large variety of options on how to play. From procedurally generated open maps with the freedom of choice where to go, to the more linear - yet awesome campaigns. There's new weapons, new vehicles, even entirely new maps for you to download for free, using the Steam Workshop.  Now, about the multiplayer. When you open up your browser, you'll see a lot of the same game modes. It's a shame that there's only a few select game modes, which really made it through with Arma 3, as I remember Arma 2 had some different and awesome game modes which Arma 3 lacks. Now, if you just want to play with your friends, go ahead and create a server. You can even play with mods, and all of that custom content you've downloaded (this includes game modes, maps, etc.) to keep it fresh for you.  Now that I've talked about the good, let's talk about the bad.  The game suffers heavily from bad optimization. Now, I'm not running a monster rig, but with a GTX 770, I'm able to run every game with relative graphics. My graphics settings in Arma 3 actually don't matter that much, as my FPS remains around the same, even if I select everything on the lowest, or on ultra. If you don't have a powerful computer, or just a mid-range like me, you're in for a really bad time, and should upgrade your PC before attempting to play this game.  To be honest, I'd love to see newer vehicles and weapons from Arma 3, as most of them are wayy outdated by now. Ofcourse there's the mods, but there's not mods for every single thing.   All in all, this is a must-have if you're into military shooters (and have a good rig).
5823	1	a	All wars should be fought on ARMA.
5825	1	a	Although I like Chernarus much more than Altis and Stratis, the game itself is highly improved over ARMA 2, physics being the first thing, but not limited to it..  Movement is much more natural, and so are voices..  Would I recommend it? yes..  But it lacks the love I used to feel for Chernarus itself, the landscapes and environment in general
5827	1	a	After nearly 3700 hours into this game its the mods that I love the most.
5829	1	a	this game is just epic. just a epic war with so many mods, weapons and vehicles. the graphics are awesome and you can play with friends and make fun
5831	1	a	A brilliant game, well worth all the hundreds of hours I have poured into it, it is by no means a finished product however, there are many more improvements and features to come, but for what you get, it's well worth it!
5833	1	a	Fun and realistic combat simulator. Strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it, you can have alot of fun. I strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.
5835	1	a	I'm going to play this on my intel HD 4400! Said no one... ever...
5837	1	a	Walked for twenty minutes to car. Got hit by a rpg 100m away.  I still love this game.
5839	1	a	I once threw an assault boat into a town from a chinock and it landed on a tank and blew it up.  Buy the game...
5841	1	a	Bought the game 4 hours before the discount doubled. Still a great game. I rate in 3 Half Lifes out of 3
5843	1	a	When Operation Flashpoint came out in 2002, I was pleasantly surprized that the Bohemia Interactive Studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors. I still play it, but its successors, ARMA, ARMA2, and now ARMA 3 take this sim to new heights. As a US Army combat Veteran, I can state from my military experience that ARMA 3 tops the list of all FPS sims to date. ARMA 3 involves teamwork, self-discipline, and developing strategy to defeat the enemy. This sim is not for 'run and gun' players. 
5845	1	a	Absolutely fantastic military simulator!
5847	1	a	epic  realistic  and the altis and stratis is on greece  9/10
5849	1	a	This is the most epic fps and third person shooter game i have played defently worth getting
5851	1	a	With the full release of Arma 3 the modding community kicked into full swing releasing stellar mods like ALiVE and JSRS2. The game can be challenging and even frustrating at times if you're not patient, but rewards planning and careful engagement with an immersive and fantastic experience.  The editor gives player the ability to create their own scenarios, from simple search and clear ops to convoy ambushes and combined arms operations, and makes this game infinitely replayable.  I would definitely recommend this game.
5853	1	a	Since I started playing this, I haven't played anything else. Best game I've ever played. Great Mods like Altis Life, keep me playing for hours.
5855	1	a	the best game i have everplay for this played 2000 hours  
5857	1	a	Great game, was hesistant at first but have come to love it.  Come play TOP arma!
5859	1	a	great game but needs more optimization and the modding community makes it better.
5861	1	a	Great and possibly the most realistic war-game. With its modding capabilities it offers so much more than just a simple FPS. Highly recommended.
5863	1	a	SOF Tactical Realism
5865	1	a	The best military sim on the market, bar none.
5867	1	a	I bought it expecting my PC to handle it. It couldnt take 41 hours of island life so I went back to arma 2 for now.  Real review: Make sure your computer is good, and no the one recommended to you by the best buy geek squad for 4000 dollars wont cut it. Just build your own like me but make sure your price range is over 700 dollars, gl.
5869	1	a	Great game ! its a must buy for everyone who has some time on their hands !
5871	1	a	hard to set up and get used to at first but once you get to know it you will love it!! :)
5873	1	a	very good five out of 7 stars
5875	1	a	10/10 Would pay 60 for the game then turn around and be asked to pay another 60 for the dlc, thought I was playing battle field for a little bit. Tighten up bohemia, i can offord 120+ dollars for this game. The dlc weapons are amazing and without buying the dlc I can use them, and they are a lot better than the vanilla guns for sure. The dlc Ghillie is actually a ghillie cool enough, unlike the vanilla ghillie.
5877	1	a	Actually played a little of it, it was cool however you need god's gaming computer to run this.
5879	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fire yo
5881	1	a	ARMA SHOULD NOT HAVE DLC.
5883	1	a	One of the best games out if you ask me. If you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type BF or Call of duty where you just run around shoot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you will enjoy this game. Campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the MP is where the game shines. I personallly play on co-op servers that run Invade and Annex or Patrol Ops and its almost like playing a real war(I highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). You do get the MP servers that run stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like Wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or Atlis life(â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. Do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the VIOP to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up.  This game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a REAL war shooter that I have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. This is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! I HIGHLY recommend getting this game.
5885	1	a	-Spawn -Get in chopper -Get shot down by aimbot enemies -Repeat  10/10
5887	1	a	I love this game! I've been playing multiplayer a lot there past couple of days. If you are looking for a real military simulator this is the game for you. When you find players that will join a group with you and take the game seriously it is tons of fun. This is NOTHING like Call of Duty or even Battlefield. I would recommend this game.
5889	1	a	this is a good game and had alot of fu with it +100000000000000000 should get it 
5891	1	a	Great Game With Amazing Gamemodes!  Fun with friends and single. I bought this game and never had regrets.  Fun, Thrilling &amp; Worth It!
5893	1	a	its a great game but flying is hard and i don't know how to take off in helicopters and planes. 
5895	1	a	it is so nuch fun and flying in a heli is awesome the plans are even better the guns are awesome all i have to do is hold down the trigger
5897	1	a	very good ya
5899	1	a	It isn't a war unless there is a road march.
5901	1	a	What can I say, Its one of the best games I've ever played!
5903	1	a	Its a nice game specialy when they did arma 3 dayz mod prob lots of players should join
5905	1	a	Sure you need a budget the size of the US military's anual spending for your pc to be able to play this game, but boy is it worth it.
5907	1	a	Best game of 2014 Award goes to this withought question!
5909	1	a	this game is amazing, especially the mod altis life
5911	1	a	Seriously, just buy it. Best game.
5913	1	a	I was never a big fan of simulators let alone military simulators, but the first time I played arma 2 I fell in love. Although, I never bought arma 2 I did buy arma 3 and holy crap was it amazing. Amazing graphics, an amazing aresnal, and an amazing game. There is many glitches and long waits to do a mission, but you can see through that and notice the beauty arma 3 gives. There is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure. So, pick up a gun a helmet AND GET OUT THERE SOLIDER.
5915	1	a	An excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. Like most multiplayer games, Arma 3 works ALOT better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in Arma 3. Its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. I would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.
5917	1	a	I think this game is the best game. If u guyz getting bored in single player u should try altislife mode in multiplayer. If u guyz find the price expensive u should wait for discounts but I think this game is worth that price u should check it out   10/10   Have Fun Bros :)
5919	1	a	Best Strategy-Shooter !  buy it if you like it ;)
5921	1	a	Shot a Go Kart with a sniper Rifle and it took out a city block.   11/10
5923	1	a	This game is gorgeous. I love it. Get it as soon as you can!
5925	1	a	The Most Realistic Army Simulator! The Graphics Are Incredible And The Added Features Make It A Good Game.
5927	1	a	Just Great
5929	1	a	Not just the most realistic modern military combat simulator.  Play however you want to play.  I may not like your strange zombie survival fetish.  Or your weird ArmA streetracing when you can just go and buy an actual streetracing game.  But you can do it.
5931	1	a	10/10 became is fish
5933	1	a	Real life military simulator.  The campaign is a little hard, but it gets you used to the Arma 3 mechanics, which is basically you will die 70% of the time by 1 bullet.   The multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is at. Very time consuming, and if you find a group, you will be playing all the time. A3Launcher will be your gift from God for finding servers and automatically installing updates for online servers. Multiplayer experience can vary, as the gameplay/mods are different server to server, but it essentially consists of building a base, making money, and killing people in fun and creative ways. Some servers have zombies and roaming AI. FYI, if you came here because of the DayZ Frankie youtube videos, I would recommand watching un-blemished Arma 3 gameplay if you want to see the reality of multiplayer.
5935	1	a	Better than counter-stroke.
5937	1	a	10/10
5939	1	a	This game is amazing you must get it
5941	1	a	Amazing game! The Life mod also changed and bringed a lot of RPG + RP lovers to buy this game.
5943	1	a	Yes it is
5945	1	a	This game is so good it makes my â™¥â™¥â™¥ sizzle
5947	1	a	Stay low, go fast. Kill first, die last. One shot, one kill. No luck, all skill.
5949	1	a	  Played it with a friend and is worth all the money they ask for! so many gamemodes so big map so fun experience
5951	1	a	This game is good and a lot of fun with friends money is a bit hard to get some times.But if you play this enjoy it.
5953	1	a	My friend and I have both loved this game! I'd also recommend checking up on the launch arguments for optimization. If you read up on the game you'll find out that it's heavily run on a single CPU core (so you need a fast processor). But using the multithreaded launch options and other arguments to the startup can help you run it better  My favorite moment in this game has been walking around at night and hearing 'allahu akbar' through my speakers then a thunderous 'BOOM' through my subwoofer from off in the distance. My friend said 'Rebel, lets get involved!' Craziness obviously ensued!
5955	1	a	Best of it's kind! Still a bit buggy but great fun and everything is possible! :D
5957	1	a	Great game.
5959	1	a	If you are into military scenarios, this game is great for you. With the new engine and actual physics aspects, it takes a big leap forward for the Arma series. For me, it has been an amazing trip from Alpha into the upcoming release, an was not in any way a dissapointment. I can't wait for jets :D
5961	1	a	Great game, if your a fan of Bohemia it's a must have!
5963	1	a	Game is very fun. Very realistic shooter game with many different community made game modes. I recommend getting some mods such as tactical battlefield or arma 3 life
5965	1	a	So fun, and at time realistic. Mods for world war two, vietnam, RPG mods the content is unlimited! Best purchase I've made thus far!   10/10  
5967	1	a	10/10 would play on my toaster again.
5969	1	a	Great Game! Tons of gamemodes and tons of things to do. The campaign is awesome along with the multiplayer. I would reccomend this game! 10/10
5971	1	a	Awesome game here it has so much more potential than games such as cod or battlefield which are mainluy liniar games on arma theres no straight line thinking its like a giant sandbox with huge maps and vast mods and gamemodes to suit everyone. I would suggest this to anyone thats on the fence about the game or prefers a break away from Cod and battlefield a solid 10/10 from me
5973	1	a	Very good game, perfect resolutions, and nice settings, the game is fun to play, awesome, chillin' with friends, but lots of glitches that needed to be fixed.
5975	1	a	Really nice game.. Beautiful aswell. Just the campaign made me rage xD 
5977	1	a	Bought Arma 3 a few days ago,and now this 50% off while I bought full price RIP.
5979	1	a	Kinda like warcraft 3 no one buys it for the actual game its all about the mods.
5981	1	a	It's not bad.
5983	1	a	I used to play CoD and Battlefield series and now I make fun of them. I used to think that no game will ever reproduce the chaos and unpredictability of war and I was wrong. I used to have a social life that has now been replaced by intense firefights and military operations of all kinds. ArmA is not a game like the others, it will bring war straight into your living room and it will show you all sides of it: brutal cruelty, the high price to pay for mistakes and the importance of teamwork and communication to achieve the objective. The Community content is huge and if you learn how to do it, there is no real limitation on what you can do as far as mission building and content go. The only regret I had when I first discovered this game was that I wish I had known it before.
5985	1	a	Be me  Sees TM get shot runs to him drags him out off fire carries him 5 km After that  Flys in osprey osprey got shot down im on ground some chinese girl helps me and my teammates i see teammate on the ground drag him to humwe this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GREAT BUY IT  
5987	1	a	This game is:  C ool A amazing N ew C reative E ducational and R ad!!
5989	1	a	War is fought by soldiers not the gun, it is fought by a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tank coming down a road while you have you're pistol of doom. Ps no pants have been harmed in the making of this game
5991	1	a	this game is very good u should get it 
5993	1	a	Finally a game worth spending my hard earned $60 on. A fun game! Hate it when I take a bullet in the head, But hey, thats realism!
5995	1	a	There's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though, Arma 3's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges, but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.
5997	1	a	10/10 i really like this
5999	1	a	Typical Arma: Getting better all the time. Some of the mods and addons are so clever you could be forgiven for thinking it's Arma4 not 3 ... Already with steam workshop mods and addons ranging from simple missions to mind-blowing fully scripted conversions - there are always going to very large amount of mods and missions thanks to the familiar and easy to learn mission editor (easy to learn, hard to master), plus ArmaTools for free. Top quality addons from the community being added all the time- and you can use your other Arma/Arma2/OA/Iron Front/TOH content via a mod called AllInArma.  As in all the previous Arma mil-sims, eventually hardware and mid range systems are catching up to it about the same time community content gets slick and plentiful (as it is now for Arma2).   Underwhelming as a pie down the trousers on first release, but turning into an great game.
6001	1	a	As soon as I launched this game for the first time I fell in love with it. Arma 3 takes all of the things that Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead had, and improved on it twice over. First off, Altis is gigantic. Stratis is smaller in size, but it's still impressively large. I've played this game for over 70 hours and I've yet to see the entirety of the map. The whole arsenal meaning the clothes, backpacks, weaponry and vehicles are simply amazing. While the controls are a bit simulator-ey it doesn't take very long for you to figure out the controls, and before you know it, you'll know all the necessary controls to play efficiently.   One thing that I do not really care for is the stamina system, mostly because I feel like my character can have a rifle, a pistol and 2 mags for each and after running 200 metres he would be gasping for air on the side of the road.   The developers let you play the dlc as much as you like for free, but you get a big advertisment on your screen once in a while which has from what I've seen messed up a lot of peoples shots. I don't know if they're done with dlc yet or not, but when they are done with it, I hope to see a gold edition or something so I can buy all of the dlc for less.   If you have a pc that can run this game, buy it.
6003	1	a	yeah its good in everything it does. kinda a bummer that dlc is so expensive when its a mil sim and u would expect what is in the dlcs to be in the game standard unlike arma 2 had dlcs that were new games by them selves
6005	1	a	10/10
6007	1	a	With mod tools, lean, serious communities supported by dedicated servers, Arma 3 will satisfy veteran PC gamers used to all the amenities that so many franchises dropped, because the game stays true to its roots yet innovates in such a way that expands the possibilities, but does not limits them.
6009	1	a	LOVE HOW IT CRASHES EVERY 5 MINUTES. WANT $60 BACK 
6011	1	a	IF you never played operation flashpoint, arma 1 , arma 2 , day z mod , day z standalone, or any other military shooter this game is not for you and if you have, this is the best military simulator ever made.
6013	1	a	CUP addons fixed nearly every complaint I had with this game. Still poorly optimized, but that's ARMA for you.
6015	1	a	Amazing. Graphics are very realistic. The Game play itself will be hard to grasp at first however after you have gotten the hang of it, it can indeed be very rewarding as well as realistic. Overall in general i would recommend arma to anyone who wants a true sandbox playground to engage in different military situations and other community made missions.
6017	1	a	After being eaten by some random house walls in battle royale couple of times you realise that this game is better then Call Of Duty.  9/11
6019	1	a	Wait for ACE and ACRE. The minute they both drop I'll be on Arma 3 for days.
6021	1	a	Arma 3 is essentially just a major improvement over the last, while also having different enough experiences to be worth buying as an Arma veteran. With the amount of content that is currently available in this game I can't not recommend it, and the existing content really is a lot of fun. This being said I have almost exclusively played single player and koth so I'll critique those.  Probably the best thing about this game to me is the single-player, and it's because it capitalized on the parts of Arma 2's campaign that were fun, but really short and mostly just filler garbage. All of this game's missions are short-burst, short-term little missions that revolve around an objective and have you return to the main hub once finishing, akin to scenarios in Arma 2, other than the fact that the missions are connected. This really was the best way the campaign could've been approached since this game is praised for its gameplay and doing something as nonscripted as the Arma 2 campaign just isn't interesting enough to play, and people who liked Arma 2's singleplayer rarely compliment it. Because of that, I think the singleplayer alone would be enough to buy this game if one doesn't really like Arma 2's campaign but they enjoyed the gunplay and gameplay.  Multiplayer's kinda what you'd expect from this series, with the Arma Life roleplaying still going strong and a few other really fun gameplay modes like Wasteland (sandbox Arma pvp), and I'd strongly recommend getting this game if you're a fan of sandbox or rp stuff in Garry's Mod, or Minecraft, or DayZ/Unturned (any sandbox game is comparable to this game other than the combat, which makes this an interesting multiplayer game if you're into that stuff) since they're similar. Something recently incorporated by the devs of this game is koth (King of the Hill), where you go into cities from a base and siege it with manpower. It was a really nice change in pacing for this game, since it's largely controlled by you (the pacing) and it appeals to more of the singleplayer fans that like the siege reconnaissance Arma 2 represented, as well as taking different roles at or away from the battlefield, like the snipers and field medics, as well as the breachers and pilots and all that (which are supported by a perk and character system that I thought were cool for roleplaying). It's hard to say if I'd buy this game for one gamemode, but the amount of options really gives you the liberty to choose what you enjoy the most and explore the content there.  Overall, this game has a really solid singleplayer and multiplayer compared to most as well as previous editions in Arma, and the release that is this game is justified to buy based on its content additions and a newer (and clunkier) control scheme that compliments this game better than Arma 2's did, and overall improvements to the fun of this series. I'd recommend it to you if you enjoyed sandbox/rp stuff or milsim, or if you're a fan of the series already.
6023	1	a	IMO this game it so cool, i can be a soldier without joining a military. but this game it's so expensive ;-;
6025	1	a	Ok so to start things off, this game is by far the best millitary shooter I have ever played (and I have player ALOT). From the stunning realistic graphics, to the most realistic comat you can in a game, makes for this game to be a really fun, exiting and realistic combat.  This game takes millitary combat to a whole new level, it's massive open world landscpae provides for some hectic battles, from classic dogfights, to jets droping bombs on you, to sniping down your foes, to even just doing the classic gunsblazings tactic you'll never get board of.  So do I think this is a good game, ABSOLUTLY, and I 100% reccomand checking this out if you like a good old millitary shooter, and yet there is so much more I haven't talked about yet, and I'll leave that part up to you.  11/10: MUST GET NOW, JUST LEGIT GET IT, NOW, RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have a great time out there on the field, soldiers... DISMISSED!!!
6027	1	a	This is the best military simulator and there is so much content for the game you could play a new thing every day for the rest of your life it just all around an amazing game
6029	1	a	a game really worth getting if your to mod it or just chill in the wasteland servers or just go on king of the hill
6031	1	a	If your into war games this is the one. Realistic and lots of fun with friends.
6033	1	a	Best army/game ever to date! If you have not got it yet, go get it now!
6035	1	a	Extremly fun and dynamic game with endless opportunity. Yet the DLC's are so expensive its isnane and any servers with DLC items, vehicles etc spam your screen constantly to buy it. Love the game but the DLC's are overpriced at $40 for a new map and a few vehicles like thats over the top
6037	1	a	Arma 3 is the game that will leave you endlessly for hours on end fighting and just overall enjoying the scenery! Arma 3 is the next gen Military Simulator by Bohemia Interactive and features over 500+ Units,Aircraft,Vehicles and weapons and many more goodies ingame. Arma 3 is worth buying!
6039	1	a	Has its bugs here and there but the fact its crafted for modular addition gameplay is what i love about it.
6041	1	a	This game is by far the best first person shooter so far. much better than some of the other games out there.   I HIGHLY recommend this game.
6043	1	a	Best tactical/realistic warfare game of our time. I absolutely enjoy Altis Life.
6045	1	a	This game is the definition of greatness. The graphics and physics of the game are amazing! Though the game is not easy to get used to, this game is a must play for anyone that like brutal unforgiving combat and realistic gameplay. 
6047	1	a	If u dont like fast paste fps games, but you like games that are slow paste tactical sneaky beaky stylish games, this game is for you.    Pros    - Great graphics - fun to play - very tactical game - customizable weapons etc - ingame map editor - mod support +++++ - very well created tutorials - multiplayer support - etc    Cons    - only and the biggest complain about this game is the fps, you gotta have good pc if you want to run this game on high. ofcourse you can do some tweaking that will give u little fps boost but still fps is not the greatest
6049	1	a	its ok
6051	1	a	One of the all time greatest military sims. Arma 3 is a game for you that are tierd of short matches, on maps where you can snipe another player from the other side, and kids raging. The game gives you the possibility to try out many sorts of warfare from squad leader to tank commander.  The one thing Arma 3 lacks is a propper physics engine, tanks are not supposed to do sommersaults!  Other then that I whould recommend Arma 3 to anyone that wishes for big maps and loads of diffrent gear. Buy the Apex Edition! ;)
6053	1	a	Very fun game. Alot of game modes like Battle Royale. Wasteland and other stuff. Buy it NOW WHEN ITS -50%
6055	1	a	 Bottom line:   Necessary investment
6057	1	a	I went online, ended up in a Go-Kart with a HMG on top, and then getting a nuke and exploding everywhere from hitting a small rock with a gokart.   10/10 GOTAY
6059	1	a	Really good
6061	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game that deserves more attention. The only downside, is that you need a Jet Engine to run this game.  10/10
6063	1	a	it is the best game i have ever played and i am glad to have it.
6065	1	a	Arma 3 what is there to do?  There is many things you can do on Arma 3, here is just a quick list of things you can do and get...  1. There are role-playing servers 2. Wasteland servers where everyone fights to the death 3. There is a ton of mods you can get for this game  4. A lot of friendly people 5. Can make your own server for free!!  6. Not a lot of hackers because this game has top scripters who prevent them  So there was a quick list of things you can do and get.   Do I recommend this game?  Yes I do because this game is top knotch it has incredible views, two big maps. fun game modes you can play, and tons of mods!  Here is how you can create a server for free:  http://youtu.be/E3ubmiGdPVs   Thank you for viewing this review!
6067	1	a	:D Game is worth it
6069	1	a	Brilliant game, graphics A1, audio A1, gameplay perfection, couldnt possibley be a better combat game currnetly on the market
6071	1	a	Pretty damn good, make for sure you have a good gaming PC before buying.
6073	1	a	Looks great for an alpha build. Lots of community content in the workshop. And the first Dlc/mission due soon. Great graphics etc (if your pc can handle it). 9/10
6075	1	a	Best LIKE REAL gameplay! When you hear bullets pass over---- puts you in a place where you never think you be in.
6077	1	a	11/10
6079	1	a	Such milsim, many games, much fun, so ARMA.
6081	1	a	 Arma 3 is one of the most advanced, cumbersome, fun and stunning games I've ever played
6083	1	a	Arma 3 itself has an amazing campaign, with a flowing storyline and plenties of moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice acting isn't world class, but in this sort of game there's plenty else that's going to be taking your attention and immersing you in the story. The online is this game's highlight though, with an active community and a fairly easy to use scenario maker, people have really put some time and effort into making the best gamemodes and scenarios for you and your friends to try out. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for someone to eat into their time budget, because you'll find yourself playing this game for hours. Whether you're into immersing yourself into a mil-sim multiplayer mode, or out to cut down waves of zombies on mods like Breaking Point, this game is for you. Plenty to do, lots of fun to be had, thumbs up!
6085	1	a	It's a running simulator where AI can see through smoke, insta kill you when they are in a vehicle but when on foot they don't know how to hold a gun. And don't try to remember all the keybinds you just can't...
6087	1	a	if you want a game game where teamwork is the only solution to any problem, then look no further.
6089	1	a	Just from playing this game alone, I could probably fly a helicopter better than I can drive a car.
6091	1	a	i've pondered purchasing this game many times over the last year. i've never played an arma title. i REGRET not purchasing it the first time it crossed my mind.
6093	1	a	Great game, fun to play with friends, campaign is alright, many great game modes to play on and many great mods to choose from. Rate: 8/10
6095	1	a	If you are into millitary simulators, this is the game for you. I would pay 10x what this game cost just to play it!
6097	1	a	BEST GAME EVER..... HELICOPTERS CAR ATV A VAST RANGE OF WEAPONRY
6099	1	a	Although ARMA 3 offers a diverse amount of game types and a wide selection of mods, if you are looking for fast paced 'shoot-em-up' play style this game is not for you. A typical night in ARMA can involve long periods of boredom interspersed with some of the most intense firefights possible in a video game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in a more realistic military shooter or someone that is looking to enjoy one of the many alternate gametypes/mods that ARMA offers.
6101	1	a	It has it's flaws, but, Arma 3 for me is still possibly the finest war game out there.  This game is one for the gamers though, casual players be warned. Arma has always and hopefully always will have a tough learning curve. Enemies are accurate and deadly on even the easiest settings and the control system is complicated enough to make your head explode. From the numerous controls for simply running around, leaning around corners, commanding troops and changing optical sights, to the things like zeroing your sights and ranging up targets, Arma will have you confused for awhile.  Stick with it though and learn the game and you will realize you have to act like a soldier to survive.  Unlike many fps's, you simply cannot get away with blitzing around, guns blazing. Shots need to be accurate, cover is your only life saver and good use of tactics and planning will win out over Rambo-ing your way through. This makes for a wonderful game, very different to the majority of other games out there and a stand alone in terms of war simulation.  Is it war? No. Is it far closer than anything like Battlefield / CoD / Heroes and Generals etc....Yes, by a long long way.  Online is much the same thing, although, people tend to be a little worse than Ai's so you can get away with a little more. Some of the mod's of this game alone have gone on to warrant their own games (DayZ), which for me shows how different this game is compared to the rest of the market. A mod of this game is different enough to anything else out there, it got it's own stand alone game, not many other titles can say that.  Playing online isn't always easy. Skill is generally going to win out and that can be tough sometimes if you play online and are new to the game. The mod's (such as epoch), that start you with no gear can more be about finding the right server sometimes. I'm currently playing on two different servers, one is very full and packed full of people just wanting to kill you on sight, no warning, no nothing. The other is a generally quiet server, very friendly and much more survivor feeling. Both other great game play experiences, but of a very different nature. One has you avoiding anywhere built up and laying low a lot until you manage to get a weapon, then you start looking for oppurtunities to pinch gear and hold people up. The other has you heading into built up areas hoping to find vital equipment such as building materials, food, drink and weapons. You look to help others out and often find yourself leaving your safety to help those in need.    Now, the game isn't perfect. Time to talk flaws.  Bugs. There are a decent handful of bugs. I had one mission in the main game that all the cars spawned into the floor and I couldn't complete the mission (as part of the mission was to drive one of the said cars to a location).  Another had my artillery support stop working....leaving me to try and take out 4 tanks and about 2 dozen people with what amounted to sticks and stones.  Restarting these levels from scratch fixed both, but, can be tough to swallow if you found it a struggle getting that far the first time.  Online has bugs too. Climbing over stuff or falling a foot or two from something can sometimes result in injury. Doors will sometimes decide they will no longer work and will either not close or not unlock. A restart of the server (most restart every 4 hours) usually solves that problem though. Vehicles can simply despawn and lose you a lot of gear. The servers tend not to remember a lot of what goes on in the last 3-4 mins before a restart.  With most of the bugs in this game though, they are patched fairly quickly and although frustrating, aren't deal breakers for me. You're not required to own the DLC either to play on servers that have that DLC running (or so I was told) which is good value for money if you're thinking of being more an online player.    Overall, I'd give Arma 3 a 9/10 ........ Bugs removed, a larger single player set of campaigns and perhaps some slightly better optimising (which isn't bad) would push it to a 10.
6103	1	a	Love it. 10/10. Uses tons of cpu, wish it would use gpu more instead.
6105	1	a	Extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or KOTH, recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! I plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! Quite and amazing amount of detail in the game, sometimes im amazed at the littlest things I see in game.
6107	1	a	My experience- I have over 1500 hours invested between all of the Arma versions, and their mods. more than half of that I spent playing Arma 3, on Epoch and Exile servers.  The mods really do make these games come alive, but if it wasnt for the awesome Dev team and massive amount of content available with the vanilla game, the community as we know it wouldnt exist. I have never shared so many different emotions playing one game, Anger, fear, frustration, joy and curiousity as I let my imagination write a tale every time I log in. Of course your gaming experience will vary depending what type of mod you are playing, but thats just another great asset this game has, you can literally go from a battlefield 4 style game mode with 100+ players on a simply massive map, to a zombie survival in a wasteland, or strugling to survive as a prisoner recently dropped into a unkown island.  If you are looking for THE military simulator, that simply has it all and then some.. this is it.  The learning curve is steep, and there isnt much forgiveness from veteran players, but how you handle being thrown into the fire is up to you. Did I mention the modding community? because its insane, literally everything you wanted to create or play your own custom server is here, from base building, crafting, farming, flying, weapons, vehicles, maps, npcs etc etc etc the list is endless.  Currently I have been playing Exile servers with my Wife, there is persistent base building, missions, trading, looting, raiding, crafting and much more. Eventually you find the community that fits your play style and thats when you really get addicted. PVE/PVP, Roaming AI, Vehicles etc there are thousands of persistent servers running hundreds of variations of each mod, and almost all have very active players and admins.    No Doubt 10/10
6109	1	a	Best simulator game. Like the combat beside the movement when you prone but the game and grapich is amazing.
6111	1	a	10/10 real life simulator in a third world Country.
6113	1	a	Great Game, But I want to get it so i need it to be cheaper 
6115	1	a	Best military simulator you can find! 9.5 out of 10!
6117	1	a	Its a great game but you do need someone to teach you the basics because its pretty complex. The only major bad thing is when you shoot at someone and they die its very awkward, if you dont know what i mean watch some youtube videos about arma 3 and watch people die awkwardly
6119	1	a	Realistic, Fun, and easy to play when you know simulators. 10/10 
6121	1	a	Arma 3... Sometimes really fun and sometimes very annoying.   But better than any other Arma game in the world.   Really fun when you mod it or join a Taskforce  (TF163) :P
6123	1	a	Arma 3 is one of my favorite games of all time. My bro and I were looking for a coop military game with customization and this is it. If you've ever dreamed of making your own military scenerios that you can play with a friend, then this game is a godsend. Arma 3 is the reason I game on PC.
6125	1	a	oMg so realistic even the grases moves unlike cod lol buy the premium edition for your special skull camo and ac-130 killstreak (Srsly tho it is a good game get if you think your graphics card wont melt on ultra lul)
6127	1	a	Best game for team work and endless fun. Great graphics too, but you need a beasty system though to enjoy max settings. CPU hungry
6129	1	a	Great for Individual play and for large group play. Great DLC's and many gamemodes.
6131	1	a	damn this is is my new drugs, #LUKATDEMHRSONREKORTSON
6133	1	a	It's an awesome game!Dude, the gamemodes, oh my god.You really need to play this game, IT'S AWESOME!
6135	1	a	Awesome game, I bought it for the life servers like Altis life and Arma 3 life and servers like that because thats what I find the most fun. Definitely recommend it 100%!
6137	1	a	Great game. A must buy for anyone looking for a great simulation first and or third person shooter. Overall great game you will not be disappointed. 
6139	1	a	10/10 Beautiful game. I could get lost for hours.
6141	1	a	I like the realism that his game has.
6143	1	a	Arma 3 is the new age tactical shooter with more addons to enhance your game.
6145	1	a	One of the best and must have game on PC, it doesn't matter if you like Millitary sim or not. Arma 3 with its mods has something especial just for you. I've been playing this game since alpha and still find something new to play and enjoy.
6147	1	a	Realistic bullet drop, Too much wind sounds, Realistic Terrain, Custom Gamemodes, This is like Garry`s Mod but merges with Battlefield, Funny Players, Easy to fly a Jet but hard to land, LARGE MAP IS GOOD.  Should you buy this game? YES. wait... idk someone gave it to me :|
6149	1	a	Arma 3  The soldier stalks his prey, carefully aiming his rifle The prey turns around Get shot in the face Rage quit Arma 3 Break computer with sledgehammer Repeat 5 times, until you realise Arma 3 isn't Call of Duties or TF2  11,000/10 would smash again
6151	1	a	With the amount of Community support, this game is a must buy.
6153	1	a	Never played it and I honestly don't know why I was able to write this review but it looks fun
6155	1	a	Im going to be completely Honest, I bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. As such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. I can say though that if you like or enjoyed ARMA style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. The controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. Every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag I blame and curse over the microphone as I mourn my body. If you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, I would recomend giving this series a try. I did not mind spending the money and I bought this before the summer sale. I would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with ARMA series titles (Look at the dayz mod)
6157	1	a	Hard, challenging, frustrating, annoying, impossible, infuriating, still my favorite game
6159	1	a	the best game i ever playd
6161	1	a	Great game 9.5/10 Don't give this a ten because of these reasons  Fps is iffy  The bushes are made of metal Thats legit it  Heres the Good things Great guns Great cars Great models Great animations Great Game in all :D  in the end its worth the money but if you're running a not so good pc idk if you should get it since the fps tends to drop at certain moments
6163	1	a	Very Nice, Fun with Friends
6165	1	a	i Love This Game :-)
6167	1	a	Mods and more mods. THis game is just fantasic.
6169	1	a	Really good game, recommend for you to buy it. The game has extremely good graphics that make it look realistic. Once the game is out of Alpha/Beta, there will be a lot more vehicles such as airplanes. I would give this game a rating of 8.5/10 as of now.
6171	1	a	I do recommend this game. This game is great and is very fun. I don't play multiplayer so I won't be talking about that nor do I care about graphics for those of you who only care about the graphics. I personally love open world games and open ended games. So there are quite a few missions that I love and those include Robj's missions and whole lotta altis. I don't really have any complaints because I don't look for problems in games, I just play it and appreciate getting to play games.
6173	1	a	10/10
6175	1	a	It's ok.
6177	1	a	  It's a pretty fun game. I didn't really get much time to play, but every second I played, I enjoyed. It was surely fun. The multiplayer is fun with the roleplaying servers and CO-OP. If you are really into military games not too far back in time and not futuristic, then this is the game for you. Graphics are great. These are not the best of the best but I'm actually surprised about how good it is still. Audio is great too. Some multiplayer players are really some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that constantly taze you for no reason on roleplaying servers. But I still had a blast playing it! Good job Bohemia Interactive  
6179	1	a	Really good game
6181	1	a	what more can be said about arma? well not much. the base game is good, i went more into the modded games and to be honest its a shame the way things have gone in the modding community. the only one i can say i enjoy at this point is the exile mod. those guys are doing some great things and hopefully will continue too. so manny of the modders all have got a attitude 'this is my mod, you cant use it' its actually sad. Then you got the game creator that hasnt helped the situation at all. at this point there are other games out now that i would recomend over this but it does still have some good points.
6183	1	a	Big fan of arma! buy the apex version, its cheaper and everyone uses DLC so might as well
6185	1	a	Hey, that's pretty good.  *Edit* RIP life
6187	1	a	My favorite game of all time is also a flawed mess. Let me explain.  Similar Games: Insurgency, Operation Flashpoint, Battlefield (in some respects)  Pros -Unforgiving hardcore tactical gameplay. -Realistic damage model. -Intense, Cinematic firefights that will have you at the edge of your seat and get your adrenaline pumping. -Co-op and PvP is amazing in this game if you play with the right people. -Has one of the most dedicated modding communities I have ever seen. -Easy to mod. -Many official and fan made gamemodes that are a blast to play. (Favorites: King of the Hill, CTI, Liberation, Insurgency) -Detailed open world enviroments. -Destructible buildings. -Overall a fairly welcoming community. -Dynamic gameplay, hardly anything is scripted. -Combined Arms gameplay. -Variety of roles to fill within a squad. (Ex: Medic, Sniper, Grenadier, etc.) Vehicular combat is also a thing. (Tanks, planes and helos are all included.) -Large scale battles among varied enviroments. (some modes simulate an enemy army moving along the map.) -Easily the best co-op game of all time. -The game is in constant development, with updates on nearly a monthly basis fixing issues and adding improved mechanics. The dev team seems to listen to requests of the community as well.  Cons -VERY steep learning curve. (You will get destroyed a lot when you begin.) -Bugs. Many Bugs, mainly collision issues which can be problematic, especially during PvP modes. Getting stuck on objects is common in this game. -Performance varries and is hardly based on your PC specs. (Most of the performance issues in the game are due to slow server speed and the amount of AI/Players that are accounted for at any given time during a game. The faster the server is the higher the FPS.) -Single player can be really dry. You will get hardly anything out of the game if you only play single player. -Clunky UI that takes some getting used to. This has been improving. -AI varries in intelligence and reaction time. This has been improved in the recent updates, but it is still pretty bad. -Only for a certain audience. -Some of the animations look rediculous.   Overall  I have had a fantastic time with this game. It is a clunky mess, but at the same time there is no game on the market that provides the same amount of freedom as well as tense, heart pounding gunfights that Arma does. However, the barrier to entry is so high, I think the only way to enjoy this game is to know someone or even better, a group of people, who play it regularly to show you the ropes. If you try to get into this game in any other way, you will have an absolutely miserable time. As I may have said earlier, a huge aspect of this game is the Co-op and if you play with people you don't like your opinions on the game will follow suit. Another thing to consider, is how niche the game is. Research and/or try before you buy.  10 out of 10 -As contradictory as this verdict might be considering all the problems this game has I cannot deny the amount of enjoyment I have gotten out of this game so far and the several hundred hours more to come out of it in the near future.  This game is for: Players seeking a tense, challenging, stress indusing, tactical shooter to play in cooperation with other like minded people.
6189	1	a	This game has taught me one beautiful lesson, 'You'll never know how bad you suck at being a soldier until you try.'
6191	1	a	still a bit buggy, but a lot of fun though.
200	0	a	Ok where too start, the game is fun and if you have a group of friends even better, now with that said the game is laggy and when i say laggy i mean very laggy. I'm running a 290x with an 8320 asrock mobo and it still can't run this game you want too know why, they don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you got it now your stuck with it, they don't fix anything just save your money and get something else maybe if you have an intel it may run better but my brother have intel and you know what he can't run it either so don't get it i'm telling you right now you will be sorry. And what's sad is i love the game when i can play it, it's a good game but oh man does it suck
6193	1	a	Great game. Great dlc. Best running simulator 2k16 and beyond. Mods for this game are great aswell
6195	1	a	i was on the fence about this game thinking it was gonna be like another call of duty. So i held out, watched twitch and read reviews. Finnaly the game went on sale and i decided to buy it. I almost regret not getting it sooner. This game is addicting
6197	1	a	A game for those operators who operate operationally in operations
6199	1	a	This is a good buy but be warned it is not like ArmA 2 and does not have as much content. The devs have almost seem to let the modding comuunity to take over the content. Also here is a list of bad:    1) ArmA 3 is not optimized for AMD players in multiplayer. I can turn my graphics from low to high and still get 25 fps on all of them when i play multiplayer. My friends who actaully has a GTX card can only get 30-35 fps, but switch it over to the campaign or editor mode and fill it with crap I can run 40-60 on standard both maps. 2) Go mess around in ArmA 2 then go to ArmA 3 there is so little content available in ArmA 3. I mean you had ever type of weapon on a humvee from a m249lmg to a TOW laucher and so did the other light vehicles. The weapons there was at least 30 base weapons giving awesome customization. vs what 5 or 6 that really the only wirthwhile thing that can change is the sights. 3) No bipods great mill sim there (Dayz has a bipod) 4) The inentory system is a bit wonky to me but maybe that is just me. 5) Steep learning curve 6) AI will kill you with one shot from a 9mm pistol when they are on the otherside of the town. 7) AI can take 3-6 bullets from your standard issued MX rifle that shoots a 6.2mm (Battle rifle basically) 8) Vehicle warfare is boring since even the tanks can't take but one rocket before they are critically damaged (And most launchers lock onand you can not block the lock)
6201	1	a	Top shooter of all time, and developers keep on improving it.  I can't deny there are LOTS of bugs to be fixed, but it's still the best milsim game around.
6203	1	a	Well I purchased this game because of the exile mod thinking it would make a nice change of scenery, I was correct it is a very addicting game although the little bugs like driving a atv into a bush will kill you, dying in a house due to a millimeter gap between the wall and floor are annoying if you can look past it i'm sure you will very much enjoy it as a bonus there is a stupid amount of mods/maps/server to play, so you can always get something that you are looking for.
6205	1	a	This is my review on ARMA 3:  Pros: +Huge modding community +Loads of guns +Many different scopes +Quite a lot more but currently can't remember.  Cons: -Community can be cancerous at times -Game is CPU dependent meaning that if you have a crap CPU but good GPU you're in for a fun time  Hopefully performance shouldnt be an issue when Apex comes out as it will include the DX12 upgrade which is free.
6207	1	a	I love this game! :D
6209	1	a	It is pretty good. With even only low settings on, it is beautiful. Have only really played Exile and Life mods though. Great game, give it a 1000/1000
6211	1	a	By far the best game I have ever played. Perfect for anyone who loves milsim and playing with serious people.
6213	1	a	Modding community for it is great. Plenty of game modes so you'll never get bored. Bohemia is constantly updating it (though oftentimes their updates fix one thing but break something else)
6215	1	a	To get dayz all you need to do is pull down your pants and bend over, if a pistol comes out of your butt you will receive your own copy of dayz :D awesome game btw
6217	1	a	its a yes from me
6219	1	a	  Love this game to bits, love battle royale, love the coop, love all the gamemodes. But this game is buggy af. I keep getting crashes so buy with caution.
6221	1	a	Great game, different mods, such as wasteland / king of the hill.  Really enjoyable   Badly optimized (FPS) 
6223	1	a	Have you ever played a modern/futuristic (Arma 3 is in the middle, it's in 2035, not that futuristic after all) FPS war game with a full-scale war? If you haven't then please play this game, 3D art is done fantastically well, the game lets you control almost everything, there is a wide variety of vehicles and weapons you can drive and shoot, however it was one of the most difficult campaigns i have ever played, it took me 47 hours to complete with skipping ~6 missions if i remember precisely because they were too difficult, if you are coming from cod or bf you will have a hard time transitioning into arma, but it is totally worth the time, at sometimes the AI was acting a bit stupid but not as much as arma 2. Unfortunately those AI moments where the soldiers used cover were scripted, but hell, the atmosphere, I've never experienced something as cool as this. The game takes place on 2 beautifull greek islands, Agios Efstratios (mentioned as stratis in-game) and Lemnos(mentioned as altis in-game). The storyline was also good, instead of being the typical world savior you are a normal soldier who takes part on a war, nothing more or less, you'll love it though.   I have to mention a funny incident that happened during gameplay: I am a greek citizen and i have to point out that cicadas show up during the summer, and you don't usually build a fire in the summer during day time... something that some soldiers were doing in the game. Looking forward to arma 4 being released, im sure it will be as good as arma 3 and maybe even better (maybe better optimised than arma 3 since it does not sympathize amd cpus). That's it, amazing game overall.
6225	1	a	  its a good game
6227	1	a	Really refined compared to Arma 2, they did a lot of work, and the campaign is well written and a pleasure to play. UI is cleaned up, mechanics are mastered and smoothed, and gameplay is a lot more immersive. Great moves Bohemia, keep it up.
6229	1	a	Great game! Can not begin to tell you how many fun times I have had. You should get it for sure. You will get many fun memories for the price you pay.
6231	1	a	This game is honestly one of the best game you'll ever play, i can barely run it (15-30fps) yet i had so much fun, you have a high end intel processor, you'll have a great time.
6233	1	a	Amazing game with many biggest mods!!
6235	1	a	I played it a bit. It's okay.
6237	1	a	It's a great game with friends in wasteland Altis life and king of the hill
6239	1	a	DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO GO MULTIPLAYER. UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST A 3.5GHZ INTEL i5   The game itself is a very nice realistc game with many weapons and attachments, many vehicles, many unique features and 2 GIGANTIC maps (about 300kmÂ²).  BUT:  -Multiplayer FPS still not optimized (was promised) -Collision-Detection still not improved (its obvious that something is wrong with a 3d game where you cant jump) -AMD Hardware optimization not even began.... (15-30 FPS in multiplayer...they couldnt care less bout AMD users) -AI is a not-so funny joke -Ground-vehicle behaiviour is far away from being realistic or enjoyable (they obvious tried both and failed) -Official Servers????? NOPE!!!!! -Matchmaking????? NOPE!!!!!  -CoOp play singleplay campaign?????? NOPE!!!!!!  RV engine 'Features':  -bad collision detection (the most essential part of a shooter) walking on rocks = falling through them and die. walking on stairs = get stuck and die. walking towards a wall = glitch through and die  -switch weapon while walking = standing still to switch weapon (finally solved in arma3)  -no free movement i.e. jumping, climbing, etc.  -massive desync between server and clients  -extremely slow server browser that you cant stop from refreshing  -extremeley clunky vehicle physiks  -undynamic sound engine (sounds cant move with their source)  -massive FPS problems on multiplayer and large scale ai missions  -non dynamic lightning (flashlights throw light through walls, etc.)  -several crashes  -non effective memory allocator  -no multi cpu/gpu support  -no 64bit support  -poor ingame voice chat quality   +realistic ballistic  +good sound effects  +nice graphics with huge viewdistance  +extremely huge maps  +nice 'stances' feature  +huge possible amount of players on 1 server    This list would be endless.   they should REALLY outsource the engine development, due NO PROGRAMMING SKILLS.  DayZ SA is the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but even crappier (10-15 FPS in Towns while arma 3 gets around 20-30 FPS on a 50 Player Server).  They should have learned form ofp and arma1&amp;2 that they are unable to programm a stable and performant game engine. So why dont spend some of the earned money to the development process  (as promised in the EA phase) and buy a decent engine from someone, who is able to programm such an engine (UE4, Cryengine 3, Unity)????????????  they set the wrong priorities and ignore the simplest rule of programming: ______________________________ *****KEEP YOUR CODE CLEAN AND FAST***** -----------------------------------------------  they earned at least 200million$ with dayz(&gt;10mil. copies sold)  and about 30million$ with arma 3(&gt;1mil. copie sold)  what are they doing with the money?  the development team is &lt;100 persons  its not personal costs. its not sound recording. its not the mocap sessions. its not engine optimization. its not even design or modelling. its their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING OWN POCKET, where the money goes.  They are taking our money with hands WIDE OPEN (spend about 50â‚¬ for arma 3 and about 23â‚¬ for DayZ), promise to use it for the game and dont spend it in the development process as promised.  Bohemia Interactive has great artists and designers + a good know of realistic weapon behaviour, but the dev-team leaders, and programmers are even stupid as hell or only want your money for no effort....  i really hope, that they are opening their eyes and start optimizing their company, or no one will ever buy another arma or dayz. i wouldnt. i made my experiences with Early Access and Bohemia Interactive, and must tell: THEY ARE LAZY AND MERCENARY. Update Cycles from DayZ are a bad joke. take a look at H1Z1. It was released over a year later, with a MUCH smaller budget, and has updates AT LEAST EVERY 2 Weeks...
6241	1	a	As a former soldier, with two tours of duty under the belt I can certainly say from personal experience, this is incredibly realistic. The ballistics, the sounds, the atmosphere. Took me a while to get into, as I didn't have the best setup. Still gives me sweaty palms, and makes my heart race in places. Has certainly helped reduced effects of combat stress on my mind. Unwinding, playing a few hours really helps. Highly recommended. Seriously, give up on COD/BF series if realism is your goal. Arma all the way!  Hoping that VR compatibility is the developers' list of things to do....   DT
6243	1	a	Without mods pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  With mods best game ever 9/11
6245	1	a	Awesome game having a lot of potential definitley worth playing despite poor campaign which never been though strenght of bohemia interactive games
6247	1	a	in 2 hours we bougth a car a boat managed to die 50 times drive my car into the sea then turn into a knagroo (somehow i managed to fly away with my char jumping like a kangoroo!   That's what my friend told me after we played this game (altis mode)
6249	1	a	Completely realistic and fun. Needs more weapons but the realism is unbelievable. Worth the money, really laggy (if you have a bad computer) but once you 'tweak' the game, it will make the game less laggy. Another thing is that the buildings are so high quality that when you go near them, you lag. Even when you are near hangars!
6251	1	a	:)
6253	1	a	This is a good game but if you do not have a trusty computer it might crash alot or lag so look at some reveiws to see what GC is good for it 
6255	1	a	i dont even have this game lol
6257	1	a	3 little words . best game ever 
6259	1	a	its a good game :)
6261	1	a	Possibly best game ever played, very immersive. 11/10 'it was okay' -IGN
6263	1	a	11/10. One of the best military sims out there (In my opinion.) Plus the controls are better compared to ArmA 2. :P
6265	1	a	If you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!
6267	1	a	This is war and it is amazing. Arma 3 improves on every past Arma game has done and puts it to the max. Aside from the price and sometimes awkward controls Arma 3 is truly astonishing. The campaign is ok but makes up for it with great gameplay and graphical beauty. The multiplayer is great and after you've gotten bored of the base game there's masses of workshop content to entertain you! Overall I'll give Arma 3 a 8.5/10. See you on the frontline!
6269	1	a	This is, hands down, the best military simulator available. There is a steep learning curve and it's not very 'plug and play,' but A3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley.   The Arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.
6271	1	a	This Game... OMG Altis life is one of the best parts of the game. You and your friends doing jobs such as: Cocaine, Heroin, Weed, Diamond, Oil and Iron jobs and much more. Then going out to be a Rebel or be a Cop or just a normal Civilian.   Me and my 3 friends are enjoying this game ALOT. And you will aswell. And if you dont want to play Altis, then you can also play the Campaign and that is really fun aswell, im not a big fan of it but you might be. This game is for every guy who likes the realistic military gameplay and realistic gameplay like the real world.   You can also get the DayZ mod and the Battle Royale mod. I havent tried the DayZ Yet but the Battle Royale is REALLY good. Its a great mod and it should get into the game itself instead of being a mod that you can download.   But this game is really all the money worth.
202	0	a	this game is glitch
6273	1	a	Want a game you can play for years and have no limits to what can be done with this game? 275 hrs and counting and I still find new stuff to do all the time. Only cons are as always with arma, optimization blows. But quite honestly, I probably would've paid $200 if that's what they charged, it's that good.
6275	1	a	Not anyting like the FPS your use to. Its much better! If you are looking for a fast paste fps this is not for you! Requires a bit of your pc, but some commands can help run it a bit better!
6277	1	a	As long as you like heavy team oriented play (no battlefield doesn't count), then you'll love Arma 3. And if you're the kind of person who likes to sit back from the action and just provide some fire support, maybe artillery, or just bringing soldiers to the front line and going back to base, then there is a role in Arma 3 for you.
6279	1	a	If u want a game where bullets actually have a penetration rate, they ricochet depeding on the surface and the type of bullet, an online experience that simulate real life battles, that's the game for you! Probably you'll need a coolio computer for it, but I think it's really worth it, there are a lot of mods and game modes that keep it fresh and cool! Also, you can be whatever u want, a taxi driver, a kamikaze, an eli pilot or just a civilian who doesn't want that people get on his lawn. ALSO! LOOK AT THE GRAPH1C5!!!11! :3
6281	1	a	Epic Game:  -Pick heroin in heroin fields  -Get gear  -Blow up someone with a rocket launcher  -Get murdered by an attack chopper  10/10 would play again 
6283	1	a	Great MilSim, love it.
6285	1	a	Amazing Game, Jaw Dropping Graphics, Tons of Fun, but not worth $60. Perfect Game to buy when on sale!
6287	1	a	This Game is Nothing But Amazing.... I Don't Have A Bad Word To Say About This Game... This Game is Even Better When Being Used To Play DayZ.... A Must Have For Any ArmA Fan
6289	1	a	This game is amazing i cant believe i havent heard of it untill recently! multiplayer is where its at because on the majority of servers i play, nothing is handed to you except a pistol. you have to fight and scavange for weapons and supplies. everything(especially helicopters) is extremely realistic. 9/10
6291	1	a	  Arma III; great game, but...  Arma III checks all the boxes for a simulation. Incredible graphics, massive scope, high level of detail, everything a person would want for a simulation. The short time I played it, I was blown away by its realism. Therein, lies the problem.  Arma III continues a trend I noticed first with the Gran Turismo series of games. GT2 was an fun game to play. A little cartoonish with the graphics and not entirely accurate to real life, but it was real enough to enjoyable. Since then, the Gran Turismo games have become more realistic and I'm in awe everytime a trailer comes out. I haven't bought a game since GT3. GT3 wasn't fun to play, it was too real. The cars required a level of control that I couldn't provide using a controller and TV screen. This is the same issue I have with Arma.  The first time my character died, I think I was receiving fire from in front of me. Each time after that, I couldn't tell you where I was being shot from. After the 10th or 15th time, enough was enough. It was very realistic, and very frustrating. No feedback from my speakers, or anything on screen to indicate where the enemy was. Effectively, I was being punished for playng a computer game on a computer. WASD and a mouse werenot enough for me to play this game.  To sum up:  If you enjoy shooters like Halo or Doom, this might not be for you.  If you were frustrated by the unforgiving nature of MS Flight Simulator, this game is definitely NOT for you.  If you have a thing for playing the most realistic games available, this is the game for you!
6293	1	a	Great game so far! Loving all of the customization and community add ins. Check forums they help a ton
6295	1	a	A fantastic military sandbox with many addons &amp; mods to experiment with. It has its fair share of cons and pros, the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer portion of the game and the decency of your PC.  If you intend to buy this game, I recommend upgrading the specs on your PC to something of above average. I'm not saying that if you have a PC with not as up-to-date specs that you won't have the same ArmA3 experience, I'm just saying that in order to get more out of this game you may want to consider doing so.  Singleplayer is fantastic. With the steamworks support and modding support this game has, singleplayer is a blast aside from the campaign. Definitely a game aimed at more hardcore players, singleplayer dishes out an amazing campaign as well as scenario missions. You'll notice that in singleplayer the game is easier to run and achieve higher fps.  Multiplayer is a piece of work, it really depends whos hosting, what gamemode you are playing, and if your PC specs are able to handle the stress. Playing gamemodes like Altis Life and King of The Hill you'll notice that you are able to play on nicer graphics settings and achieve higher fps than playing modes like Capture the Island or Cooperative (Invade &amp; Annex). Playing the latter 2 you might find yourself having to run at lower settings and/or have lower fps. This doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy these gamemodes for yourself, it just means all those snazzy, jazzy looks and feels won't be high end.  Away from the cons and on to the pros, this game is one of the best military sims/sandboxes out there. With ArmA3's many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of soldiers into battle, relaxing on an tropical island, or even building your own mission. Whether you are a hardcore or casual gamer, this game has got you covered.  All in all, I'd give this game a 9/10
6297	1	a	It's good
6299	1	a	Ill write a review later I'm busy playing Arma 3!
6301	1	a	Very Recommended game by youtubers and gamers
6303	1	a	Buy this game! Download sandbox map! Play with friends! Accidentally kill everyone!
6305	1	a	If you're looking for a tactical and realistic approach to a shooter this is the only way to go. If you don't have the pacience to play a slower paced shooter, then you should look the other way. The community keeps the game alive and fresh, either with mods, missions, or even game types. The size of the maps is so big, you'll hardly ever repeat anything in the same place. This is a game you won't get tired of, the platform just allows for new stuff getting created everyday...  ArmA is a unique experience, nothing even compares with it. It's not perfetct, it does have its bugs and glitches, but in the end  it is worth every penny .
6307	1	a	Arma 3 is a great improvement over Arma 2 and OA this doesnt have M4A1's or M16's but does have the FNX45, Masada, and others the vehicles are more futuristic so no ABRAMS or Blackhawks but all of this is fine because you can download mods or get All in Arma to get ported content from the previous Arma games. Over all I think you should get this game and as it says it brings you to WAR!
6309	1	a	Despite many of its early faults, Bohemia Interactive - as well as the always extremely-active ArmA community of modders et al - really pulled the ArmA universe to a whole new level. The graphics are only the beginning of the immersive environment: realistic projectile ballistics (as well as surprisingly detailed terminal ballistic effects), well-done animations (especially of essential combat tasks, like reloading), and the variable stance/lean system. Unfortunately, there are a few problems that have plagued ArmA since the beginning of time, namely the AI. I say this because even after becoming intimately familiar with the game and the teammate command system, detailed commands are bulky at best. AI as a whole tends to be relatively oblivious when it comes to medium- and 'crew-served' weapons; the suppressive fire command does absolutely nothing with your machinegunners and autoriflemen, and anti-tank gunners apparently forget they have 15 pound rocket launchers strapped to their backs and decide their small arms are the most effective weapons against MBTs. The aerial platforms' damage models could be improved as well (i.e.: losing parts of the aircraft when you clip a tree or wires rather than just exploding), however, this would require a lot more work than may be worth it at this point - perhaps later in A3's lifetime. Fortunately to me, despite these (at times) fatally annoying flaws (*cough* AI *cough*) nothing in the virtual world comes close to the level of accuracy (both from the vanilla BI platform and the ArmA communities' multiple mods) that ArmA 3 delivers.
6311	1	a	This game took my virginity! i rate this 9 out of 11 because yolo.
6313	1	a	This Game is SO realistic it took me 54 hours to get my first sniper kill
6315	1	a	Great game, Very Good War Simulator also very fun to play with friends. 5/5
6317	1	a	Hopped onto a role playing server and died by flying 30 ft into the air while getting out of a truck. 10/10
6319	1	a	This game...  It can be seen as a good game. Or one that is terrible.   Most likely what will happen though is that some guy with 7 hours comes along and says it is garbage.  Then there will be that one guy with some 300 hours logged claiming that new players will have trouble adpating to Arma 3's engine and game mechanics.  In these reviews there are no middleground, so it could make someone feel like they need to log 300 hours to feel like the guy who wrote the review.   My review is written with 60-70 hrs of gametime. Here is My review:   The game has no real competitors, and the only things similar to it is Arma 2 and the original Arma. This is what causes that beginning time gap to learn how to play the game. If I were to go and play COD, then switch to BF4(I know that they have a good amount of differences in them) I know I can, in 2 hours, play BF4 as well as I played COD, If I had logged the same amount of hours in both of them. Here, it's different. Since Arma has huge changes between the modern FPS games like COD and BF, then those who are new to the Arma Franchise will have to adapt. For me, I didn't adapt as soon as I got the game since I had gotten the game for Altis life(Something I will go into later). It took me around 6 hrs of missions to be effective in combat. By adapting from the Fps games I had usually played, I developed better habits in Arma. These habits include slowing myself down, going prone to stabalize my gun, and to stay with my sqaud. This is what makes Arma so unique. It is a simulator, and everything you do actually matters. So heres a breakdown of teh good and the bad:  Good  2 Large maps with great terrain and underwater features  a good selection of weapons and vehicles  Great graphcs  Great Workshop ability  Great Multiplayer Servers(Makes up the other 40% of Arma Users. Stuff like Altis life, takistan life, adn etc, are something other than war)    THE BAD  The graphics could kill your computer  First person mode can get people sick due to the preset settings  First person mode presets can also lower framerate  Cars have bad controls(again can be fixed in the settings)  The 6 hr beginner time gap  The impressions the game gives to people  Overall  8.5/10  Oh.. Did I talk about mods,   9/10 :D
6321	1	a	Great game! if you can afford it, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!
6323	1	a	This game for real man, not for kid
6325	1	a	Even though I could only play for a couple days it was a really good game.  9.5/10
6327	1	a	 http://www.twitch.tv/actabunnifoofoo 
6329	1	a	Better than Arma 2.
6331	1	a	Probably the world's most realistic Military FPS. So many tactics can be used at any given moment, along with an endless arsenal of weapons and vehicles. Create your own story with the scenario editor, play with friends in Online, retake Stratis in the Campaign, or play a custom scenario game. If you like realistic modern shooters that have a squad/platoon system and would rather take orders from players instead of a pushy AI. Then this masterpiece is for you!
6333	1	a	pretty sick m8
6335	1	a	Hmm.. What can i say about ArmA 3? I mean.. i can't describe it because of its awesome epicnessÂ³. Just buy it and u will never play another game ;)
6337	1	a	Amazingly beautiful graphics, and Breaking Point is one of the best game mods I've played. I really enjoy the King Of The Hill game-play, in Arma 3, too.  The only downside is you need a very rad computer, mainly CPU, to play this without horrible lag.  I recently upgraded to a 4th gen i5 and a GTX 750ti which has greatly improved the playability of this game.
6339	1	a	its a good game the only problem is arma 3 life dosent work unless you have tons of mods 
6341	1	a	Currently my favourite game. Anyone looking for a realistic shooter needs to play this game. Also the modability makes it a game with unlimited options! Definitely check out all the mods that are out there. Worthy successor to the original Operation Flashpoint.
6343	1	a	Gameplay if fantastic, maps are fantastic, missions are fantastic, wasteland is fantastic, mods are fantastic, rp life sucks.    8.5/10
6345	1	a	10/10
6347	1	a	This game is unvelievebly fun! I have spent nearly 1,500 hours playing ArmA 3, thousands of servers are available for a range of user-made game modes.  BI has done a great job with the development tools available for ArmA 3 as well as the fully-accessable wiki which provides all of the commands for scripters and developers, they've given the user thousands of ways of developing their own gamemodes, mods, maps, anything.  I would highly reccomend this game to anyone into FPS and 3rd Person Shooters, the userability in this game is outstanding.  (p.s - if you join a server and its laggy, its not ArmA 3, its most commonly your graphics settings (this game is CPU heavy) or its caused by bad optimization of the mission which has most probably been user-made)  
6349	1	a	10/10
6351	1	a	10/10 would get blown up a good few times again. But in all seriousness, this game has a couple of flaws (the performance in online servers is a tad weird at times) this game is one of the best things I've played in a LONG time. You see, this game has so much depth it's unbelievable. There are so many weapons and realistic vehicles that are so realistic you feel like you're really on the frontlines of a battlefield. To be honest, it's more of a simulator than anything else. It's worth the Â£20 just for the entertainment value and the laughs you get on some of the online modes. That's not mentioning this is probably the best map in video game history. Don't expect this game to be easy either - elements of tactfullness and patience are very much needed much like a real world frontline scenario! Hands down the best FPS on the market right now; hands down beats any C.O.D. or Battlefield game! PLEASE buy it if you don't have it!
6353	1	a	AwSome!!!
6355	1	a	Do you find yourself angry at the COD or Battlefield for being horrible unrealistic? If you this is the game for you, guns, tanks, planes, boats. What more is there to say?
6357	1	a	This is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. You might not want to buy this as your first FPS game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another FPS. It has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. I think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. I have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10
6359	1	a	Just buy it! No further information needed
6361	1	a	I got the game while it was free for two days and it was awsome, I loved everything about the game, but it was a little to graphic for my windows 7. But trust me this is worth 59.99. But make sure your PC can take the graphics.
6363	1	a	A virtual battlefield and simulation experience like no other since 2001 (Op. Flashpoint). And series, as Arma, continues to evolve with this great, yet not perfect, title. Enough said.
6365	1	a	Singleplayer: The campaign is dull but at the same time, barely cool. (you probably wont touch it)  Multiplayer: Although this game takes quite a tuffy 'pooter to run well on most multiplayer servers than most people have available to them, and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ processor usage due to the gaming engine it runs on, I've never found a better game than ArmA 3. I've looked into this game for about a year or two before I even got into PC gaming and it became one of my first footsteps into the PC gaming world (aside from WoW when I was like 13, but lets be serious here.) The replayability you'll find in this game holds no bounds. You have a vibrant cultural community and more content then you'll know what to do with...DID I MENTION CONTENT? You've got gamemodes upon gamemodes upon workshop toys to play on and with, from Wasteland, Altis Life, King of the Hill, Exile, and so so much more. Although the controls WILL take a bit to get used to, you wont ever forget. Think this is a military combat simulator? Well it is, but it's also practically a flying simulator, a helicoptor simulator, a life simulator, a zombie survival simulator, and even a verbal harassment simulator. But let's get down to it kiddos.  ----Pros -This game can be about 40+ other games that you've always wanted and be better. -Precise movements to benefit you in combat (Micro-Stances) -Ballistic physics that work -Beautiful large game -Tons of gamemodes that aren't always 'military' -Hilarious physics that break in the best of ways (there are two terms, 'ArmA Logic' and 'ArmA Physics') -The most replayability you'll ever have out of any game TO DATE.  ----Cons -DLC bundle(25USD) is annoying if you don't have it, as many servers use the DLC content and you'll be bothered with a popup quite a bit. -Medium to High Performance computer to run it -Physics in the game engine aren't always the greatest of things and WILL screw you over at times (but almost rarely) -MASSSIIIIIVEEEEEE LEARNNNINGGGG CURRRRVVVEEEEEE -Did I mention the learning curve for the controls? -Learning curve -Although the game can be used as a simulator for many things, it's FAR from a driving simulator. -Rocks and branchy bushes (You'll know) -The game engine is quite â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but no where near unplayable  VERDICT------- ArmA 3 in my opinion is the best game on the market to date with the experience you'll get out of it. Proof? I have 1600+ hours on it, and my 2nd place game in my library only has about 400. Some of my best gaming moments in my life came from this game 10/10 would buy again     ..but seriously did I mention the learning curve?
6367	1	a	Arma 3 is an amazing game! This game is great for anyone who likes shooters or RP games. This game is one of the best first person/3rd person games I have ever played. I have played Arma 2 and I have to say Arma 3 is so much better than Arma 2. The only problems about this games that really game to my attention is... First off glitches, they're not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then. Also servers is a big problem, there aren't many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes, the ones that I commonly see is Deathmatch or Battle Royale, Breakingpoint, King Of The Hill, and some others, but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st/3rd person shooter genre. I really recommend you get this game, especially if you're coming from Arma 2 or even Battlefield. Thanks! I hope I helped you out!
6369	1	a	The WorldÂ´s one and only Military Simulation Game ! If you want an awesome Team-based and realistic Military Simulation this is the only right choice for you !  Nothing for Solo-Player like COD or Battlefield !!! THIS IS NOT KILL ON SIGHT AND ITS NOT AN EGO-SHOOTER OR ARCADE-SHOOTER,ITS A MILITARY SIMULATION...THERE IS NO SPACE FOR RAMBOÂ´S !!! If you are a lone wolf and think you could kill an enemy squad alone or something...They will show you are wrong. You cant survive more than MAX 3-5 bullets based on your hitzones !  ARMA 3 : THIS IS WAR
6371	1	a	Great military simulator. Even better with mods that improve immersion.
6373	1	a	Great Game.So realistic!
6375	1	a	If you have a Pc that can run this game at atleast medium settings 30fps. Best 60$ you have ever spent.
6377	1	a	The latest in the ArmA series, this is the best military simulator out there, and it sure does live up to the hype, with a fantastic graphic upgrade.  Apart from just upgrading the graphics, it has created 2 new maps for you to go crazy on in this sandbox military simulator where quite literally, the sky is the limit.   Engaging Close Quarters Combat, entertaining infantry combat with a load of other people and AI with vehicles to back you up, the amount of scenarios you and your friends can experience is endless, due to the thriving community that has come from ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead, to make these games even better.   Whilst even without any mods, this game still lives up to the standard that is expected from Bohemia Interactive in this long running series of military simulator/sandboxes. They added new movement, new weapons, new vehicles. Whilst no classic weapons like the M4/M16/AR15 series don't make a return, along with the AK47/74/74su, they are replaced with new weapons that are more towards the future.  The game itself is set in 2035, when the Republic of Altis and Stratis is facing a civil war, NATO comes in and attempts to help the AAF in the war against CSAT, they are turned on and the AAF teams up with CSAT to destroy NATO forces in this gripping fight between yourself and loads of tough AI.  In this futuristic settings, along with new weapons, new toys have been added to your arsenal to mess about with. New vehicles include submarine type transport vehicles, amphibious armoured personnel carriers, and scuba-diving equipment. It all totals up to a crazy sandbox experience with a load of missions and scenarios from the community, from Altis Life to Wasteland.
6379	1	a	This is a good game
6381	1	a	9.5/10  A brilliant game for anyone who wants a realistic* and immersive warfare game. I've been with this game since the alpha and enjoyed every moment.  pros -Long and detailed campaign with a good story -varying multiplayer for all players -large mod base for improving or extending the game -large amount of customization for the player loadout and weapons -immersive and realistic* gameplay -stunning graphics (see cons for exceptions) -extremely large terrains for gameplay  cons -some of the audio is slightly unrealistic such as explosions (can be fixed with mods such as speed of sound pure) -particle effects are a let down for the graphics -there is not a massive amount of weapons available in the vanilla game* (there are many mods which add more weapons to the game)  *personal opinions (some people may disagree with these)
6383	1	a	See youtube videos. Buy game. Join server. Shot from 3000m 10/10
6385	1	a	Desync is real, get swallowed by metal fence's and brick walls and rocks resulting in death .......
6387	1	a	Best shooter I have ever played, all you need is a descent pc.
6389	1	a	Awesome cooperative game!
6391	1	a	THE SOUND IS COMPLETLY BROCKEN AND I CANT HEAR ANY THING
6393	1	a	this game is worth buying. it has good graphics... i dont even have to mention anything everythings awesome with it
6395	1	a	Would recommend if you have a strong computer. Sounds are vastly improved over Arma II and combat is very great.
6397	1	a	Amazing Game Love It, Can Be Rage Inducing at times, but in the end its all for good times, and good memories. 10/10
6399	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ and call me samantha, this is a good game.
6401	1	a	One of the best games (if the the best) I've ever played. Was expecting the singleplayer campaign to be a bit longer with a few more missions but it still took me about a 100h to complete! I definitely recommend this game to any fps lover that can put in the time and effort to master the shooting mechanics.
6403	1	a	 &gt;Joins wasteland server &gt;Loots heaps of really good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ &gt;Falls less than a centimeter &gt;Dies  10/10 would fall to my doom again   Disregard my last review of this game. Arma has been shrivled down to a framework for making roleplay gamemodes.  Never have I seen a server that has decent PvP or combat gameplay. The only thing you'll find on the server browser is Tanoa/Altis life or heavily modded DayZ clones that make you download 10gb worth of mods for each server.  This game has too much potential. Are we going to waste it on making RP servers that don't even allow for usage of the great gameplay Arma provides?  I'm still giving this a thumbs up because the game itself is great, but the server owner's don't know an existance that isn't roleplay.
6405	1	a	So I have played many hours and 'I like it a lot': So have you: Ever wanted to run around while looking at your feet making it look like your sucking your own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? Brake dance? Shoot a guy in the knee and laugh at him because he can't run anymore? Run in to battle in your undies? (Note: thereâ€™s a bug that doesn't allow you to go naked) Do a back flip in a chopper? Get into a tank LAV and go down the highway at 100km/h then hit a rock and go flying. And a lot more! Who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet? Remember Men Play ARMA! BTW: Lots of people won't like this game because they don't know what to play on it. find what modes you like or make your own!
6407	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played. 10/10 Love it. Will play it for years to come.
6409	1	a	And outstanding multiplayer sandbox game that is so addictive !!! got me playing nothing else :D.... Amazing game &lt;3
6411	1	a	You know a game is good when you spend more than 50 hours on it, on Christmas week, totally ignoring friends and family. Opening presents? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that! I'm playing ARMA.
6413	1	a	You want endless fun?  GET THIS GAME
6415	1	a	This game is by far the best game I ever bought if you like realistic shooter games this is for you.
6417	1	a	Very glad they had a free to play weekend, as well as an awesome weekend sale. Got into boot camp and being a hardcore battlefield player i was hooked immediately. wow, i'm looking forward to some really good tacatical game play with my friends.
6419	1	a	I really love this game. There is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. There are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. You need to find your stuff and survive, I really like this game and I could play it for days striaght without stopping because it's just so fun. Add me as a friend and we could play Arma 3 sometime , I am always on :)
6421	1	a	Arma 3 aims to be a realistic military/combat simulator, a goal that is well achieved, with very few drawbacks. I would definitely reccommend this game to anyone looking for a truly realistic First/Third Person Shooter or Military Simulation. If you're expecting this to be like Battlefield, you're wrong. If you expect this to be like Rainbow Six: Siege, you're wrong. If you ecpect this to be like CoD, why are you even here? I'd probably most closely compare this game to Squad, but with 2 maps that are much larger than any of those in Squad, and it's more complicated. There are several interesting game types in Arma 3, however most are simply overshadowed by the sheer mass of servers running Invade and Annex and Arma Life. Some things I would reccommend to newcomers are that you have a mic, and when joining a server online, you find out their Teamspeak or other 3rd party chat program server, because people will yell at (or kick) you for using global voice chat on most servers. I would also reccommend checking out some guides on youtube, as there is a very minimal tutorial system that could really use some work.  I would definitely give this game an 8/10  It successfully achieves its goals of an accurate military simulation, however the lack of a good tutorial and the fact that many excellent gamemodes are overshadowed by larger servers that only focus on 2 or 3 game types definitely takes away from the score.
6423	1	a	ARMA 3 is my go to game... always new mod coming out and this make for free amazing content
6425	1	a	Super sereal kill bots simulator.
6427	1	a	An amazing FPS, Action, Multiplayer game. With Sick Graphics!  ArmA 3, a game like no other, buy the game and experience Ground Combat, Air Combat, Artillery, and so much more! It also comes in with a group of Gamemodes, like Wasteland, Epoch Mod, Overpoch Mod, Altis Life, ArmA 3 Life, etc.  Buy this game! You won't regret it.  
6429	1	a	Good game, really funny if u can figure out how to play it. Worthwell to try it !
6431	1	a	Arma 3 is a very realistic game, It has many different posabilities.  The pros are the graphics and style of gameplay. However the downfall is the dlcs which must be purchased to unlock all the game content. I would have preferredfor it to be in 2 different games like arma 2 and arma 2 OA.
6433	1	a	Nice game! King of the Hill &lt;3 If you want to play a game with friends together and you want to play with tactics...this game is awesome for that.
6435	1	a	Awesome Game! Breaking Point is a great MOD for the game as well! Well worth your time and money!
6437	1	a	this game is awesome buy it. you won't regret
6439	1	a	Can your PC handle the awesomeness of arma 3? If so, put this awesome game in your library! (Get a steam key for 30 bucks on green man  gaming.com) 
6441	1	a	If you are into military simulation and have a bunch of friends, you can have some fun for the rest of your life!
6443	1	a	Massive Improvement since the last game which I've been playing for about 4 years.
6445	1	a	Incredible game, love every bit of it, it's worth the money!! The AI are better than what I experienced with Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead for sure, the physics are incredible!!!
6447	1	a	IT'S NOT A ORDINARY SHOOTER. IT'S A REAL WAR IN YOUR COMPUTER!!!
6449	1	a	I don't even own this game. lel
6451	1	a	I have over 500 hours on this game, and I enjoyed every single minute. Even when you finish the campain, the mods the community make are even better. So much to do in this game
6453	1	a	great game with excellent potential to keep adding worlds
6455	1	a	Love The Game It's The Ultimate Tactical Shooter.I Reccomend to buy deluxe
6457	1	a	Reccomended for: people who like tactical realism  not recomended for: peopole who like fps games that dont simulate the army, like COD
6459	1	a	This game is really good.
6461	1	a	Wonderful game. heavily moddable by the community. Would reccomend this for the simluator aspect. its full on immersive gameplay and fire fights.
6463	1	a	Wow... So much fun. So tacky So buggy, So laggy :3
6465	1	a	Such an amazing game, especially for serious gamers!
6467	1	a	yersh das is gud
6469	1	a	THIS GAME IS GOOD I PLAY IT ALL DAY 
6471	1	a	It reminds me of games with guns. It is a good game with guns.
6473	1	a	Great modern warfare simulator that is completely brutal and unforgiving, make sure your PC can run the game before you buy, as it does have reasonably high requirements
6475	1	a	Outrageous war simulator !  10/10 
6477	1	a	kinda boring but ya know whatever  5/10 wouldnt play again l0l ecks dee
6479	1	a	I don't even have the game but it's allowing me to write this.   I win.
6481	1	a	Is very good game. Lot of ruski. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6483	1	a	Great game in graphics and gameplay aspects. Mods are awesome too. It's a shame that the optimization drives so many players away
6485	1	a	Amazing game! Have so much fun playing!!
6487	1	a	Mod's. Mod's. The things that make the game good. Oh and did I bring up the part where there selling us DLC Just to add some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ go-karts and some half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ helis? Well yeah. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off with DLC and just leave us alone. 'You MUST buy the DLC to use this go-kart' Are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding me?
6489	1	a	Almost 2 years later, still 60 dollars.   0/60 dollars left in my wallet 
6491	1	a	I really recommend this game because of its nice graphics, great Singleplayer/Multiplayer. I got the Arma 3 Limited Deluxe Edition for $55,47. It contains Arma 3, a map of Altis and Stratis, an awesome keycard, ARMA: Cold War Assault, a keyboard layout, a digital soundtrack, a digital tactical guide, digital maps and all DLCs. For its price it is just a bargain. Buy it and you won't regret! :)
6493	1	a	its a lot of fun especialy if you love military tactical and realistic games its FPS and TPS it contains divers paratroopers airforse infantry sniper aormourd vehicals I RECOMEND THIS GAME
6495	1	a	this game is great for those players who wants more than just running around shooting people in cod of battlefield. arma 3 is an extremely well made militairy simulator which gives you multiple choises of gamemodes and hours of intense firefights. you can go on multiplayer with you and your crew or go in a free for all deathmatch in Battle Royale.   personally arma 3 is my favorite game and definetly recommend people to try this out. the campaign has a really good story, solid multiplayer servers, a well made Editor to make your own missions.   it could use a few fixes on terrain(if you are far away from someone the map tends to glitch and show flying objects) and maybe a little improvement on animations but this game truly is one for the books.   Bohemia Interactive, Well Done :D
6497	1	a	So I got Global Banned for no reason... K
6499	1	a	Yes in very good fun
6501	1	a	most bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ game ive ever played
6503	1	a	Arma 3 is a ridiculously complicated military simulator which includes 7 buttons just to look around (that is if you're too special to use the mouse like everyone else). You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy, while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same, move on to the next town, take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles, then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine, a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license, set off to a life of adventure, get robbed, stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money, right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening, but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy, run him over, then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident, that is to say, you pull a guy over for speeding, he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body.  Honestly, do I need to say anymore?
6505	1	a	best Military simulation game ever!!  10/10!   
6507	1	a	My team died. I was all alone. I had managed to kill many of the enemy. When the path to the objective seemed safe and clear, I made a run for it.  *BOOM* A grenade launcher shot blew up right next to me.  I fell out of my chair in fear and had to take off my headset to make sure I was still alive.  10/10 would cry again 
6509	1	a	Remember folks, suppressing fire does not suppress.  10/10 would suppress again.
6511	1	a	I will quote a good friend of mine;  'Steam winter sale FTW. ARMA is 50% off again - which makes it priced about right given the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ery required to make it work all snazzy.'  Best Arma review ever. If you can run the gauntlet, this game is brilliant. If you expect to download something, and have it work, best wait awhile. 
6513	1	a	4 reasons to buy ArmA III.  1. I looked at the horizon and saw a Hemmt going to space, I had to double-check if I wasn't playing any space related games.  2. A guy hitted the brakes and got thrown out of his car.  3. A medic was driving on the mainroad, I heard his sirenes when suddenly BOOM, an offroad flew through the sky a moment later.  4. Freaking people using Go-Karts as rocket proppelant.  100/10 Altis Space Program
6515	1	a	Love it, Altis life rolling around with the clans always a good time when coppas stop a car filled to the top full of heroin XD
6517	1	a	This review is for a badge but this is still a GREAT GAME!
6519	1	a	Altis life in a nutshell:  -Takes 150,000$ out of his atm to go buy a helicopter -Gets stopped and robbed all my money on the road to the airport -Goes back to the copper mine to earn money -Gets stopped and robbed by a kid admin, except i already got robbed before so i had 0$ -Asks me if i could drive him somewhere -i insult him and i drive off  -'Kicked by admin, reason: being rude'  10/10 would get robbed again
6521	1	a	Great game but the people are very hostile, watch a few gameplays before playing you will more than likely get rekt otherwise
6523	1	a	Hello Community,  Arma 3 is in my opinion one of the best games I ever played. You have so many options how you can play this game. You want.. Survival.. RP.. PvP.. PvE.. Arma 3 give it all to you. So if you ask me you should buy this f*cking game and play the shiit out of it.   Greetings Zadary!
6525	1	a	Really Like this Game its Really like a Sandbox Simulation and you can mod it how you want. I still play it after 400h and I'm still motivated. Really good game.
6527	1	a	You think you gonna shoot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game? You dont. You walk, you run. This is running simulator.
6529	1	a	well.... if you like being shot on a server my your own team for getting into the the wrong heli then this game is for you but it is very good to play with friends
6531	1	a	If it fits, I sit
6533	1	a	Best game ever. My fav part is altis life &lt;3
6535	1	a	From the perspective of a player that hasn't experienced the previous 2 ArmA's, this game is great! It's provided something that I've wanted for a long time; a sandbox, army based, mod-able, campaign! The graphics are lovely and customization is very vast. The DLC is actually worth it for once, and I cannot wait for more to come out!  Very Good game, Get it if you like combat!  - 10/10
6537	1	a	Great gameplay. Shitiest UI out of any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game!
6539	1	a	The hot-doggiest game your butt will evr experience in its whole lifetime! Gun play is great and if something ain't for you, then visit the workshop!
6541	1	a	Arma 3 is an awesome, intense and realistic shooter ( besides the fact that you run for 10 seconds and then your character starts to waddle around)  8/10
6543	1	a	Ruined my life.  10/10
6545	1	a	YOU THINK THIS IS A FUTURE ENDEAVOR? ITS NOT ITS JUST NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU IT ISN'T
6547	1	a	its a game on steam 11/4
6549	1	a	Possibly the most realistic military game with extreme replayablility. I don't regret a single cent I spent on this game, worth everything I Yianni is a F_A_G for it and more!
6551	1	a	Skip to the bottom for a quick overview of this review.  Gameplay: When this game works it truly shines. Overall the game feels just a lot more tight than the previous ArmA games. The camera does not have that weird movement feeling anymore and is replaced by a normal first person camera. The gunplay feels pretty similar, though sometimes the hitboxes of enemies feels way off. It is a little more user friendly and less clunky than the other games. Scuba diving looks gorgeous and is a welcome addition. This is still a really complicated game and will take many hours to master. All the customization options are still here, and the raw number of weapons, vehicles, and attachments is stunning. The inventory is ever so slightly streamlined which makes it a lot easier to navigate it without losing any functionality. Beware though, the â€œGâ€ key is now grenade not gear! The modding community is very active and tons of content is being produced all the time. The base campaign is semi nonlinear and is so far tons of fun, and a hell of a lot less buggy than ArmA 2â€™s. This game as an absolutely mind boggling amount of content. 8/10  Sound: Much better than ArmA 2â€™s. The radio chatter almost sounds normal finally. The gunfire sounds pretty average, actually most of the sound effects are pretty average. However sound effects in the distance sound neat. Hearing the gunfire from a battle far away is always cool, as well as far away explosions. 6/10   Graphics: This is a beautiful game. As always the draw distances are jawdropping. The characters look a lot better, and most of the objects look equally good. Trees and other vegetation look freaking awesome. For me though, the lighting has been the biggest improvement. Seeing the sun poke through branches in trees has never looked so good. I wish this game ran just a little faster, and that it utilized a little more of my system resources. I am above the recommended specs for this game and still only get about 40 FPS with most settings turned to high. (Not ultra) 9/10  Story: For this kind of game a story is really not necessary, and yet we are treated to a halfway decent one! It is there and worth playing though, and is much improved over ArmA 2â€™s. The missions are a lot shorter, and thus generally have less scripting errors. 7/10  Editor: From what I can tell not a ton is improved over the previous editors. It is still super powerful and surprising not impossible to learn how to use. Lots of different kinds of missions could be made. Zeus, which is basically a 3D editor, is absolutely amazing except for one big drawback; it doesnâ€™t give you the option to save anything after you used it. I know it was intended for multiplayer but it would have been nice to finally have a 3D editor. 7/10  Multiplayer: I do not generally play the multiplayer aspects of games very much. However most of my experience with it was confusing and chaotic. To truly get the most out of it you would need to join a clan.   Summary: This is a very fun game with a ton of content that will only appeal to a small percentage of people. I personally loved it, and enjoyed the many tweaks it made to how ArmA 2 felt. Although not perfect, almost everything is improved and once again proved that ArmA is the leading military simulator. If you are interested in playing a game like that, this is the best the market has to offer.   Recommended to hardcore fans of FPSâ€™s, people interested in military simulators, and to people who have played ArmA games in the past.  Recommended Purchase Price: 30 bucks if slightly interested  Full Price if you know you like this kind of game   Final Personal Score: 8.5/10
6553	1	a	Be advised:  +Extreme realism +Complex squad play +Awesome engine +Mods (Altis Life, Epoch etc.)  -Extreme realism -AI Squad Leaders are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ -Little content inside. Requires third-party content to remain interesting. -Does anyone actually play the game itself?  you will never get closer to an actual war/10
6555	1	a	Great game, but BI's failure to optimise their Arma engine disappoints the majority of the community. EA was able to run BF4 on a tablet, perhaps they should learn for them.
6557	1	a	TL;DR: Very good game. Get it if its not already in your library. If it is in your library get it for a friend.  This game is a very solid entry in the Arma franchise. It improves upon Arma 2 in every way besides content. But that is even made up for in mods. If youve played Arma 2 and enjoyed it, then youll love this. If you havent played any Army before, youll still love this. It is a must buy. But ill explain why that is my review.  Pros: -This game has very good graphics and well optimised -I would go as far to say this is the most 'realistic' combat game out there -There is loads of content in the Steam Workshop for many hours of fun and tons of mods and game modes -The PvP is simply the best PvP in any game Ive ever played, and Ive played a lot of games -Compared to the last Arma it improves in all areas (besides content- Ill cover that in the Cons) -There is very few squeakers and trollers, and it has a mature player base.  -New inventory system is very well done -The sound in this game is amazing.   Cons: -It will absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your PC. You need a good graphics card to run this game. (It runs like a champ if you have a good card) -Lack of weapons and vehicles. (But it makes up for it by having a great attatchment system) -This is not for impatient people. Nearly every mission will have you walk at least 1km. (I dont find this a Con, but I imagine most FPS players would)  Final rating would be 9/10. Simply because it requires a very good rig to run it well.
6559	1	a	Its a very good milsim and its big jump forwards for ArmA series.
6561	1	a	Straight out awsome game to play with the friends
6563	1	a	ArmA 3 is a really great game if you have the patience for it. There are many game modes and it is a lot of fun with friends. I highly reccomend this game to anyone that hasn't played it yet.
6565	1	a	Played a little, was fun.
6567	1	a	it a cool
6569	1	a	played a little bit and its just, mehh, just ok
6571	1	a	Nothing like running around a 120 player war zone in your whitie-tighties
6573	1	a	This Game is Really Fun! Totally worth 40â‚¬
6575	1	a	The only fps that allows you to run straight and look left and right! Thumbs up!  I downloaded Arma 3 to play the Breaking Point and Epoch mods. Both are great! Highlly Recommend!  
6577	1	a	You enter combat with your team/squad, hop in a chopper, fly to destination, parachute in, forget to pull chord, fall to death. Would jump again 10/10.  In all honesty, I would say get this game. It's hard to learn, but it gets so good once you learn how, and you get into a combat zone, and bullets are wizzing by, jets flying overhead, and then you hear an explosion, and the house on the next block is destroyed.
6579	1	a	The first couple days, can be really painful for most of the people, 'ArmA 3' is kinda hard to understand, it's not for everyone especially not for 'BF/COD lovers', the maps are really great, graphics are awesome same as the audio, this game is made really good, not as ArmA 2. ArmA 2 is lagging a lot, has a lot of fps drops, playing ArmA 2 on 1920x1080 Mid/Low and i have only 30-60 FPS, ArmA 3 on 1920x1080 Ultra High/High 80 FPS +++, half of ArmA 3 players can't kill a standing player, so the combat is pretty easy i'd say, the game is pretty expensive but it's definitely worth the money, 10/10.  
6581	1	a	Stole a police car then drowned in the water while a child cop told me im stupid  12/10 would recommend
6583	1	a	Loving Arma 3. The A.I still... is either mentally challenged or trained by Seal Team 6. But still a great game.
6585	1	a	I would say that the best way to describe ArmA III would be to say that it sends you to war. Be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game, and ejecting just in time to avoid death, then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs, to defend it to your death, or be it in having your Humvee hit by an RPG and having your commanding officer's head shot off by a sniper. The game is what you make it, but I will say this. This is not a casual game by any means. If you are a fan of games like COD or BF you will not be happy with this game. The hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive, but I can say from experience that when you do succeed, you will be as excited as ever. I would reccomend most players to start out playing online, because that is where most of the fun is. The multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. The game's sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends, though it does lose something when playing alone. I would reccomend playing with friends. I give it a 8/10.
6587	1	a	So once you've figured out what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you're doing you'll like this game, if not then go play some Call of Duty.
6589	1	a	Totally worth it both for SP and for MP. Especially for MP.
6591	1	a	Realistic. And sometimes not realistic, but its a simulator so what'd you expect. Go kill a bunch of people and make a ton of money racking up your war crimes only to realize hours later none of it was real. Kinda like playing a game all day huh?
6593	1	a	This game made me an operator,its so tactial 30 minds ride to fire one bullet and die,also made me pop boners on tacticool gear,all in all I give if 9 out of 10 dynamic stories,if only the FPS was operational level i would operate with other operators,
6595	1	a	I stepped through a 8 foot wall and took out the enemy patrol 420/69 would wall magic again
6597	1	a	I've been part of the ARMA franchise since Operation Flashpoint. This is by far the best MilSim to ever be released. If you're into slow, simulated and realistic gameplay... This game is the one for you.
6599	1	a	How many hours have i got ^
6601	1	a	The most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the Go Kart addon.
6603	1	a	Really good game to play with your friends. Although I was playing on a server and it seemed to have max players on it (There was 2 servers) and my browser seemed to stop working after a while.... so i had to restart the whole game then refresh a couple of times then it would stop again. Thats really the only probelem, the co-op is amazing - It almost reminds me of Planetside 2 when you have a squad and there are mortar strikes and everything works out... Anyway, I would recomend this game to alot of my friends :-)
6605	1	a	it should be on mac aswell
6607	1	a	Very fun game with all the mods and fetures avalible; fun with friends or ALONE!  10/10 would buy again
6609	1	a	Hello, Very Good game if into Simulation and also it relates very well to real life, This game Is very mod flexible and there have been alot of mod releases latley e.g. Arma 3life Milsin units and all of that sort of stuff that takes the modding cabablilties very far with this game
6611	1	a	I personally like the Game Modes and the ways you can play greatly Optmized game all you need a beefed up computer and you might be able to play on High or even Ultra Graphics I used to play on a Laptop which i could get over 20+ FPS now I have my New computer which can run at High with 30+ FPS and its still just as good as it was still love the Gamemodes and its even better to play. I really like his game and I hope you do too.
6613	1	a	Singleplayer: 74 fps. Multiplayer: -12312424 fps. bohemia in a nutshell.
6615	1	a	Great game overall, but very CPU intensive...
6617	1	a	i forgot i needed a parachute
6619	1	a	Drives over guy with a Heavy Armed vehicle-dies. Tries it again-Wheel gets destroyed-vehicle explodes-dies. 10/10
6621	1	a	Really good game go check it out
6623	1	a	Great game : Nice graphic  Open world Fun playing with friends :D  P.S  i wish there are armory mode like arma 2  Also hope there will be more map coming soon :D
6625	1	a	Bought this for Battle Royale 100/10 people killed  (its the modern hunger games)= Forbes (Prepare for the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ engine except this time it doesnt look blurry af)= IGN (This is better than Dayz Yet Dayz has had more development time and money put in)= Bob Barker overall this should be rated 3 out of 4 armas Maybe arma 4 will be more unoptimized. But i still love it 'our games are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but you'll still buy them' -with love Dean Hall Buy this game its the most fun you'll have in awhile
6627	1	a	The only game where the bots have aimbot.
6629	1	a	Great game so many different game mods and is a great role-play game definatly worth the price. I highly advise buying this game!!
6631	1	a	10/10 would sell csgo skins for this game  Side note : Npcs have aimbot on lowest difficulty (on singleplayer) , but the end result is worth it
6633	1	a	10/10 would forget controls again
6635	1	a	Bought this game for the Breaking point (Dayz) mod,but i decided to give Epoch and Altis life a try.It was a blast i had a great time playing with friends,so i tought i should play the campaign,i'm sorry to say that it was horrible,the AI was dumb as F*ck even at the hightest level of difficulty,and sometimes game would crash at the end of a cutscene(although this might be an issue on my end).So overall i think that arma 3 is a great choice for those who want to play online,if you are looking for a good singleplayer campaign you might wanna avoid arma 3.
6637	1	a	Arma 3 is perfect !!! my only complain is about the game is not 100% optimized i still drop frames altho i have i7 4790 oc and 970 gtx oc 4 gb , i hope they will optimize it soon as we know there wont be Arma 4 soon
6639	1	a	Fun Fun and more Fun get a play with me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6641	1	a	Pretty good game, only downside about it is that its a hardware â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, will hog your computer like sasha grey sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :/  10/10 would get sniped out of their jet while going at 500 km/h at 700 metres
6643	1	a	Server waiting simulator 2020
6645	1	a	Played altis life with my friends, we went for a cocaine run. We got big trucks and put offroad trucks in the back of our big trucks (yo dawg i heard you like trucks) We made it through the border to the cocaine field fine All of a sudden a another truck pulls up besides us, what must be a 10 year old child armed to the teeth jumps out, 'Bonjour!' &gt;Canada Not knowing a word of french my canadian friends exchange words as we gather raw cocaine for processing. We fill our trucks and the kid follows us in a 5 truck convoy We make it through the border fine, we stop because squeaky broke the wheels on his truck somehow. All of a sudden we hear a helicopter, its getting closer and closer, everyones looking. At this point hes right above us, hovering We all panic and take off flooring it at like 90km/h down the highway, Eventually we get pretty close to the cocaine lab, the helo broke away from us, we thought we were in the clear &gt;police APC joins the chase &gt;ITS NOT POLICE IN THE APC We all panic and split, my one friend is pursued by the APC, while the other two make it to the cocaine lab fine (for now) I am trying to break away from my friend because hes banking towards me in his truck with the rogue APC in pursuit I eventually make it far away, the helo returned and was chasing me now â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ getting heavy, im away from my friends all by myself getting chased by a helicopter, the guy is yelling at me in french and trying to stop me and steal my truck out of my big truck thats full of raw cocaine. I keep heading towards Altis capital Kavala, the chopper breaks away from me and goes towards it probably expecting me to sell my cocaine there. The pilots a dumbass and I manage to escape far away as my friends are shot dead at the lab. I make it to another city in 10 minutes, safe from the chase now. I was the only survivor of that chase.  Screenshot of the chase below  http://gyazo.com/b39c718d58262619a302babd0eba2071     (Eventually my friends got a moderator in the servers TS because we thought they freekilled us, but it turns out they could shoot us if there was an obvious pursuit and we werent stopping, and that they could take 50% of our inventory from our trucks, but they couldnt take our trucks and chop them, praise peaceful canadian servers. After a long discussion in french which i couldnt understand they said it was all RP and we all enjoyed it for the most part.)  10/10 best RP experience I have had in a video game.  The campaign to this game is really hard, but enjoyable.
6647	1	a	Rappelled from a chinook with my mates. Last guy caused the chopper to explode.  10/10
6649	1	a	Me and one of my friends are playing on a Insurgency Startis server when is heli goes down. I get sent out on a rescue mission when my chopper, which is flying over him, gets hit by Anti-Air and goes down hard. He comes over and revies me only to relise that we are right next to an enemy base with a MORA circiling it. We manged to take the zone only left with the MORA still rolling. My friend picks up a launcher with only one rocket. 'Make it count' I say. He misses. The MORA turns and sees us then we scatter. Behind the MORA was a Offroader with a machien gun mounted on the back, which we imediatly run for, relising its our only chance. We make it. I drive while my friend shoots all the while the MORA is chasing us. Bullets are flying in all directions. We finnaly lose the MORA and end up in the AO, Agios Efstratios. Im driving with my friend on the outskirts of town when we get blow up. By four IED's. I die but my friend lives. We then come under motor fire, my friend still somehow, alive. He revives me and make it across town. We've captured the AO and everyone on the servers celebrating, except or OPFOR. One of them snipes my friend in the back. while the sniper reloads, I fireman carry him over a hill under cover. I patch him up and we rain motor fire all over the city.  9/10 would swim with fishes again.
6651	1	a	shot a tank with a javelin, 5 guys popped out and exploded.
6653	1	a	whats the diffrence between buying normal arma 3 and buying arma 3 digital deluxe edition because it seems you pay for 5 euro's more for absolutly nothing.........
6655	1	a	Killed a guy over 1100 meters with the gm6 lynx. I had the best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  10/10
6657	1	a	10/10  Pros: Guns Greece GUNNS Good maps Awesome RP Mod(s)  Cons: No Shotguns Kavala is Lag city No other cons
6659	1	a	If you ever want to know what war is, this game and the people in it will do it for you. Foxtrot Alpha/10
6661	1	a	There is the type of gamer who loves realistic games, then theres those players who want to be a bulldog style being, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a tank with a baby 'lil 'nade
6663	1	a	Pew pew, boom, argl.  11/10.
6665	1	a	Flying around in one of the jets showing off my 'Wonderful' skills, I'm flying about 10 meters above the ground trying to be cool, only to soon realize that I hit some electrical wires and died. Give Bohemia your F'in money!
6667	1	a	I only really play Over/E Poch, and from my experience its a great game. You have moments when helis blow up for no reason, or you die to stairs but when you look past that, the skys the limit, to building bases, collecting weapons, starting firefights with your neighbours, or making peace treatys. this game is great.
6669	1	a	I played RolePlaying and got harassed by a bunch of french guys. It was fun.
6671	1	a	Love this game! I like it because it is tactical and not COD. The ways you can tackle a mission is amazing!
6673	1	a	One of the best games i ever played! I love the game in general but the mods like Atlatis life, Breaking point are so fun..  I really think everyone shoud try this game out!
6675	1	a	you can shoot snakes
6677	1	a	i want to play it so bad 
6679	1	a	Good game, good graphics, flying cars, broken physics  11/10 would fly again
6681	1	a	Well for start off i love Arma 3 its an amazing military simulator and its really fun to play with friends on servers like; life , wasteland , breaking point and more mission files to enjoy! But im really dissapointed at the same time. Arma cut MAJOR corners in development and is very glitchy.You fall through stairs , get stuck in rocks and sometimes d-sync which isnt fun at all cause you loose all your stuff if you die or if your hurt, loose the advantage in a gun fight.I wish Arma brought out a patch which fixes all of these bugs but in all , this is a really good game and you should buy it if you like first person shooters.
6683	1	a	Mixed emotions about this one... Bought it when it was 40 bucks, kinda wish I didn't. Only real good parts about this are customizing levels of your own. Custom KOTH servers are good too. Other than that, I didn't really enjoy this. I was hoping a lot more from Arma 3. Arma 2 still has unlimited gameplay in it. RP servers, and normal servers. If you want a good war sim, this is pretty good. If you want a semigood war sim with basically unlimited gameplay, Arma 2. I don't exactly RECOMMEND this game, but it's pretty okay.  6.4/10
6685	1	a	great game with great mods. the game requires patience and alot of time to get into since 1 game might last +12h. the game doesnt have constaint action but when it does its very tense and nice since all it takes is 1-3 shots and your dead. the game has a massive map somewhere around 270 squarekilometers giving you lots of space to run around aimlessly if you dont know what to do. the game has multiple different vehicle types such as: civilian cars, ATV's, APC's, tanks, jets, helicopters, armored cars, boats and submarines. you have lots of choices in this game and the game needs thinking. you cant just run in middle of city with an machinegun holding the trigger and hoping to do something useful. the instant you get spotted running in middle of open field you will most likely die. arma is a great game series and they have tons of player made mods. arma 3 finally got dayz aswell for those who dont care about arma itself, sure theres dayz standalone but arma 3 dayz breaking point has somewhere like 500 zombies in a city who walk slowly isntead of empty cities with tom the floorzombies. in arma 3 dayz breaking point zombies are a treath and will swarm you if you stay in one place for too long. but anyways performance of the game is not the best, you will need a high end pc to run it properly. you can check if you can run it from  canyourunit.com  if you think you can run it and you have the patience to play i would recommend this game.
6687	1	a	This game is breath-taking, whether you like fast-paced gunfights, long-range sniper duels, monster-trucking it with M1A2 Slammer tanks, playing Ace Combat with incredibly fluid movement, raiding a small outpost of hostile forces with a attack helicopter, playing a role in week long, server-wide wars, doing night raids on an enemy research facility, setting up a UAV to perform reconnissance on enemy camps, packing your scuba gear and checking out the lost treasures of Altis and Stratis, or just hopping in a plane and enjoying the wide, vast, beauty of this game! ArmA 3 really dominates the 'realistic, military, video game/simulator' genre. Combine some wicked creativity with ArmA 3's mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios. In the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game, such as new weapons, vehicles, clothing, and even entire maps! ArmA 3's customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns, attachments for them, and other equipment to match the situation your in. If you feel like playing solo, ArmA 3 has totally revamped its Campaign mode to keep the player's attention and actually immerse you in the ArmA universe, or forget the single-player all together and go play good cop-bad cop on Altis Life, a user created gamemode, or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in Wasteland, also a user-created gamemode. If none of this satisfies you, then you can always just build your own mission, so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that I guarntee you is as close as you'll get to war before enlisting!
6689	1	a	I'm going to make this review extremely short. This game is a very extreme sandbox/warfare simulator, I HIGHLY recommend this game for anybody able to run it. This game is extremely fun with Zeus-- the multiplayer sandbox/warfare simulator. You will not be dissapointed.
6691	1	a	i love arma 3 buy it buy it buy it
6693	1	a	Great game, great mods, great community. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.
6695	1	a	Paradropped in my underwear, landed on top of an enemy tank and died in my underwear. 11/10 would do it again!
6697	1	a	Very fun to use. The graphics and realism aspect of the game is extreme. The firefights are intense, and it's easy to be immersed into the combat. The vehicle (Including Aircraft, submarines, helicopters) interiors are nice to look at as well.  Zues: Before this addon I couldn't get up close to watch a firefight without getting shot. This makes a great RTS, and a pleasurable theater of war.  Go Karts: I was kind of confused about this addon. 'A war simulator with Go Karts?' I got it, tried it out, and to be honest it wasn't that bad. Bohemia Interactive was trying something new. it was apreciated.
6699	1	a	An amazing game, I recommend to only players who have patience and are skilled. This is not an easy game to play.
6701	1	a	Not many games will amaze me, but this one did. I did not belive that Arma 3 would stand a chance to Arma 2/OA but it gives it a good run for its money. Only downside to Arma 3 is the lack of weapons and vehicles but mods seem to patch that right up, good job Bohimia Interactive
6703	1	a	This game is excellent!  If you are looking for a realistic military shooter, you got it. But becareful and check your specs, cause its hell on the machine.
6705	1	a	Really cool game if you are used to shooter games. It is very intense and realistic, you can get killed pretty quickly and vehicles can blow up easy. Also the maps are very beautiful and great to explore with lots of hiding spots. Arma 3 has a large range of weapons that can suit all playing styles so I highly recomend it for people who are reasonalbly experienced at shooter games.
6707	1	a	Arma is a great game to simulate combat. This game contains a bunch or military tactics weapons and movements you can think of.  the military tactics include basic training, staying low profile and taking care of eachother. In multiplayer, the medic class can be very useful if used correctly. BUT that goes for every class, not just the medic.  The weapons are very nicely designed. The look fantastic, they even have those hybrid scopes (The ones with a scope, and ontop a micro red dot sight or RDS). The only problem that everyone runs into - which is intentionally implemented in the game - the shortage of ammo. You can just spray and pray. No if you do that, your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.  The movements are really realistic too. It's overlooked, but if used the right way, they can be the difference between life and death. In one situtation (this gets a bit off topic for a sec) we had a teammate who at the beginning killed our entire team. We all spawned in, he waited and deployed his bipod, and killed like 20 of us. When this was happening the enemy was getting the upper hand. We were all killing him and people turned on eathother, and somehow we picked up our â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and faught the enemy, who had spawn trapped us. The advanced movements allowed me and 1 other person to roll in the grass to the left flank, got behind them and killed a pretty good amount, which allowed our team to push in and capture the base.  In conclusion, it's a great game. BUT way to difficult for me. The controls are a bit complicated to me; I'm used to Battlefield and CoD. This game is FANTASTIC but I hate to say it, but the realism is too much for me :/ I refunded it but Do NOT hesitate to buy this product. Always remember, there's always the refund button.  I did buy it again then forget to close it, now I cant refund anymore, lol its a cool game though.
6709	1	a	Great mil sim. Can be play for eternity, thanks to mods and mission editor
6711	1	a	This is a great gam if you're interested in military simulators. I've found quite a few Veterens playing this. It does take a pretty beefy computer, but hey, if you can manage 60 FPS in a 200 kmÂ² map, it's quite beautiful. For true realism, I recommend the ACE3 mod, but if you're okay with that, explore mods,   9/10 in my view
6713	1	a	This is by a wide margin my favorite game on steam. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT FOR THOSE WHO WHINE ABOUT CLUNKINESS AND POOR OPTIMIZATION. The clunkiness is what keeps this game down to earth and realistic and part of what makes this game great but it is not for some tastes. The optimization, yeah your not gonna get 60fps very often no matter your pc, it is still very very playable sitting fround 40-50 fps constant. Thsi is a military simulation sandbox which means the user created sontent is what makes it great. Check out the workshop for the best mods. I sugest battly royale, king of the hill, a3l, and exile.   Fantastic game 10/10 
6715	1	a	A really great Military Simulator.  The amount of content and detail in this game is great and will give you hours of fun to have! From a great SP campaign to a diverse and intense MP along with CO OP missions with friends, there is endless content in ArmA 3!!
6717	1	a	You love war? you will love this ...
6719	1	a	Really amazing :P
6721	1	a	9/10 Best Sandbox Simulation. Truly enchances the feel of FPS to send you to war. With huge amounts of mods to choose from, it makes it create a different feel no other game creates. Highly recommend this game.
6723	1	a	AI killed me with a rocket from 1000 meters while driving at high speed on Exile 10/10 would get blown up again
6725	1	a	Arma 3 is a Massive Multiplayer action based game with TONS of activites for you to do like Roleplaying, Scavenge and kill others or team up and take over an area or making you're OWN server with whatever you wish to do. Arma 3 also is best known ofr the ammount of mods they have and they have a lot of it! Arma is a 3rd to 1st person moduale and is a very nice game to play especially with friends. I do in-courage all of you to get this game as it is a nice game to play. Although, it does have some bugs in the game and an amount of exploiters (not that many, don't worry) but set aside from that Arma 3 was worth the money.
6727	1	a	KIng of hill / Altis life / battle royale / breakking point and alot of mods in ONE GAME &lt;3
6729	1	a	Having owned this since the alpha, I can say I highly recommend it. This beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes, but stunning graphics as well. It has a much better optimization than Arma 2, but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. Modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. Breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy DayZ. All together an amazing game and a huge step-up from Arma 2.
6731	1	a	Arma 3 is one of those games you hate, but you still play it because it is so good.  Arma 3 is unique in how it plays out but without doubt has some flaws. A common problem is optimization; this problem is a big one considering if you would like to play on a server with a decent amount of players, you will be ploughed down to 30 frames per second or below. It can be a horrible experience. However, with the right tweaks to the game you can easily run it at 100 fps+ (in singleplayer) with decent specs (if you would consider a 560 ti and i5 3570 as somewhere between good and bad). I suspect that the framerate problem on servers may because how the Arma server is designed, but that is for bohemia to improve.  For out this Arma 3 is a brilliant designed game in the manner that pretty much everything you'll find on the server browser is user made. To the extent where a mod or mission may completely overcome the 'Military simulator' aspect of the game. At one point I even found a mod where you played as a robot car war machine, just like that old tv show with the bots fighting in an arena.   If you are into tactics and survival, wasteland might be the place for you, with the constant feeling of being watched by someone with a very big weapon, while attempting to gear up so you can fight back. Alternatively, the great feeling of wiping a 5-man squad purely based on your skill and intelligence, by outplaying them. If you are into big battles, king of the hill is something you may like. With giant battles going on, including infantry, armoured cars, and air support. Even if these things are not for you, Altis life might be. With the biggest (or one of the biggest) player-base in Arma, the incredible Altis life is really something in its own. You start out by being a civilian with nothing, where you get to choose a path of Justice as a police officer, medic or something alike. Alternatively, if you strive after being the biggest drug lord on the server by harvesting crops and processing them into drugs to sell. On the other hand, if you simply just want to pluck apples for a little cash you can do that as well. For you Garryâ€™s mod veterans, this is pretty much the DarkRP of Arma.  And if none of these are something that you'd spend time playing, why not grab a text editor and start scripting a mission exactly how you'd want it!  Though I recommend this game, I would like to point out that it is not that fun to play alone; you definitely need some friends to play with.
6733	1	a	Love it.
6735	1	a	My mother would probably scorn me by saying this about any media related to war, but...  This game is magnificent, beautiful, epic and brilliant. the sound-track is not too bad either! I absolutely love the way the game controls, especially compared to the stiff nature of its predecessor, Arma 2. This is particularly noticable when focusing on vehicles. In other words the vehicles handle like a dream due to the improved physics model (PhysX). apart from the third party physics engine implementation, the engine seems to have seen new additions and reconfigurations, such as the improved AI (still not perfect, especially when driving). The textures are decent, considering the scale of the game, but definatly an improvement over Arma 2. Animations are miles better. The details of objects such as weapons, vehicles and various common geometry scattered around the large expanse of the two vanilla maps (Stratis and Altis), are great!   I find great delight in oogling at such a realistic landscape, which in the case of the vanilla maps, apparently are modelled from real locations, Agios Efstratios (Stratis) and Lemnos (Altis)! There is a lot of content on offer with Arma 3, notably the ZEUS gamemode which is really exciting to play. Its when a player takes control of sort of an RTS perspective, defending, attacking and messing around with spawning objects and AI while other players run around as normal soldiers, adapting to the unpredictability of ZEUS's actions. It's quite a fun game mode and no two sessions are the same. There are a load of other standard game modes along with the ability to play scenarios either made with the editor, workshop or built in ones such as 'Escape from Altis', which is one of my favourite scenarios provided by BIS, its great to play with some friends. In fact, with a clan or a load of friends this game is a lot more fun. Don't get me wrong the Single player content which is similar, is also really really good.   Speaking of the single player experience, one of the most notable additions to this iteration of the series is the decent campaign. missions are good and diverse, making use of the space it has to play with. As well as the good voice acting, which seems to immerse me into the war torn greek islands of Stratis and Altis.  Despite all the good things in the game, of course it has problems. One that sticks out like a sore thumb to me is the performace relative to the hardware. Also the fact that the game does not seem to spread the workload across all four of the cores my CPU has to offer; The AI only take one thread, causing servere framerate loss when trying to play with lots of troops running around. Which is what I enjoy doing in sandbox games like this, most of the time. Servers seem to have problems, too. As connecting to a friends, has failed on multiple occasions, seeming to be randomly stubborn towards other players joining your server, despite inviting them.  This is no casual shooter. This is a military simulation. This is ARMA.....3.................puts glasses on, gets up, walks off into the distance.  &lt;obligatory 10/10 ign mlg 420 reference&gt;
6737	1	a	Open world modable realistic fps/tps? who could say no?
6739	1	a	I waited to play this after release because of some issues and not having any friends to play it with, I started playing it now a couple days ago and it is fantastic. The mods available for the game give unlimited content. Best shooter out atm imo.
6741	1	a	Great game, full of underwear.
6743	1	a	Really fun fps. Enjoy it much more than Arma 2. The DayZ mod here isnt that great, but you gotta make do with what you got.
205	0	a	I personally dont like it becuase out of 13 hours of game play 10 of it was trying to fix errors popping up in the game. I have tryed EVERYTHING and some of them are not fixable. It has made me lose my mind.
6745	1	a	I have to say, This game is dam realistic :), AND PERFECT! even without that mod called DayZ
6747	1	a	This game is intensely fun, and has some very intricate mods that allow you to get more immersed in whichever style of fps gameplay you like. From Strategic Warfare, to COD-style run and gun.
6749	1	a	Just Buy It
6751	1	a	Arma 3 is in every way better than its previous version Arma 2, its still has its bugs but nothing compared to Arma 2, the Graphics are absolutely great and as always, the Gunfights are amazing, nothing like battlefield or call of duty, good planning and tactics are just as important as been able to be a good shot, exactly what you want in a tactical, Military Simulator.   From my own Experience mods are the best way to play, And I can easily see myself Putting in triple the amount of Hours that i currently have, the only reason I would stop playing Arma 3 would be if Arma 4 got released.   Only Downside is that you will need a good PC to run it, its demanding but its worth every Penny.
6753	1	a	By far. the best game i have ever played.
6755	1	a	Arma 3 &amp; Dayz r not just a normall games to play , it's a life to live .
6757	1	a	Scares the crap out of me when im being shot at
6759	1	a	Jog endlessly accross vast landscapes and get killed by people you never saw. Reminds me of all the things that sucked in the real Army. The Community also emulates all the retardation that surrounds the operation of Armed Forces. If you want tedious hours of boredom, unforgiving gameplay, a friend circle of maniacs and so forth, then yes, please do purchase this game.   Great game, I love it. A must have.
6761	1	a	brilliant graphics and amazing military experience ! MEIN FURHER STEINER.......... 
6763	1	a	Another great game in the arma seris, keep it up Bohemia because I'm not tired of this yet! 9/10
6765	1	a	Arma is love, Arma is life. No better simulation on the market. Taking down 5-10 in a single engagement can feel more rewarding than an entire playthrough of any other military game. CoDF*gs need not apply. As the saying goes: Wussies play CoD, boys play Battlefield, ARMA is for men ;)
6767	1	a	A solid update to a solid franchise.
6769	1	a	Amazing! Even though you will not play with our Modern Weapons(You get Future-ish) the campaign is still worthy to play and the vehicles finally has a neat suspension. 9.5/10
6771	1	a	10:10
6773	1	a	The best military sim out there!
6775	1	a	Not the best city builder I've ever played, but it did quite a good job at simulating modern military combat
6777	1	a	A beautifully done, full-on military simulation that is a lot of fun to play.
6779	1	a	Great game. played it while it was free. enjoyed it. now i want it
6781	1	a	One of the greatest games I have ever played. Visuals are stunning, realism is incredible, comuunity is mature and respectful, lots of different firearms and vehicles to drive and shoot. Wasteland is probably the most addictive and likeable game mode I have ever played. This game is sole reason why I bought my PC in the first place. Get this game if you dont have it yet you wont be disapointed
6783	1	a	The little time i've had in ARMA III, really goes to show that this is a very heavy Milsim game, and is amazingly fun, highly realistic, with great and smoth controls that never get in the way. ARMA III fixed ARMA II's more clunky controls, and added different stances besides, standing, crouching and prone. This adds a new dynamic to the game, and allows for things like cover that would be useless at the standing, and still realvealing at crouching, you can 'Crouch-prone', or crouch very lowly, much lower then normal crouching, which makes combat more dynamic and much more fun. The only thing in ARMA that is a killer is stamina, because it its a milsim game, stamina will always be your number one enemy, and more of the threat in a fire fight then the guy shooting you, because you cannot steady your aim.
6785	1	a	This is the most adicting, most realistic war game out there. Don't come and expect COD because this is real war. It takes time to get some things done just like in real life. This is a war SIMULATOR not a fast paced shootem up FPS. Best most addicting game i have ever played. I used to be a Battlefield junkie but this takes the cake sorry to say.
6787	1	a	This game is very intertaining. You can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. I find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. This is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. You can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.
6789	1	a	Extremely good game! Well made and all round so much fun! from plain TDM, to Altis life, you will never get bored of this game, especially if you download all the mods for it! Endless hours of fun! Nuf' Said!
6791	1	a	I bought a brand new gaming desktop just so I could play it on 'Ultra'  No number can describe this game's greatness  Infinity/0 
6793	1	a	Amazing game, such an improvement on everything that was bad about the second wrapped up in the most beautiful package I've ever opened.
6795	1	a	3/10 looks nice but basicaly nothing works everything's buggy as hell cant even walk down stairs without being killed by the map
6797	1	a	As good as computer gaming gets for military sims.
6799	1	a	one of my fav games
6801	1	a	Arma 3 is a outstanding game with such immersive gameplay and nice controls that feel right at home. The game also has a nice VR Training mode to start learning about its mechanics and controls about the game.  Arma 3 is also the best way to get a PTSD within 5 minutes of gameplay
6803	1	a	I love this game But i do not like the singleplayer
6805	1	a	This is one of the best games on pc for pvp a must need game if you need some
6807	1	a	Although I dislike Arma 3 as a game due to it's attitudes towards DLC as well as the futuristic setting, I can appreciate its capacity for milsim. The modding community makes up for it's shortcomings and results in a fantastic experience.
6809	1	a	i likes that it was combat based and had all war vecles the only thing i dilikes was the lack of maps to play one but i know this takes a long time to build maps so i would still recemend this to my freinds as a good game otherwise this is the best well built war game ive ever played not laggy  plz note i dont atuallly own the game i played the free weekend  anyway i would love to receive a steam key from somone
6811	1	a	Really great game and worth your money and time. Nothing else to add.
6813	1	a	Awesome game, pick up a copy if you've haven't already, prices seem to drop quite well. Tonnes of mod support and new gamemodes coming out, its definitely worth a buy if you've played things like DarkRP, and Battlefield in my opinion. :)
6815	1	a	Best MilSim out there yet. Truly recommend it! Great game for those interested in teamwork play and so on :D
6817	1	a	Played Altis Life.  Cop chased me, I turn corner, stop. He turns corner, pops tires on a bush. I hoon it. Got away 10/10
6819	1	a	listen, i dont really give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about planning out huge tactical sieges online with my friends or mods or realism or anything like that i just really appreciate that this is a game where i can run myself over with an unmanned jeep
6821	1	a	Very much enjoyed this game!!! So many servers to play that are all unique and enjoyable as the rest!!! I would happily give this game a 10/10 with no hesitation or doubt 
6823	1	a	This is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. The sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. The only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.
6825	1	a	A Brilliant, yet realistic Military Game. As expected from the Arma Series!
6827	1	a	Just like Human Centipede, this game is medically and scientifically accurate.  Just like Apollo 13, you will have a lot of problems.  Just like Shakespeare, it will end in tragedy. Just like NASA, you will not have enough funds to continue missions. Just like your grandma, you will end up as ashes. Just like Boy Meets World... except face first. Just like Die Hard: With a Vengeance... except no vengeance.  Just like a Japanese Kamikaze pilot... except unintentional. Just like your girlfriend's virginity... all will be lost. Just like gay marriage... you will eventually get close. Just like an adopted baby, you will long for reuniting with mother moon.  Just like a failed marriage, you wonder where it all went wrong. Just like an Islam extremist, you will scream prior to your death. Just like a cookie, you will crumble. Just like Selena Gomez, you will have one good hit, but can't replicate it no matter how hard you try. Just like a crazed sociopath Jebediah will ALWAYS smile, whether he's being thrown into the sun or on a fire-reentry back into Kerbin Orbit. - (Cobalt Lightning) Just like you have Alzheimers, you will forget your parachute - (Austin) Just like war, It never changes. - (Dr. Strangelove)  Just like Peppi you'll use the boost to get through. - (Kodiak) Just like Falco there will be something wrong with the G-diffuser Just like Slippy, 'Help me.....help me!' Just like a large burrito. It looks delicious, but always ends up a terrible mess. Just like a Stormtrooper you'll never hit your target Unlike Luke Trusting your instincts will get you killed Unlike Star Wars, the only force you need to be concerned about is Mass X Acceleration Just like a necromancer, you'll have absolutely no life - (Kodiak) Just Like North Korea, The Rocket will never launch - (Sir Panda) Just like a Space Marine, we call it Steel Rain - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like Skyrim, your steed will only be able to fly for minutes at a time Just like SimCity, you'll quickly learn your building skills are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Just like a Scout, Jebediah runs fast and dies a virgin - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like your mom's house, one mistake and you're out - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like Russia. You can only love it or hate it. - (Selina Kyle) Just like EA, you promote it as a good thing, but it turns out to be a bad thing - (NOSCOPE) just like a Steam sale, you will use the funds that you don't have. - (Broccoli) Just Like Adventure Time, Grab your friends &amp; go to very distant lands. - (Kanjzo) Just like IPhone 6, It will bend. - (Kanjzo) Just like this review, f*cking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, dude - (Chris Atkins) Just like a bomb ... BOOOOM!!! - (Chasew) [very clever haha] Just like Star Trek movies, every other launch will suck. - (#SwagnarTheSweg) Just like a heart transplant, it was all going so well... - (Nigel Burke's Wristwatch)
6829	1	a	Great game 
6831	1	a	Arma 3 is an A-MA-ZING game! It offers a lot of gamemodes and that makes this game incredibly fun to play. Over the past two weeks i have become addicted to ARMA (in a good way) :-). So, where are you waiting for? Buy it already!
6833	1	a	I loved every detail&amp;feature in this game except the DLC, where you'll have to pay $15 for two helicopters and to remove a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ kind of advertisement in-game.  As I said except those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ money farming DLC's, you'll have to play this game with mods to have fun, in my opinion. If you want realism you should get ACE, but I high recommend Exile&amp;Epoch mods as I had the most fun with these mods.  And, this game is overpriced, in my opinion.
6835	1	a	a wonderfully flexible, detailed and immersive milsim.  great modding support and a community that doesnt dissapoint.  a worthy addition to your gaming collection
6837	1	a	arma3 is a good war game simulator i have been playing this alot and i recommend to buy it if you like war game simulators.
6839	1	a	Arma 3 is an excellent game but you have to know when to stop.
6841	1	a	Arma never fails to impress, and Arma 3 is no exception. The game looks beautiful and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy and team work with their shooters.
6843	1	a	It's good, but not for it's 50 bucjk price tag
6845	1	a	It's cool if you like playing with people who take this way too seriously.  EDIT 2/14/16  ArmA 3 actually taught me how to tread water.I'm being serious here.It actually taught me how to tread water.I'm a great swimmer now and I can probably be a Marine Raider since they're more bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ than Navy SEALs.
6847	1	a	One of the best shooters out there on PC, playing it like CoD or Battlefield will just result in death. This game requires skill to progress, getting injured effects your characters movement and hiding does not regenerate health. Play this game if you want a challenge.
6849	1	a	I must say this is the best shooting game I have ever played.Maybe it's quite unfriendly to the newcomers but in others aspects it is epic.Highly recommended to military lovers.
6851	1	a	The best war simulator there is. Plus its on sale now... GO BUY IT!!!
6853	1	a	Arma is a great series of games and the scope of each title is always more impressive than it's predecessor. Yes, like those it follows ARMA 3 has it's bugs, but these are in no way irritating. At most, they are hilarious.... because you become immersed with experience of being a lethal weapon, methodically removing enemy AI from their short lived lives, when all of a sudden the yells and laughs of comrades 'hoovering' in a tank or being insta-killed by randomly exploding vehicles that touched a small pebble, breaks the cycle!   It's a game you have to try out. You can get into the game quite easily and add to your knowledge as you go. But don't be a lone wolf and complain it was boring. Arma is about team work... and not your Call of Duty or Battlefield TDM capture the flag balls...but actual teamwork where communication and learning your place in a squad keeps you all alive! The A.I. on this game is 'effective' - they will suppress, they will surpise and they definetly do more than just flank you from obvious places. It's very dynamic and lonewolfs die quickly... a good squad will have a much higher survival rate!   So get yourself in a game, be a local on the server and join in with 'regulars' to have the best experience.  There is a lot to learn, but ARMA 3's new tutorial system is far superior to older versions of the game and many of the players online are very helpful.   Heaps of content &amp; the workshop has lots more additions. Goto Armaholic for the best and widest range of addons. My only gripe is that they can still be somewhat difficult to install. So it maybe best to use a loader.   I'm a big fan of the Arma series and this one has raised the bar again!  Get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s off COD &amp; BF and play a real game!!!   11/10
6855	1	a	Joined altis life, got ran over by some dude who was singing. 10/10
6857	1	a	Pilot Jumpsuit Army vs. Iranians From Outer Space.  And some greek guys that suck.
6859	1	a	This was very awesome FPS games! Nice Graphic and there's so many mode on it ....so it's not easy to make you become bored. So fun if u guy's playing together with best friend's or family's. U guy's must have this game!  ^_^V
6861	1	a	So I joined a terrorist group. After training, I went on our biggest job, where I killed a bunch of enemies with a single jet and they were all in a massive building. Those steel beams didn't hold out. Then I went home and got this game. Pretty good.  9/11 would allahu akbar again
6863	1	a	it's realy a cool game while playing with friends
6865	1	a	This is one of the best games i've ever played! I recommend buying this game.
6867	1	a	took a mortar launcher to space  10/10
6869	1	a	11/10
6871	1	a	It is such a good game all though it run's like a b*tch
6873	1	a	Found a guy wearing a Turban. Shot the guy, stole the turban, got decimated by an IED.  11/10 would jihad again
6875	1	a	After playing Altis life for the first time, I accomplished holding a guy up at a peach tree field outside Kola, or however it's spelled, I didn't know how to pick the peaches so i made the guy pick em for me at gunpoint, I then made him take off his cloths, why I did this? I don't know, but it was very amusing. He picked a couple hundred peaches, handed them to me, after doing so he booked it to my truck, which i stupidly left unlocked, he got in my truck, pulled a u-turn and hit me, I some how survived this, with very low health, like, very god damn low. He had to get rid of the evidence, including me. He pulled me off the road and behind one of the houses, he waited for me to bleed out. I told him he didn't have to do it, that he was a good person, he just sat there and waited. After a few moments, the light faded, It was game over, I goofed. Best first time playing Arma III ever. 10/10
6877	1	a	Negative reviews fueled by angsty console junkies â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off that they can't hipshoot and bunny hop everywhere. If you really like unreal tournament style shooters, go play something else. If you think battlefield or call of duty is too hard core, this game will hand you your â™¥â™¥â™¥ and send you back to the forums crying.   There's a reason some military groups use it as a training simulator. It's not for punk kids.
6879	1	a	Most action pack game yet, amazing two way to finish off the campaign. I really recommend this game if your into a lot of strategy and firefights.
6881	1	a	Its fun so far.
6883	1	a	After almost 1500+ hours of playing thise game I feel inclined to write a review.  I don't think I can even describe how much fun I've had playing this game, the amount of immersion, realism and tactical experience is literally of the charts. There's so much to do with this game it's as if it will never end. From Sandbox to milsim to just Co-op missions literally every part of it is a blast with friends. I've met some of my greatest friends through this and If anyone is looking for a truly social gaming experience I cannot recommend this more. It's a definite buy for anyone interested in the military and tactical genre or anything of the such.
6885	1	a	ArmA 3. A 'tacticool' shooter. Sorry, that was terrible.  ArmA 3 is an apparent military simulator. I'd personally call it a casual simulator, considering the bugs (the engine is riddled with them, but the devs are active on fixing bugs and creating new ones in the process). There are issues such as: - The movement system (transitions can be jarring- a sprint can becoming a walk just because the terrain is *slightly* steeper, which has got me killed more than a few times in the past, though it can be solved by running in weird ways up hills) - Over zealous stamina system (60lb of equipment will drain your stamina whilst jogging in a few minutes, 10lb will do so in a few seconds later) and issues like that. The guys I play with tend to disable it, and for good reason. - 'Futuristic' theme through the use of various real world vehicles and weapons - no AKs, M4/16s and countless other classic weapons we all know and love. Sucks, in my opinion. - Really dumb ai. Some improvements over the ArmA 2 ai - ai reacts faster and better, but can react a little... Overzealous. A single soldier in a good position can lock up squads by taking random shots, preventing them from being ordered around (units love to crawl when under fire), requiring a lot of micromanaging as a squad leader - if you're playing as Zeus or using High Command for squads, good luck.  There are many others, but I can't think of them at the moment. But, now for some good news.  You can install mods, fixing a large number of gameplay related issues. Sadly the first issue with the movement system can't be fixed (or hasn't, at least), but the stamina system has been fixed by a number of mods to be somewhat more realistic and more managable.  Mods such as RHS: Escalation (the US forces and Russian Armed Forces parts) plus the HLC packs solve the lack of modern weapons - the two mods / packs are my faviourites for this sort of thing.  Various realism mods around such as AGM and CSE also help improve the realism of the game.  DLC is also free with the game, sort of. Similar to what they did in ArmA 2, you get the content but with some restrictions - so you can play with people who have it, though you may not be able do access all the features, and there may be some annoying notifications. ;p
6887	1	a	BEST SIMULLATOR OF WAR IN THE WORLD!!!
6889	1	a	Best game ive ever played tbh
6891	1	a	best military simulater out there lol
6893	1	a	Do you want to blast peoples skulls off from 2000 meters out?  Arma's got you covered.   Do you want to fall from the sky after the helicopter you were being towed by was hit by an air to air missile?  Arma's got you covered.  Have you ever dreampt about creating your own terrorist cell?  Arma's got you covered.  You will not get bored playing this game. You name it, there is workshop content that will cover your needs. Not to mention the thousands of mods that can be installed to customize your experience.   10/10 would jihad again  
6895	1	a	this game would be fun if I had any friends  #feelsbad
6897	1	a	10/10
6899	1	a	Best friggin game ever. Been playing Arma 2 for years now. Will play Arma 3 for years to come. If there is an aspect about this game you don't like, then theres probably a mod for that! Seriously, check out mods like Arma 3 life, epoch or breaking point. Arma 3 is not just a fun game by itself, but the mods make this any gaming experience you want it to be.   If you like FPS, this is really the only game you need!  
207	0	a	Fun if you like hearing the F word over and over and over and over again. lol I miss the days when games where about great graphics, great stories and amazing sounds. now it seems like all game developers do is build there games around the bad language. not worth my time or money. deleted it after the first 10 min.
6901	1	a	*has $100,000,000,000,* computer* - finally, a solid 25 frames per minute.
6903	1	a	it omg the bessssssssssssssssst game ever i love it i have met so meany nice peps on here 10/10
6905	1	a	arma is probably one of the best allround millsims there are to date and everyone loves it. this games puts you through highs and low, tough and easy times, sad, happy, angry and probably one of the best loving and most best game every
6907	1	a	Best game ive ever played tbh
6909	1	a	A solid sequel to Arma 2 but would fall short if it hadn't been for the workshop support.  Arma 2 with operation arrowhead is full of different vehicles and weapons for each faction not to mention some really great maps. Meanwhile Arma 3 does some stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and makes the CSAT and NATO tanks very similair and reuses their chassis for other vehicles. I understand that reusing the same chassis is supposed to make it futursitic but I think it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing boring.  - Post-Modern military theme is cool - Customization of loadouts - Easy to get workshop mods - Workshop quality control is non-existent - Vehicles are alright - They push their mods and expansions in the most annoying way possible - UI and FPS controls are improved - Maps are alright but nothing that really stands out or is very memorable - Runs similarly to Arma 2 despite looking much better -
6911	1	a	ARMA 3 is (one of) the best game(s) I have ever played - even after 2500+ h !   gameplay: 9/10 (Very complicated controls - at least at the start, you will need to put some time in optimizing them! But the movement system you get from that is amazing!)  graphics: 10/10 (It is a very good looking game)  sound: 10/10 (sounds amazing, if you hear the bullet crack over your head you will hope to see CAS engaging the enemys...)  performance: 7/10 (You need a very good processor to run arma 3 and it is not the best optimized game out there but it is a sandbox with massive modding support so if you look from that side its great)  conclusion: Very very good game!   I recommend this game! It offers something for everyone: Military sim (coop), RPG (life servers), FPS-styled gamemodes (king of the hill, wasteland), ...   Buy it, its worth the money!
6913	1	a	Not only has ARMA 3 provided countless hours of fun and a totally unique experience, but Bohemia Interactive should also be commended for their consumer-friendly conduct.
6915	1	a	*has $100,000,000,000,* computer* - finally, a solid 25 frames per minute.
6917	1	a	After nearly 1000 hours in ArmA3, I feel like I have gathered enough experience to review this game.   It's good.  
6919	1	a	Rated one of the best Simulator of this year, it needs some work, but mods help make it feel better made with the stock Arma 3 isn't good. Sure, it is the newest it still in development, i hope in the future they will add more vehicles and weapons
6921	1	a	The best MIl-Sim game on the market
6923	1	a	Great game !
6925	1	a	Literally using my friend's dead body as cover in desperation.       One of my best Memories.
6927	1	a	Not as good as ArmA 2.
6929	1	a	Not as good as ArmA 2.
6931	1	a	 Arma 3 has been on my list of games to get for a long time, my only disappointment is that I waited so long to get it. This is one of the best games I have played in 2015. I canâ€™t wait for some campaign based DLC.
6933	1	a	Still absolutely worth it
6935	1	a	Great game, but I wish it was easier to play a private game with friends.
6937	1	a	Personal Rating: 9/10 Replayability: High Budget: Affordable - The price has dropped enough.  Length: It's mostly multiplayer - the singleplayer campaign is... Very difficult.   I was a fan of Operation Flashpoint - Dragon Rising and Red River, as well as Arma II.  I have to admit, the same problems that plagued Arma II still ravage Arma III to a degree.  It's unnecessarily difficult to set your keyboard up for this game.  They've certainly improved on it, now the keyboard mapping recognizes double tapping a button and even holding it, versus just pressing it.   That said, a lot of things in this game, could be handled through smart menus rather than having buttons for it.   It becomes impossible to remember where everything is toggled for.   That said, the game is without a doubt the greatest military simulator I've ever seen, and the AI is actually fairly smart (except for the friendly AI which appears to be stupid in comparison - but I mostly think it's because the friendly AI is subject to much more scripting than the enemy AI).   The inventory system is a welcome change from Arma II that had an incredibly complicated inventory system, and the fact that you can change everything from your uniform to your weapon mods is super great!   The game is, like I said, very difficult in single player, because the enemy can spot you before you can reasonably spot the enemy - but that isn't because the game is unrealistic, it's because it's pretty difficult to spot an enemy on a 28 inch monitor in 1080p, if there is a simulated distance of 500 meters between you, and the enemy is wearing camuflage.  This game will probably be a good thing to try with occulous rift once it comes out. It doesn't help that the enemy soldiers use camuflage that is actually much better suited for the terrain you play in, during the campaign - not that it matters the other way around, because I don't think the AI is set to differentiate between camu patterns.   There is no melee combat in the game, which was a bit of a bummer for me, but I don't think you would ever get a chance to use it anyway, because as I mentioned, you will often end up spotted by an enemy long before you're even able to notice that combat has started around you.   The game lacks an easy mode, where you stop to be wounded after bandaging your wounds and being out of combat for a while - Of course, that wouldn't be realistic, but it would still make the game a little less hardcore for those that find the difficulty a bit too steep.   In operation flashpoint, when you reached a checkpoint, your squad was revived, wounds were healed and new squad members even spawned with full ammo.   In Arma III, I find myself running out of ammo very quickly, I'm only capable of carrying one rifle (an option to carry a rifle instead of a secondary weapon, such as a rocket launcher, would be welcome), and if I get hit at any point - It's going to affect the rest of the mission, and missions are very very long.   This is a bit too brutal for my liking - it wouldn't matter in a multiplayer game, but in a single player campaign where the missions are so long that I often feel like I could make a full time job out of playing the game, it's too much.   That said, you can't ask for a more realistic military infantry simulator. It very accurately represents what it feels like to be in the infantry.   The producers should have put in some optional missions that were skippable, showing some of the less exciting parts of being in the armed forces, such as building a camp, weapon and gear maintenance, dealing with a complicated and sometimes not 100% efficient chain of command and the many menial duties of being a soldier.   It'd be cool if there was a 'I'm military' mode that could be activated, which results in you being assigned to a fire team in your unit, instead of basically being a joker.   The AI in your unit does operate like a military unit, with proper 'fire and movement' maneuvers, but you're left out of this, because the producer knew the player wasn't necessarily going to be able to keep up with that, but some players have it the other way around, they sit there, confused, wondering why you're not getting advancement orders, why your team is acting like they have orders, but they didn't reach you.   That said, I think that it's GOOD that they did it like they did, because this game is supposed to be for everyone, and not just for people with military experience, but it wouldn't have taken them that much longer to incorporate a mode like that.   With the verdict that sometimes, the realism level in this game makes it TOO difficult to play through a limited interface, such as keyboard+mouse and monitor, then I can really recommend this game to anyone who likes military simulators.   It's not your average run of the mill FPS game though, so if you like high-paced and less punishing gameplay, I recommend something like battlefield instead.  
6939	1	a	+1
6941	1	a	Great game that offers many different game modes for all the hardcore and softcore gamers. It is much more fun to play with a group of friends since you will be up against majority of the time groups.
6943	1	a	Nothing is more fun than blowing up Persians with homodachis.
6945	1	a	Still absolutely worth it
6947	1	a	This game is a different breed. For both the positives and negatives that brings with it, this game is truly a different breed.  I can easily say the best times I've had playing a video game have been in this game. Those times don't come easy though, and most videos don't do those times justice. Arma 3 is full of quailty people, but as it's seen significant growth, also growing amounts of trolls and not-so-friendly players. If you can find a group of players with a similar mindset and enough talent, you will have a fantastically unique time in this game.  Unlike most mainstream shooters, this game is almost entirely community based. Sure, Arma 3 itself is controlled and developed by Bohemia, but once you get in-game you are most likely playing a creation of another player. This completely opened ended sandbox of opportunities also has it's downsides though.  For one, performance isn't top notch. The game doesn't perform horribly in most cases, but a poorly scripted mission may lead to a drastic FPS decrease. Networked play will opperate fine under vanilla or well-created missions on a beefy server, but adding in a lot of players and custom scripts will quickly lead to major, annoying dsync.   The creative freedom in this game also means that expecting to launch the game, join any open server, and bunker down for some fun isn't a realistic expectation. A vast majority of the servers are community operated, meaning there are some very good and very poor servers. Apart from the diversity in game modes (a positive element), many of the same game modes (or missions) are modified by their respective server owners. This could mean some extra goodies, or some unexpectedly low FPS.  For all the negatives this game has, the positive elements will easily and repeated lead me to highly recommend this game. Just know what you're signing up for before purchasing ;)

6955	1	a	this is awsome and i recommend it to others
6957	1	a	Great Simulator IF you have Oculus Rift Recomend game Great
6959	1	a	Best shooter out there!  KOTH FOR WIN
6961	1	a	lotta fun with the right ppl
6963	1	a	But only with mods:P
6965	1	a	Ook this game is speachless ...get some friends team up and let the fun begin. ;)  If you decide to buy the game then try out some Sandbox (this happens to be my favorite type of game) and the best servers if you ask me are the ws.arma.su. One more thing to say is that this is not Call of Duty this is a game where you fight for everything you need and it will take you further then COD will ever do. PS : This game is not for kids !!!
6967	1	a	This game will stand the test of time.
6969	1	a	Very good game with horrible optimalization (may be caused by my laptop). I love this game even when I have low fps. Best part of this game begins, when you mod it!
6971	1	a	A good Military Simulation game that allows the player to experience different senarios. The game includes Multiplayer and Singleplayer, differenciating the types of experiences that you can face in the game. DIfferent gamemodes and custom servers also makes Arma 3 a fun game to play.
6973	1	a	I have played over 100+ hours and this is my favourite game off all time.  Like when i play Altis:  1) Go up to an ATM take out all your money 2) Go buy a car 3) Drive to the Gun Store (takes million year to drive) 4) Buy license and gun 5) Drive down to kaval again  6) get robbed 7) cops drive pass  8) loss you gun  10/10  Get this game
6975	1	a	plz give me this game i love this game
6977	1	a	Start playing arma Join invade and annex server play for 15 minues to capture zone Squad dies on defense pushed to edge of cliff under fire Try to jump off into water No jump button Die 10/10 Would fail to recreate lone survivor again 
6979	1	a	One of the best games out there ! With the amount of missions / mods out there.. the game will never end.  Alphas.se - Swedish Gaming Community  SERVER 1: Name: /\ | Alphas.se - HighFPS - PlayerSave  Mission: A3Wasteland Address: 79.136.43.131 Port: 2302  SERVER 2: Name: /\ | Alphas.se - Swedish Community - Domination  Mission: Domination GITS Address: 79.136.43.131 Port: 2314
6981	1	a	Without a doubt Arma 3 is worth all the money if not more. I've had my some of best memories in gaming playing this game. There's so much variety in the amount of things you can do. Get bored of Altis Life? Then hop on KoTH. End up being bored with that later too? Well don't worry because Arma is jam packed with tons of content and different game modes to suit your needs. Just to name off a few of the other awesome game modes there's Exile, Domination, Wasteland, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, RPG/Life, etc. And then there's also the in-game editor and scenerarios. Whenever someone asks me if they should buy Arma 3, I always tell them, 'A pc without Arma 3, is like a human without a soul.' Though I would suggest having a mid/high tier build if you're planning to get into Arma 3. It's pretty unoptimized on weaker machines.  Yes you should definetly buy Arma 3, even if you aren't into shooters I'm sure you can find some enjoyment with this game.
6983	1	a	Got pulled over going 300 in a 100 km/h zone got a warning. got pulled over going 115 in 100 km/h zone and got $1,500 fine. 10/10
6985	1	a	The gameplay says it all. Awesome!
6987	1	a	10/10 would waste 1000 hours again :D
6989	1	a	No matter if you are a modder, mapmaker with no advance tool knowledge, shooter, taker, air head, rts player, mission maker, or explorer; this game is for you.
6991	1	a	Very realistic and addictive, now give me my  community badge!  Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 badge!
6993	1	a	Best Military Simulator with plenty of mods and a huge RP community.
6995	1	a	This game will stand the test of time.

7003	1	a	Very nice game if u play coop
7005	1	a	So I got the Exile Mod installed and ran about 1 hour around Esseker looking for supplies. I see a guy around a hospital and he looks unarmed, just like me. I ran to him and we started talking. Soon after I was handcuffed and naked in the open. He sayed he'd comeback with something to free me. 'Well, this is all I've got' - he says. Gets executed.  11/10 would socialize in a harsh apocaliptic wasteland again
7007	1	a	Pass the  weed  PTSD
7009	1	a	Altough it does have some frame issues at times, it's a solid title with a unique multiplayer experience. Worth a buy imo!
7011	1	a	My favorite game it is so fun and 128h in game

7039	1	a	Really good Game
7041	1	a	this my first game in steam

7045	1	a	Arma 3 is one of the few games you can get for a few bucks (18â‚¬ summersale 2016 -without DLCs) and in wich you can spend months of playing and still have fun
7047	1	a	Laggy, buggy, de-sync. It has everyting that an Arma game needs. 10/10.
7049	1	a	I started playing this game today and when I first joined I knew I was gonna love the game 1st off if you like to Roleplay or maybe get into some hardcore PVP then this is the game for you. Why not hop down to the PD and sign up for a job to earn some money for you and your gang! Trust me this is definitely worth the money! Good luck to everyone! Hope this helped. Peace -Nathan
7051	1	a	About as close as you'll get to being in war without having to leave your home... 5.56/7.62 would recommend
7053	1	a	One of the best games for tactical teams, modder, kids and people how like roleplay.  Everything is possible in Arma 3
7055	1	a	50 hours of crawling though a forest only to get mowed down by a well placed machine gun
7057	1	a	If you like the smell of VDM and couple of baldies this is the game for you. :standingchicken:
7059	1	a	10/10 would spend hundreds of hours on game again
7061	1	a	Arma III is the best chopper crash test, LSD dragon catch simulator out there!!!! Watch out for druken pilots and soldier, everyone on arma is drunk or has take some drugs!!! And the level beginning   'Euhm I hope weÂ´re not gonna to die again... Me too Me too ... And we crashed again... Affirmative Shi t F a c k'  Well seriously this game is awesome, there are bugs, there are many bugs BUT this are funny as hell.  So if you got so often dissappointed by EA or Activision about their next 'big' title. You should buy this game!! At first I was like I donÂ´t know Arma I wonÂ´t buy it, and then there was a Steam sales and Arma 3 was free to play, and what should I say.... I got 19Hours play time since beginning, and just bought that game. And a big + is also the multiplayer community is that what it should have been in Battlefield, almost everyone is nice and you can work as a team together to get your objectiv.
7063	1	a	Best military simulation game out there. Great sandbox with incredible modability and community support. You will find no other game with the same amout of teamplay and immerssion. It suffers from bad performance, occassional bugs, silly physics and semi-acceptable DLC policy.  Strives when played with an organized group. With support of many advanced modifications it shows its full potential.
7065	1	a	Great Game

7075	1	a	You know why! Just get it...
7077	1	a	Played a bit, quite a learning curve.
7079	1	a	Best war simulator ever. Ran with my tank over a very tiny rock, did double backflip and exploded. Physics work on 110%. I can only recommend.
7081	1	a	If you have some interest in simulated military gameplay and some friends, go for it. Alternatively you can check out some of the great mods like Altis life, Battle royale or Exile.
7083	1	a	love this game so much
7085	1	a	very good open world shooter
7087	1	a	Best game and best update APEX
7089	1	a	After playing hours and hours of Arma i still think its a great game. The modding community really keeps it alive.

7107	1	a	Is nice even at 10fps
7109	1	a	80/100 
7111	1	a	Endless amount of fun. There are so so many different game modes. It's fun with friends or solo. The only thing you will have to worry about is the mentally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ COD kids on wasteland servers.
7113	1	a	Although performance, gameplay and graphics are still not the best, Arma 3 is one of the best strategic and realistic shooter on the market.  Its mod support and community offer a decent amount of game modes, scenarios and other cool stuff, giving you the oportunity to play not just a shooter, but also an amazing role play game, a depressing post apocalypse survival game, the most realistic military simulation so far and many other cool things brought to you by the community or Bohemia itself!  If you like strategic or realistic shooter Arma 3 is a must have! Just go sure and check the system requirements before buying... ;)
7115	1	a	I primarily play Altis Life, and where some servers have more rules then others, you can definitely feel like a true cop as you tase people for doing absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever. 10/10
7117	1	a	This is one of the best simulator games I've ever played. There is so much to do including a single player story mode, an editor, loads of mods, and a ton of multiplayer gamemodes. I highly reccomend playing this game.
7119	1	a	ALthough it falls short in many ways its still a blast to play
7121	1	a	Cons Needs a beast PC to run on highest settings. Slightly clunky.  Pro's It's the ultimate military sandbox. Backwards compatible with all legacy content, literally 1,000's of weapons, vehicles and other assets. A ton of beautiful and vast maps, new and legacy. Amazing editor, unlimited options in terms of gameplay. Amazing dedicated modding community, some incredible mods out there, backwards compatible with older mods. Great and varied communities, from fun 'Life' and Zombie clans to serious Milsim units. Continuously being tweaked and improved, regular and substantial official updates. Fair DLC policy, not buying DLC does not stop you from playing with those who do. Combined arms, air, land and sea. Jet pilot to scuba diver. Realistic ballistics modelling.  This is the one, if you have a PC that can run it and you're prepared to get used to the controls there is no limit to what is possible gameplay wise.   Mods include vehicles, weapons, maps, SP/MP missions, campaigns, Star Wars, WW2, 'Nam, realistic comms systems, realistic health management, enhanced avatar movement, uniforms, RTS UI etc etc...  If you like military gaming then you should consider buying Arma 3, to really appreciate how great this game can be join an active well run community, it's the best way to learn about the game and to get the most from it.  9/10 - here's a sweet showcase video that scratches the surface of what's possible in Arma 3.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzMBOmOweiE 
7123	1	a	Love this series since  Operation Flashpoint  (original not the other monster). Bohemia created something that I followed for years and it's longest franchise I'm attached to. Free and open, great action, harcore tactics, hard and yet I scream for more many emotions come to my mind. A3 is evolution of greatest A2 (which born Dayz mod) which I treasue most for so many great memories.  pros * open world * can be modded, greatest strenght of this game * provides tons of good fun which increase with mods * one of or not if greatest platform for network based playing (up to 64 players) * mods (hmmm, did I say this already?) * decent storylines (pretty short though) * war climax, not too many games relate to civilian aspects of conflicts * audio (specially after tweak) * graphics on cool PC's and servers  cons * scripted body animation * no jumping (after all these years they did not figure ot out!?) * AI in long run fails or is OP * not a fun of vehicle driving here
7125	1	a	Nothing out today touches this game. NOTHING. Been going hard since 144kbps DOOM 4-way, Quake1-Netquake, Quakeworld. Etc.. You get the point. This is the one and only that stands far out from the rest. Nothing comes even close. I am still awaiting for years the game that can come close. Nothing yet. Huge learning curve thats the only downside so dont be a lazy fk. Those who cant mustard it up have to hack the PBO's are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es so watchout for them hackers, they are few and far between due to guys who run and operate Breaking Point they are strict.
7127	1	a	Even after a 1000 hours of gameplay, I am still finding, enjoying and playing new things about this game. The sheer depth of what is available within the Arma community make a good game absolutely amazing. The number of different mods, game modes and excellent additions make this a very easy game to find something you will like. Be it pure combat with tanks and helicopters, roleplaying and life servers, a military simulation community using all the varieties of radios, weapons and uniforms, DayZ spin offs which have much fewer bugs than the standalone...  The list goes on and on.   I cut my teeth on the Alpha and Beta of Arma 3, and whilst it struggled at the beginning to make things work properly, and to provide a fun experience, it has developed into a wonderful addition to my library. So much so that after a couple of years, its my most played game. There is literally something for everyone here, and it is regularly on at half price. Buy it, love it, make the most of it.
7129	1	a	Hands down best game on steam.
7131	1	a	Fairly realistic military game, controls are hard to learn, many gamemodes to suit different people. There are servers ranging from mil-sim to DayZ type servers (Exile), to GTA style servers and King of the Hill games. The Apex expansion is very good, adding a new interesting, detailed map.  A3 Launcher can be used to easily install mods, but it does not work for some people.  It's reccommended to have a good group of friends to play with.
7133	1	a	This game can be cancerous at times, but its really fun when you run from cops on a go cart.
7135	1	a	Though with my few hours I can honestly say that this game is just amazing. It took me a bit to learn how to play but once you get over the learning curve the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing epic. There is a monumental scale of gamemodes all made by the community. I personally enjoy Wasteland a survival situation in which players are thrown onto a random location on the map and are forced to find gear to survive. Others include King of the Hill which is a major action packed gamemode where all gun fire is focused on one city. It's hectic. Though the price is a bit high you might think. The game is well worth the money for how much fun you will have.
7137	1	a	Buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ homie, amazing game bruh
7139	1	a	This game is frustrating, it's dowright infuriating at times.  And I absolutely love it.  Oh, it has a steep learning curve. It's a big hill to climb before you learn all the controls, then get used to the somewhat bizarre controls (especially if you're coming at it from other FPS's). And the pace is very different from your CoDs and Battlefields and whatnot.  But this isn't trying to be those games. It is not a shooter, it's a simulation. And it's the best one there is.  - It's a true sandbox game. From the campaign to the multiplayer. And there's nothing like it out there.   - The standard map, Altis, is a replica of the real-world island of Lemnos. And me and my mates love it so much, we're saving up to go there on holiday.  - You can do whatever you please. The scouting missions in singleplayer let you explore the map and do missions, the multiplayer opens up the entire map and lets you do whatever.  - Bohemia are absolute darlings and are doing a fantastic job. Have been for years. The community is beautiful, from the players to the modders.   Oh, and one of the devs got arrested for 'espionage' while visiting the island for research. That's how committed these people are.   TL;DR:  Joined a squad as a medic. Saved about 12 people, then got shot... a squadmate carried me on his back a full kilometre to get revived by another medic.  11/10, would get shot again.
7141	1	a	For Â£44. I've expected more, But the workshop items make up for it.
7143	1	a	Played most of my hours in Arma 3 Battle Royale and it has been an absolute blast. Took some time getting the fps stable enough, but that I can live with:) Tactical, adrealin pumping and realistic combat simulator!  
7145	1	a	Trust Bohemia they are engineer.
7147	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played
7149	1	a	what can i say ? this game has endless things to do i highly would suggest this game.
7151	1	a	Very good game, a lot to do on here. Worth a buy:D
7153	1	a	ArmA 3 is a sandbox military game, which excels in a number of ways. The way the game encourages community-play and user modification is unprecedented. I'll briefly summarize a couple pros and cons.  PROS:   Infinitely customizable. With the in-built editor and SQF scripting language, you can make any scenario you can think of.   Thriving modding community. With small mods that change minor gameplay aspects to complete overhauls like CUP and RHS, there is an incredible amount of community built content for you to enjoy.   Variety of scenarios. If you want to be a lone wolf in a zombie apocolypse, or just a standard rifleman in a huge coordinated operation, there are scenarios and groups for you.   CONS:   Almost requires DLC. You can play the game purely vanilla, but most servers and communites you find will require at least Apex, if not everything else.   Steep learning curve. Being a game with incredible movement controls, these controls all require keybinds that need to be learned, on top of potentially learning to fly planes and helicopters, this could take a while.   In summary, Arma 3 can cost a bit and take a large amount of hard drive space, but is extremely rewarding to learn and find a group of people to play with.
7155	1	a	realistic military shooter filled with special children 10/10 i love driving an suv into a chinese military base and dying
7157	1	a	This game contains so much because of the mods     it's awesome
7159	1	a	Best open world war simulator and installing mods brings a whole new game for you to play
7161	1	a	Awesome game! The best you can get in Mil-Sim! Recommend high powered CP though. Takes a good graphics card.
7163	1	a	I hate this game so much, and I love it in the same time. :)

7171	1	a	With this game and it's great (modding) community only the sky is the limit. This is truly a 'Be all you want to be' game.
7173	1	a	Nice game
7175	1	a	I play this game a lot and after all this time I still do. I will also probably never stop
7177	1	a	Olympus Sucks
7179	1	a	The. Best. Game. Ever.     *Drops mic*
7181	1	a	Best game ever! Amazing for roleplay
7183	1	a	With proper mods and good community, this is the only war game you need.
7185	1	a	A great open world, military simulator that allows players to go and create their own content, game modes, and missions. It is good, possibly even better that is has been the day it came out. With the APEX DLC released, it was made Arma 3 almost a whole new game, with a new map, vehicles, weapons, and characters.
7187	1	a	Best game for realism shooters! Not even compared to Battlefield. I loved playing the campaign and I love playing multiplayer! Just joined to a milsim unit and every week I do at least 3 drills.
7189	1	a	This game made me â™¥â™¥â™¥ 5 times in 5 MINUTES!   No Sign Up No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t No Download   Download NOW for FREE HD PORN Game!  *terribly animated porno GIF here*
7191	1	a	ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GAMES YOUR EVER PLAY no lie you wont regret this purchase hmu if you wanna play sometimes
7193	1	a	Great game, it doesn't matter if you want to shoot a gun, fly a jet or drop troops off in a helo. You can dowhatever you want in this game. There are even mods to go fishing...imagine that!  I will update this when I have the time, I have to play some more. Gotta get up to 2000 hours to meet target set by other players.
7195	1	a	Drove a car at 65 mph straight into a tree, car blew up and the tree survived.  10/10
7197	1	a	Great game, but heavy for many PC!
7199	1	a	great game, what more. Just need a decebt pc
7201	1	a	ARMA III's graphics are amazing, the community made missions are awesome, and the maps currently in the game are very pretty. There isn't much to the vanilla singleplayer, they are currently developing the campaign and have only released one 'episode' of it so far, but there are plenty of brilliant singleplayer and multiplayer missions available on the Steam Workshop. They developers have done a great job at making this as realistic and immersive as possible. Rating: 10 slithering snakes out of 10.  Update: 11/25/2016 Above and beyond what could have been expected from any developer working on a military sim like this with continued plans for future content release.
7203	1	a	Gr8 2 play m8.  Buy dis ples
7205	1	a	One of the best realism simulators out there. Workshop content makes hours of fun with friends as well as helps the more advanced servers you can find out there.
7207	1	a	its a fun game but you need a good pc to play it. the fun you can have depends on what you like but in the end its all about the gunplay. unless you lioke the rp mods as there are a lot of them out there
7209	1	a	By far one of the best game's of all time. It is not only just a milsim but a platform for hundreds of other different game types. such as the life mod or king of the hill. I would deffinently reccomend this game to anyone who has a resonable PC. I could play this game forever as the community and bohemia are actively working on new game types mods etc to provide a deeper expansion of the game.
7211	1	a	Good game with friends, very moddable, if you like a game with variying pace this is for you.
7213	1	a	This game is best enjoyed with some mods that add extra realism on top of the game already being quite realistic. It is by far one of the best Army simulators out there and will remain so for a while.
7215	1	a	An amazing game! Millitary sandbox with many game modes. Milsim, Roleplaying, TDM and Capture the Hill. This game is for everyone!
7217	1	a	One of the best games i ever played,so many mods,missions..every pearson can find somethink in arma that can enjoy
7219	1	a	This game is amazing especially if you like to do some rp then just buy the game.
7221	1	a	One of the best games i ever played,so many mods,missions..every pearson can find somethink in arma that can enjoy
7223	1	a	This game is amazing especially if you like to do some rp then just buy the game.
7225	1	a	You can almost do everything! But the most inportat is... YOU CAN KILL RABBITS!!!  Just get this game. its awesome!    10/10 
7227	1	a	  This game is fun to play but it has steep learning curve. And some may say dlc are must and that's somewhat the case but personally I don't regret buying any of them.
7229	1	a	Great game when you have alot of time to put into it, would defenilty recommend it if you like tactical games.
7231	1	a	10/10 with with nice mods
7233	1	a	i think this game should win because it never gets old.
7235	1	a	Arma 3 is a love hate relationship. Once you figure out the basic controls for each type of system its a blast. The most recent DLC APEX is amazing and just feels really refined. If you dont like twitch shooters and you like to think about your move before you make it. This is the game for you!
7237	1	a	This is a must-have game for everyone that is interested in modern war and such.
7239	1	a	  This game is quite good should buy if u have the money and love war/military stuff
7241	1	a	Another case of 'download mods for several days then play for several hours, repeat'
7243	1	a	Good game with friends, very moddable, if you like a game with variying pace this is for you.
7245	1	a	This is The best Realistic military game u ever can get! it got so damn much!!! And it is so fun to play with friends, dont matter what game style u have, u can play in a clan Or u can play with friends and just bombing towns! :D
7247	1	a	it's a pretty good game if you enjoy playing with pizza faced nerds and danny devito. i, on the otherhand, prefer to play the more tactical 'Simcity 2000'. it's a real game for real gamers like me and not a casual like you.
7249	1	a	Simply the best game ever - Only with mods. Without mods, it is still a great game.
7251	1	a	Once you taste ARMA 3, there's no going back to games like Battlefield and Call of duty.   You have ascended the stairs to adulthood.
7253	1	a	Arma 3 seems like a good game, unfortunately it is proving to be nearly impossible to play any missions with just two people. I have the APEX edition and I see the features like the class creator, then when I get into the game I realize that there is no way for me to actually be able to use the custom classes I create in game! Which is incredibly frustrating. 'Oh you want to play a mission that would be perfect for sniping? Well we will make sure that you can only use an assualt rifle and an ACOG in EVERY MISSION!' That is the unfortunate message that I am getting from the game. If ANYONE CAN HELP please do so. I think it could be a very enjoyable game IF it had some simple features such as the ability to actually play the way you want to play.   Thanks
7255	1	a	I dont know what to think about this game didnt play it much but meh i kinda like it.
7257	1	a	its vry relistic and kewl
7259	1	a	Very cool game. Lots of MODs.
7261	1	a	As much as I wish that BI would add more modern weapons, I know they added the AR-15 platform to the game with the Apex DLC and there are mods but this game is pretty damn good, even without them.
7263	1	a	Amazing game, but its not for everyone.  :)
7265	1	a	You wont get bored of this game. There's just too much to do. You need a fairly decent PC to play some of the large multiplayer servers but it's no big deal. I've had a blast on this game and I plan to for a long time. Recommend this to anyone looking for lots of fun and some very weird and unique people. Roleplay, Battle Royale [Hunger Games], Wasteland &amp; King Of The Hill are just some of the amazing game modes.   That's all.
7267	1	a	This is a great game with tons of mods to keep u going forever. Some people complain about the DLC and it being to pricy but this game is like BF,COD,GTA,H1Z1,DayZ,RTS combined and if u put those titles alone together wich will give u less play hours ull be spending allot more money on those even if u bought the entire Arma 3 collection at full price.  Totally worth the money. And if its on sale. 100% must buy.
7269	1	a	A game that teaches you what working as a team and communication means.5/5
7271	1	a	If you don't already own this game I'm disapointed.. It's a pretty awsome game with various stuff to do, check it out!!!
7273	1	a	Awesome game, only requires a good pc.
7275	1	a	Never actually really got to play the game :/ 2.6 hours of trying to load it xDDDDDDD
7277	1	a	Honestly, the only problems with this game is that the game is horribly optimized and has very little content in the base game, don't get me wrong, there's lots of stuff to do and this game is the definition of replayability but there's simply not that many vehicles and you'll find yourself using the same guns over and over again. However you can always mod the game but for someone who don't wan't to do that, well then, you're out of luck, there's just not much to play with in the base. I personaly mod the game so I don't have this problem but I didn't before and to honest, the base version is very 'meh'. But all in all, this game is as solid as any and for a cheaper price than COD or BF you are going to have a lot more fun, even without mods.
7279	1	a	some how i have this game?
7281	1	a	  Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!
7283	1	a	:)
7285	1	a	Do you like dying a lot?   Arma 3!   Do you like military stuff?   Arma 3!   Do you like to slaughter rabbits?   Arma 3!  Do you like to pilot planes?   Arma 3!   Do you like to watch the sunset?   Arma 3!   You don't like doing any of this? Buy Arma 3 anyway cause it's one of the best sandbox game out there!

7289	1	a	This game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game. You are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missions/mods you will never get bored.
7291	1	a	Best Military Third/Fps game ever,,,, Ground breaking graphics makes war even real ,, tactics and planning every step you take is awesome ,,, Great war atmosphere ,, Unlike Cod/Battlefield You have to be aware in Every step you take Cuz You can be shot 400 miter away . Best Simulation Game Ever. XD
7293	1	a	Played a bunch of Arma 2 when it came out, finally got the money for this and i love it
7295	1	a	wish i could play. every time i try to load the game it gets stuck on loading profile options it's annoying
7297	1	a	Good game needs some performace working thou
7299	1	a	When you're not getting killed by a door or suffering from 10 FPS on your Â£3000 Ultra-Advanced Gaming PC, this game offers a lot of fun through semi-realistic combat and a wide range of game modes.   Multiplayer is what makes the game. Offline game modes are mainly used for practice as the campaign is pretty basic in story and character detail. However, it's hard to get bored of everything that multiplayer has to offer; Altis Life RPG, Wasteland, Exile, Invade &amp; Annex, you name it.   The gameplay mechanics are the worst part of the game. You really can die by opening a bloody door, albeit rare. Not to mention the driving physics. It can be very tough to drive using just W, A, S and D. Even crashing into a rock that appears as though it just 'Came outta nowhere!' at 5MPH can do severe damage to your car and health. The game's packed with glitches.   Aside from the occasional buggy annoyance, if you're looking for a war simulator that allows a range of unique experiences, ARMA 3 is probably your best bet.
7301	1	a	One of the best games out there ! With the amount of missions / mods out there.. the game will never end.  Alphas.se - Swedish Gaming Community  SERVER 1: Name: /\ | Alphas.se - HighFPS - PlayerSave  Mission: A3Wasteland Address: 79.136.43.131 Port: 2302  SERVER 2: Name: /\ | Alphas.se - Swedish Community - Domination  Mission: Domination GITS Address: 79.136.43.131 Port: 2314
7303	1	a	Without a doubt Arma 3 is worth all the money if not more. I've had my some of best memories in gaming playing this game. There's so much variety in the amount of things you can do. Get bored of Altis Life? Then hop on KoTH. End up being bored with that later too? Well don't worry because Arma is jam packed with tons of content and different game modes to suit your needs. Just to name off a few of the other awesome game modes there's Exile, Domination, Wasteland, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, RPG/Life, etc. And then there's also the in-game editor and scenerarios. Whenever someone asks me if they should buy Arma 3, I always tell them, 'A pc without Arma 3, is like a human without a soul.' Though I would suggest having a mid/high tier build if you're planning to get into Arma 3. It's pretty unoptimized on weaker machines.  Yes you should definetly buy Arma 3, even if you aren't into shooters I'm sure you can find some enjoyment with this game.
7305	1	a	It's ok i guess.
7307	1	a	I do recommend this game, but there is something that you need to know about this game.... This game is not the most optimized game out there, your PC might struggle like hell. You can enjoy this game if your PC specs meet the requirement, even so you might face FPS drop during gameplay (explosion, etc.). This game is CPU intensive, if you experience FPS drop, there's a chance it is caused by your CPU (unless you set the graphics all the way to high then your GPU might be the case too).  This is a military simulation game, if you like games like Call of Duty (and used to it), you might not like this game however if you want to try something new then this game is worth a shot. This game has limited HUD, there is no minimap and if somebody is shooting, you will not be given a hint and you will need to find the source yourself. You will be given a compass to help you to locate yourself, and to give other people hints about the location of the enemy. Every single bullet counts, I mean 1-3 shots can kill somebody, do not spray and pray. You will not be given a hint about your location, so you need to be observant and check your surrounding.  One big problem about this game is.... There is no melee so you can't kill other players with a knife, it can be a huge turn off for some people (I am one of those people), nevertheless it is less likely that you will use melee in the game, it is most likely a gunfight.  If you want a shooter game and want to spice things up then Arma 3 could be the game for you, if you are still unsure then you can check some YouTube videos and see it for yourself. This game is hard, the control buttons are many (I highly recommend newcomers to go to the tutorial first) before going into the campaign or multiplayer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My PC specs can be seen in my profile, just to let you know how well this game run at least in this setup. I can play this game in Ultra settings.
7309	1	a	With +900 hours of game time..   It is a game worth having. If you are new to the Arma series, or just Arma 3 in paticular, it is a worth while experience.  With all the mods, different game types, and friends made while playing, it's a game I dont regret buying.
7311	1	a	Start playing arma Join invade and annex server play for 15 minues to capture zone Squad dies on defense pushed to edge of cliff under fire Try to jump off into water No jump button Die 10/10 Would fail to recreate lone survivor again 
7313	1	a	Awesome game, only requires a good pc.
7315	1	a	Played a little, has some replayability.
7317	1	a	I really like Arma But Since they keep updating and the other game franchies are giving their DLC's for free. pretty much I think that they should eventually give the Apex out for people or at least make the Other DLc's such as Marksman, Karts, Helicopters free because the market on their prices on Apex is more then 20 bucks in my eyes. I think that it would be kinda awesome to see that the DLC's should come out free for owners that have had Arma 3 before there biggest update. If not then I would say that reduce the prices on the Steam Store. Sure the sales are nice, But it only goes down lower to 20 bucks, Which its way expensive for its DLC. Plus Since their Marksman, Helicopter and Karts. They should be free by now because Apex is pretty much the biggest DLC and most expensive. 30$ Bucks.
7319	1	a	Least kids ive seen in an online game ever.
7321	1	a	some how i have this game?
7323	1	a	  Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!
7325	1	a	Played a bunch of Arma 2 when it came out, finally got the money for this and i love it
7327	1	a	Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Military Simulator out there. Only problem, terribly optimized game. SP Can run extremely well, but MP will destroy your frames. Get a decent PC before playing this. 
7329	1	a	You're either going to tear your hair out, or be hooked in the first half hour.
7331	1	a	it's a great game but it takes a beefy pc to run it somewhat smoothly, if I was to buy it again I would wait until the framerate issues get better than their current state.
7333	1	a	The PC Experience 10/10 
7335	1	a	A great millitary sim. It really demands the use of team work and strategy
7337	1	a	Great game
7339	1	a	You like being a soldier?  You enjoy playing in a clan? You want almost full Realism?  50 - 200m are close quarters for you? Get this Masterpiece!  (Except if youre an Altis Life, Wasteland, Exile etc. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, go suck a keyboard)

7343	1	a	A game where you can do anything except having more than 30 FPS... AND jumping.
7345	1	a	I wanted to play a game were i could snipe but realisticly, most people told me to play battlefield 4 or battlefield 1 but tbh it wasnt good enough so i went and asked a couple friends and they said arma 3 and ive only been playing it for 23.6 hours but i feel like ive played so much already like in KOTH( King of the Hill) i already have enough money to buy a sniper plus a scope, im looking forward to shooting some people in the face.     BloodThirst, out
7347	1	a	I wish I did not bought this game so I could buy it again - 10/10
7349	1	a	The best words to describe this game are incredible. I've played Arma 3 for quite a while now, a total of about 1410 hours now, and it is definetly one of the best games that I've ever played, if not the best.  Like shooters? Arma 3  Like Roleplay? Arma 3  Like Strategy? Arma 3  Like MilSims? Arma 3  This game offers it all!!
7351	1	a	As always, this still is the best military simulator in the world! ArmA keeps affascinating me for its realism. I really suggest you to buy the game if you're a 'fan of war', real war. The maps are really detailed and the AI is really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Actually, too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem. Anyway, if you buy this game, PLAY IT WITH A CLAN. Arma 3 really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission. if you're a CoD fan, you rather change side or forget about ArmA. They are completely different, and ArmA itself is usually not liked by 'shoot and run' fan boys. However, ArmA's editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail. Actually, it's not too simple making them, but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends. Furthermore, there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands, suggestions, and scripts. ENJOY.
7353	1	a	Played a couple of hours... It was alright, I guess.
7355	1	a	Operating operators operating operationally meets special needs children walking with their asscheeks.
7357	1	a	it crashes more often than Paul Walker but except from that its okay  see you again/10
7359	1	a	Great game, still trying to figure out some things about the game tho XD but great game
7361	1	a	est game ever I recomend geting while its on sale :D
7363	1	a	Simply the best close to realistic shooter you are going to play. So many different mods that are great and frustrating but brilliant. So many hours wasted, I mean used, playing zombie type mods and KOH. Love it! :D
7365	1	a	Would this work on a mac
7367	1	a	It was ok I guess..
7369	1	a	you know, i was originally on the fence about how i felt about games like arma i never really cared for them outside of using them to play dayz holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ what a waste of time it was to use them for that and that only only recently have i begun playing more arma and less dayz  then i wanted arma 3, almost bought it for full price, got it for 40 bucks the next day AND got the rest of the expansions for arma 2 these are actually really fun games 
7371	1	a	Fantastic game. This has come on leaps and bounds form Arma 2.   Beautiful graphics, challenging combat, and a good variety of missions in the campaign.
7373	1	a	idk what im doing 13/10

7385	1	a	it's a very extensive game with amazing gameplay and teamplay, however i would like to see a more AAA type game within it, like a cinematic campaign with the first mision being a stealth escape froma camp MGS style, and then as you go you unlock more equipment, guns, vests and uniforms anything really. this would be an awesome feature within this amazing original game.
7387	1	a	est game ever I recomend geting while its on sale :D

7391	1	a	Do not get this game if you wish to have a normal life.  10/10 would waste life again.
7393	1	a	if u have an amazingly good processor and graphics card this game is for u
7395	1	a	This game is a dream come true for me! This is probably the most realistic combat simulator I have ever played! Being able to play on real, photo accurate locations is really fun, and awesome, especially when you take the vast size of the maps into consideration! My favorite part of this game are the 2D and 3D editor tools that are provided with the game, it allows you to create just about any scenario you can think of! Have you ever wanted to experience a stealth night operation as a scuba diver, and wipe out patrols? Or have you ever wanted to experience a full on war with combined operations, such as hundreds of ground units, armored vehicles, and aircraft? OR have you ever wanted to design a fortress that you and your AI team has to defend from hundreds of invading enemies? Well, all of this and much MUCH more is possible with the easy to use editor tools!  Also, I have come to the conclusion that Arma 3's AI is the most advanced, versitile, and smartest AI than any other game has to offer, I was extremely surprised when I hand-placed a bunch of jets in an airbase, to see the AI know how to actually taxi the jets to the runway strip, and take off in an orderly fashion without running into each other or other obstacles during the whole process!! Also, I didn't even place any waypoints or create any scripts for them, it was all the AI!!! The AI can adapt to pretty much any situation, and will follow orders from you if you are the leader of the group. Plus, it is really fun to watch independent AI squads battle it out without your interactions, the AI squad leaders will actually command their units (even you if you are part of their squad!) in any situation!  The multiplayer is very fun, you can play in a variety of servers that could involve capturing territories, fighting AI, role playing, combined operations with over a hundreds of players, or all of the above combined!!  Lastly, this is more of a thank you towards Bohemia Interactive: As someone who strongly supports the United States Military, and has 3 brothers in the Army, I thank you for your bold, brave, and admirable move, to not include female soldiers in this game, I understand that society is trying to move in that 'accepting', 'politically correct', and 'equality' direction, but this whole movement is proving to be VERY troublesome and problematic for the United States Military. Ask any American male soldier who has actually fought in combat overseas, what they think of allowing female soldiers fight by their sides, they will ALL say that it is not good, and that they rather keep females off the battlefields. Unfortunately, American society doesn't understand the fact that females naturally do not have the capability of controlling their emotions under stressful and dangerous situations as well as males can. There have been MANY recorded events that involve female soldiers putting their battle partners in grave danger during combat situations due to letting their emotions control them. I understand that this is just a video game, but it still does matter A LOT what developers do with their games, because you would be really surprised how many young men and women go to enlist for the military just because of movies or video games, honestly, it is really quite sad.  So thank you Bohemia Interactive, for making such a good game, you guys are making excellent bold moves, which I believe sets a great example of how other developers should operate, and not fall into the common traps set by society. Thank you!  James Glenn
7397	1	a	Great Simulator IF you have Oculus Rift Recomend game Great
7399	1	a	Very cool game. Lots of MODs.
7401	1	a	Probably the best shooter out there. Loads of things are possible within the game. A lot of gamemodes, for example roleplay games.
7403	1	a	If it's military realism you're looking for, look no further. With a modding scene that adds everything from Star Wars and Mechs, to the entire US Army vehicle and weapons sets, ARMA 3 is an absolute playground for those wanting to experience everything and anything to do with weapons, military vehicles and more.  If you can imagine it, there's a strong chance you can do it in ARMA 3. Constant updates increase the value and rich experience of the game, and new DLC bring further incredible assets to play around with. Highly recommended!
7405	1	a	14/10
7407	1	a	Its 10/10 to be honest. I rate it.   10/10 should download
7409	1	a	Arma 3 owns my life, no matter how mad I get at it sometimes, I'll always love it regardless. There is a endless amount of content due to mods that make this game even more amazing. It doesn't matter if your hardcore singleplayer like me or if hardcore multiplayer, there are gamemodes and scenarios for everyone. If you survival there's a server for that, if you love zombies there's a server for that, if you love realistic combat scenarios there's a server for that, if you love roleplay there's a server for that. If you're looking for a shooter that gives you a challenge but sometimes you like a break, Arma 3 is your game, I've played it for a little over 500 hours in about 2 years and I've enjoyed every second. All the death, the heart attacks when someone nearly shoots my head, and to all the people I've shot, I love all of it. The one thing however that bothers me the most is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing DLC, but it's such a minor thing, but when you do actually go to pick up a certain weapon and it tells you that you can't because you require a certain DLC, it will make you want to blow your brains out. But even the DLC, Arma 3 will stay my favorite shooter for a very long time
7411	1	a	I do like this game, although it is hard for some computers to handle it is fun. I like it becuase of the Exile mod which is a survival mod, i love survival games so it fits right. I suggest this game to others try it out I bet you'll like it.
7413	1	a	Try to be best â€˜Cause you're only a man And a man's gotta learn to take it Try to believe Though the going gets rough That you gotta hang tough to make it History repeats itself Try and you'll succeed Never doubt that you're the one And you can have your dreams!

7415	1	a	A very good game. Way better than Call of Duty and Battlefield.
7417	1	a	This is maybe the best war simulator out there you should try it though the multiplayer requires a lot of DLC but it is worth its money when you 'can' get into a server its fun as hell and the campagin THE BEST THING EVER, anyway this is what I think arma 3 is like and I think you should get it I would recommend this too my friends and everyone.
7419	1	a	Get this if you are looking for the biggest bang for your buck!
7421	1	a	had a cheat on dayz 3 years ago didnt realise i was on this account while buying arma 3 3/3 would buy agian
7423	1	a	a huge game in itself with like 200 other games inside of it and the scariest and most realistic sounds / gameplay  
7425	1	a	Its like skyrim but in the future 10/10 -IGN
7427	1	a	idk what im doing 13/10
7429	1	a	I liked the part when I got shot.
7431	1	a	the most realistic war game ever
7433	1	a	The best words to describe this game are incredible.

7435	1	a	it crashes more often than Paul Walker but except from that its okay  see you again/10
7437	1	a	I have missed many life events because of this game.......not even mad
7439	1	a	A cheaper and longer lasting GF replacement.
7441	1	a	30 out of 30 fps
7443	1	a	I really enjoy this game, i will admit tho it is alot better with mods installed
7445	1	a	Looks like a great game and I have really enjoyed the previous incarnations (still playing ARMA2 Operation Arrowhead) although htere seems to be hardly any scenarios in this version. Certainly I think I prefer the desert scenarios in OA. I would be hard pressed to point out anything major that this game does over OA really. The underwater environment was nothing to write home about really. The people look a little bit better and the sun is better etc but its nothing major. At the moment until more expansions are produced that add more scenarios etc I would recommend getting ARMA2 Combined Operations but this game will be great when filled out a little more.
7447	1	a	if you like tactical , military or stategy games, purchase it you damn â™¥â™¥â™¥!!! The only thing that i didnt like it , was that the servers sometimes are scrap ;p
7449	1	a	Best game I've ever had, imagine Garry's Mod and Battlefield had a baby, but the Battlefield part was actually good, framerate feels high yet its about 15-30, has more custom content than overwatch banned steam accounts, has scripts to make literal infinite amounts of custom scenarios to play with and HUGE amounts of mods that can either add small things or completely change how the game functions.  Total Hours says it all, buy the f****** thing!  1/10 did not pay for a good rating -IGN
7451	1	a	The most fun you can have with your clothes on.
7453	1	a	Best war simulator ever made specially in infantry , there are lots of war simulator games like squads , operation flashpoint series and many others but arma 3 is something else ... !   If you want to learn and get some real war experience buy this game ,  But if you are looking for a simple shooting game that you carry a gun and keep shooting enemies just like battlefield , call of duty , cs go and ... , I suggest you to do not buy this game otherwise this game going to be a boring game for you .   Great graphic quality , nice game control , AI's have great artificial intelligence witch you can set Difficulty for them and co-op is awesome , also PVP is great and campaign is good for learning .
7455	1	a	What arma is for newbies: A awkward horribly optimized stupidly clumsy military shooter.  What arma is for veterans: A awkward horribly optimized stupidly clumsy military shooter.  Never change arma.  
7457	1	a	It's the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7459	1	a	Absolutely worth the 20 or less FPS I got for an entire year until I upgraded my PC. Game is well worth the price even if you run on a toaster; gameplay is beyond fun if you play with a high amount of mods, or just modded servers in general. Pretty much unlimited amounts of things you can do.
7461	1	a	ive heard great things about this game too bad i cant afford the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :(
7463	1	a	Get it. Buy it. Play it.  You can literally do anything you want. Use your imagination folks! Best game for an FPS, by far.
7465	1	a	Graphically stunning  Community content either PVE or PVP extremely diverse and many mods offer extremely rewarding experiences.  90% of any good multiplayer experience in ARMA is found through good communication either relaying enemy positions or chatting and making friends with other players.   Have a Mic and know how to use it responsibly. Be mature in the way you communicate and you will make friends and have a good time.  game is regulalry on sale for 50% however is worth every $ of its regular price.
7467	1	a	THIS IS A COMBAT SIMULATOR, NOT AN FPS! I cannot stress that enough. Having said that some of my most memorable gaming moments came from this game. I can remember moving through a town, we were so close to the objective, then an explosion. A guy in my squad had stepped on a mine, then came another, and one more after. The enemy opened fire and we had to dive for cover. My squad quickly attempted to return fire but it seemed we were pinned, and there were three of my buddies still laying wouded in the open. Unsure of their condition I charged forward grabbing the first guy and pulling him behind cover, then the second and soon after the third. Miraculously I wasn't hit by gunfire, but we had problem, our medic was one of the three wounded. Without a field medic to stabilize the wounded they would surely die. I called out over the comms for anyone who could help, there was a long pause...then a response, a pilot just happened to be dropping off a squad nearby and was happy to evac them to HQ. We eventually managed to drive the enemy off, allowing for medevac to pick up the wounded and fly them to safety.    It still sounds to me like something that would be scripted in a singleplayer campaign, something where you are surrounded by npcs and you are merely along for the ride, just for entertainment. The truth is, these were all real players, fighting as a team, trying to save three members of their squad. It's player interactions like that that make this game incredible.  TLDR: This game is awesome, I cannot reccomend it enough!
7469	1	a	A cheaper and longer lasting GF replacement.
7471	1	a	30 out of 30 fps
7473	1	a	love this game there is never a time where i dont know what to do
7475	1	a	Indeed one of the best military simulators yet. So much to do you would never get bored.  63/64 cancer pasients would survive cancer after playing Arma 3.
7477	1	a	Arma is life
7479	1	a	Sure, there are better plane simulators, car simulators, and other kinds of simulators, but Arma 3 is the only game that can bring all of these simulators together, and make it a full, complete, military simulator. with tons of vehicles, from civilian cars and helicopters to military tanks and jets, where even the mirrors work while you're inside of them. There are also lots of gamemodes to choose from and mods to download and play.
7481	1	a	Very fun game, but very steep learning curve.
7483	1	a	10/10

7487	1	a	Just get it, seriously.
7489	1	a	great game but not as good as arma 2
7491	1	a	Only played for awhile but its pretty fun. 
7493	1	a	Arma 3 is a fun and complex military simulator that is not only as an awesome game on it's own, but serves as a platform for many awesome game modifications - my favorite being Exhile mod. While it has a strange and less-than-functional physics and animations systems, a moderate range of bugs (in multiplayer); and performance issues on AMD processors... - it still is great game well worth the price of entry.  Also, 64-bit executable coming soon!
7495	1	a	I hate reviews so this is going to be extremely short, but this game deserves a good one more than anything else.  I can not reccomend this game more highly, or reccomend any other game more than it.   It provides you with the most realistic, and highest quality military elements in the video game industry and allows you to do anything you want with them.  Infinity/10
7497	1	a	Im-...Im actually really stuck for words. My computer isn't even a gaming laptop and I can still play Arma 3 with my mates. This game makes me feel mixed emotions of-... OF JOY! This game is so awesome and the detail put in OMG, the game is a BIG part of my life now. I actually feel as if I am part of the army, thank you for allowing this game to be made. Its. So . GOOD!
7499	1	a	i got this game on sale but i would of happly paid full price for it, amazing game so many different servers to play on. if your looking for a call of duty type of game this isnt it
7501	1	a	Worth every penny, best game for graphic designs, but fps can be pretty frightening and is hard to gain fps. AFTER all that's the engine it's using. Would recommend to all gamers!
7503	1	a	Fun and intense as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. This realistic shooter will have you on the edge of your seat in the compaign and in multiplayer (which is hype AS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥). The RP server are pretty cool too, its always a plus to have functional RP servers in games.
7505	1	a	arma 3 is the best war simulation game . i am recommend you to play this game
7507	1	a	Amazing but not a good variety of vehicles. It will deserve the wait though. Love the soundtrack.
7509	1	a	Good war simulator. Has some glitches.
7511	1	a	ArmA 3 is a must have for any shooter fan that enjoys open-ended possibilities. With several mods now available (hence the reason I'm changing my review) there are just so many things that you can do it's not even funny. Co-op missions are fun, getting with a larger group and doing an MCC or Zeus mission is just ridiculously fun, and the campaign is still solid.  If you prefer PvP, there are a lot more modes out now than when I originally wrote the review. King of The Hill is the only one I've really played and it's not really my jam, but hey, if it is yours then go for it.   The game is fairly well optimized at this point, but really poorly optimized MP servers are extremely noticable and when bad scripting is done, it's even more noticable. This game on an SSD is a pretty intelligent decision.  With or without mods, there is just a ton that you can do with this game. If you're at all into large scale operations or even long-lasting missions on a smaller scale, you NEED this game. Point blank.
7513	1	a	ARMA. The most respected Mil-Sim series to date. Serious play, that's the objective.  'Fun' isn't a word I would use. It's not casual, you simply can't hop in, play 15 minutes, and then hop out. The enjoyment comes from finding a server and getting to know people. Playing with them when you take on hour long missions, that's the enjoyment.  First thing I have to say really, which I almost forgot about, IT'S REAL SCALE. The 'maps' really should be called environments. You can't drive from one side of the island to another in minutes. The battlefield is really a battlefield. While most modern games focus on a small segment of a city, town or something, ARMA is about the openess making you sniper bait. You have to look hard for hostiles, they could be shooting at you from a hill across the valley.  Performance. Was it terrible the first few days after release. Even still, AI seem to cause a drop in FPS even though they are far away. This isn't latency, this is pure frame for frame output. Never really understood how something unoptimized got pushed out. That being said, they follow Valve's ideas and push out updates for free.  I play with a GTX 560Ti and Core i7 870. CPU matters, GPU matters. i3 wasn't up for the task, even with a 4GHz clock. You need an i7 or 8-core AMD heat monster to play with details. If you can push your rig, you get to see things that many don't get to see.  N00bs will have a large hill to climb in regards to learning the game.  7/10
7515	1	a	It was the only game i played till i had 140hrs on it. O.o
7517	1	a	If you like playing games you'll like playing this game.
7519	1	a	Damn good game. So many mods, so little time.
7521	1	a	a 12 yr old raged at me for taking his pilot seat in an attack helicopter, i then proceeded to takeoff and lag into the ground, teamkilling 6 guys, got banned from server.  420/69 would lag/steal again   p.s. i have an i7 4820k, gtx 780, 16gb ram, 240gb ssd.....pull 17 fps most of time GOTY
7523	1	a	THIS GAME IS FUN , BUT MOSTLEY FOR THE MODS AND OTHER MULTIPLAYER
7525	1	a	my girlfriend hates this game.
7527	1	a	Arma 3 is a good game [It may have bugs but often they are the funny bugs with twisted necks and stretching soldiers] Many mods are made for the game often mods create a lot of extra playtime in my case I bought this because of Arma 2 and how I enjoyed it. I would recommend others who are thinking about buying this to go ahead there is so much you can do. With that said the Dev team are always releasing patch fixes to add more shine to the game.
7529	1	a	A much better improvement in the way that Arma plays and looks, I recommend this game to all Arma 2 fans and incourage people whom have never played Arma to try it.
7531	1	a	Let me its true extent is difficult to believe that this game is very good!
7533	1	a	If someone asks me what is the best game I have ever played, then without contemplation, I will definitely choose ArmA3. It has the best graphic I've ever seen, it satisfies the ultra-realism I've been looking for (I thought BF series were realistic) and last but not least, it makes gamers to jump into game-making. I doubt games better than this would come out any time because I strongly insist this is the most breath taking and innovative game I've ever seen.
7535	1	a	3 years later after release, still feels like it's in beta.
7537	1	a	Has a whole mess of amazing, and fun mods to play with, kind of like Mount and Blade: Warband. Basically it is Mount and Blade but with assault rifles... And tanks.
7539	1	a	10/10 Would Play Again!
7541	1	a	Most realistic war / military game ever. The game is very easy to mod and the community has ended up making some very fun gamemodes and a variety of mods. Some of my favorite custom gamemodes are 'Altis Life' and 'King of the Hill'. This game also has a ton of realism units / milsim units that do custom missions. Even though this game has been out for three years, it is still being worked on with new updates, maps, etc. The map 'Tanoa' is expected to come out sometime this year, and they just released the 'Eden 3D Editor' a couple days ago.   Overall this game is amazing. With the surplus of mods and gamemodes this game never gets old. If you are interested in buying this game you will need a good computer to run it. Some servers have custom veichles and other things that drops your FPS low. Also, this isn't like most games where you can just go play for 15 or 30 minutes. For gamemodes like 'Altis Life', I usually set aside 3-5 hours to play. But I'd give this game a 10/10 for the realism, and the easy access to mods.
7543	1	a	they should include sexual self-defense in their next update
7545	1	a	One day in Wasteland Sandbox, I found a car. Picked up the gun inside, and got in. Crashed into a small rock, entire car blew up. 11/10
7547	1	a	Playing with friends:  Gayfish 3: 'Homo one, are you in position? Over.'  Me: 'Gayfish three, I am in position. I can see three technicals and two footmobiles, over.'  Gayfish 3: 'Copy that homo one, wait for the sig---'   *Gayfish 3 is interrupted by loud â™¥â™¥â™¥ explosion  Me: 'NECROPHILIAC 1, WHAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DID YOU DO?!'  Necrophiliac 1: 'Homo one, it appears I accidently fired our only javelin missile into that big â™¥â™¥â™¥ motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' bush, over.'   Me *Turns to look at Necrophiliac 1  Necrophiliac 1 *Headshotted by 12.7mm MG on Technical, head explodes  Me: 'Jesus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my â™¥â™¥â™¥!'  *Grenade lands at my feet, explodes, I fly about 20 feet back into a wall.  Gayfish 3: 'Ha, y'all got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. Over.'  Me &amp; Necrophiliac 1: 'Yep, ayylmao.'  The game is really fun, playing it with friends makes it better. The only downside is that it is poorly optimized.  
7549	1	a	really awesome game to play, one of my best games
7551	1	a	+ Fantastic Graphics + Great Story + Huge Community + Lots Of Mods + Tea Bagging Simulator  + Amazing Audio + Role Playing  - 12 Year Old 'Police Officers' On Altis Life - Side Chat Spammers - â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Blatt?  - Rekt  I'd give this game a solid 9/10.
7553	1	a	Eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7555	1	a	Huge game. Many scenarios and Mods to get lost in. Low frame rates on many servers for me. Decent fps when i play Solo. Amazingly large maps. Great Visuals and Sound. Realistic. Definately not a run and gun game.
7557	1	a	Definitely one of my favorite military themed games of all time. I've had countless of fun experiences, intense firefights, and have met some interesting people. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a different experience, far away from COD or Battlefield. Vanilla I would say is a 7.5 (out of ten), and with mods a 9 out of ten. Fantastic.
7559	1	a	Best military simulator out there
7561	1	a	-Driving along with highly valuable stuff in vehicle.  -See's other vehicle coming my way thinking nothing of it.  -Desync.  -Crashes into each other.  -Both vehicles explode.  10/10 WILL loose everything too desync again.
7563	1	a	The Best Game Ever!!!
7565	1	a	love this game 10/10
7567	1	a	&gt;plays Arma 3  &gt;thinks he masters game &gt;finds out about ACE3 &gt;becomes novice   amazing
7569	1	a	Arma 3 is an amazing realistic military simulation game. The campaign/singleplayer itself is amazing, and the multiplayer just gets better. There are many servers and modifications you can make to the game to make it an even better experience.  I sold a knife in CS:GO for this game; It was worth it.
7571	1	a	This game is THE GAME.
7573	1	a	This Game is the best thing I have ever played in my life. It is so awesome.All the mods and workshop iteams. This game Has so many things to do.  Here is a small list  - arma 3 life - Battle royal - Wastland - Breaking point - Epoch  I really recomend this game.
7575	1	a	its... something
7577	1	a	Arma 3 is by far the most realistic, most entertaining, and most intence war simulator of all time! If the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen. consoles. Not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water! Keep up the good work Bohemia Interactive, and step aside Battlefield and COD because a new age has started. The age of a real war.
7579	1	a	No word to say.
7581	1	a	You thought Arma 2 was good?  In Arma 3 even the sound lags.  5/5FPS
7583	1	a	Helped me get alot of friends and has so many options on how to play thanks to mods and the editor. Virtually infinite possibilities with superb physics (sometimes) and graphics. Also has a fantastic community and great developers. The only thing that bothers me is the poor optimization on large servers. Above 50-60 people and fps takes a dive. Overall a great game and would definitely buy it again if I didn't have it.
7585	1	a	- Zip tied someone - Take them to the top of a church - Cut the poor soul's kidney out of their body - make them jump while being shot at and hearing gaben being chanted  best game - 10/10
7587	1	a	So after about a year of off and on playing, I thought id give it a review. One word. AMAZING. I dont understand how this game is so fun. Almost all of the (close to) 600 hours I have played on this has been in A3Armorys Stratis Server. I can play it for hours upon hours and not get too bored. Yes after 600 hours of stock arma the weapons, vehicles, gear does get really stale. And that brings me too mods. Mods make this game 10000x better. It brings new content into this game. So much new content that I dont think anyone will ever get bored. You have Life mods. You have Gun Game. You have Dayz. Theres so much replayability in this game. Theres so much to do. So much you can create. Its almost endless. With the addition of Apex this month we will have plenty of new guns, vehicles, gear to choose from when playing. This game is just simply awesome. It does have its downfalls. The lack of official content gets stale after alot of playtime. The optimization really sucks.(I get about 20-30 fps in wasteland stratis with full server) But I have so much fun its hard not to recomend it. You also have those really funny arma physics. So 11/10
7589	1	a	Im in love with this game
7591	1	a	Hello am 48 year man from somalia. Sorry for my bed englando. I selled my wife for internet connection for play '3 Arma' and very good chouse . 10 buy game
7593	1	a	The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.  
7595	1	a	i bought this game for $60 and the next day there was a 50% off sale. Not even mad about it.  11/10
7597	1	a	amazing graphics, though not compared to Crysis 2 or 3, but still very good considering what you get. this is not your average FPS game, this has a ton of features, meaning no matter what happens, this will likely remain a pc exclusive, as a controller simply don't have enough buttons for all the functions. it has a good single player campaign, and a very active online scene. it is a rather demanding game for any system, but i suspect this is due to the engine, and the fact it has to do so much at once.
7599	1	a	I don't even own this game. Why is it asking me for my review?
7601	1	a	Great game. IMO, more realistic than Arma 2, better graphics engine. I was able to run it in 1600x960p. Recoil is not that of a damn Barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. Cooler story and just overall an advancement from Arma 2. OP AF
7603	1	a	Fun game, If you get bored playing one game mode there are hundreds others to choose from, never ending fun!
7605	1	a	Welcome to the jungle...
7607	1	a	  This game is my favorite game and I think it always will be changed by the steam workshop.If your looking to buy a game where you can sink more than 1000 hours and still only touch a tiny part of the modding community this game is for you. :)
7609	1	a	I haven't played Arma 3 for that long but it's ok I guess....
7611	1	a	THE BEST GAME EVER!
7613	1	a	Kayzar thinks I play this game too much.
7615	1	a	Arma 3 is an AWESOME rpg just buy it
7617	1	a	My Quick review.  Arma 3 is probably the most user friendly entry into the series. Not to the mention the best looking, and in my opinion the most fun to play.  Now, thats not to say doesn't have issues. CURRENTLY, not as much content as the previous entries, but that said, BIS is working on more and its soon to come. Obviously the modder community is working feverishly away.  Steam workshop support for missions is great, and as soon as they add support for full Mods, everything will be even better.  The game plays as one would expect. Its a tactical simulator, so that means the average expericance wont be a firefight every few seconds. Tehre is waiting, there is walking, but if you're of the right mindset, it all adds to the experience and build up. Knowing only a few shots can kill you make it quite tense.  Key points- -The new stance system is great, a variable height and lean, means you can make the most out of any cover you find yourself in! - The maps are huge and varied, with the scenario editor you can quickly whip up any type of engagement you want. - The game is better multiplayer, if your more of a Solo player, I wouldn't say you'll have no fun, but I think it'd be more limited. - So many mods on the horizon, all will add up to be the experience you want, tailored to you.  So, all that said, I love this game. Devs are continuining support with regular updates and additions. Join a multiplayer community and prepare to have a blast!
7619	1	a	Great game bro
7621	1	a	Slice aproves this.
7623	1	a	recommend this game HAVANA6 screw betafail4 or 5
7625	1	a	Awesome Tactical gameplay, If you enjoy simulations, This is NOT COD or BF4!!!!
7627	1	a	First play session, join a random multiplayer server called altis life or something. get kidnapped by some form of terrorist group, they take me to an island and tell me to hide in a house, the police come and save me, they give me a car to go back to a town, have the car confiscated by the cops that helped me due to speeding, run for about an hour to the nearest town, get killed by a guy in his underwear and a fedora screaming about being mlg, leave game. 11/10 would play again!
7629	1	a	YOU CAN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IN SALUTE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT HEY GET THIS GAME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW
7631	1	a	I loved this game when my computer was good after about 6 months or so the game started crashing and getting low frames but before my computer turned into poo I loved this game but soon my time with the game was over ans wasnt able to play anymore if you want to take the risk take it. If you think this game is cool the review aren't stopping you buy it! 
7633	1	a	Great looking game. And the MOD's are just awesome. Don't get thoughts behind the DLC's tho..
7635	1	a	Good game but there is no shotguns :(
7637	1	a	its like Jesus had a baby and it took over the world. Yes its that good.
7639	1	a	It's okay.  Also gave me PTSD.
7641	1	a	The game is great! It is a very realistic war simulator that I highly recommend. It makes Call of Duty look like dog poop. There are a lot of mods that are fun to play. You can do just about anything in this game, fly helos, drive quads, trucks, tanks, shoot people, and much more. It just makes me mad that I bought it for $59.99 three days ago and today it is on sale for $29.99.  11/10 Would pay full price again.
7643	1	a	THIS game is very fun and entertaining. with new mods coming out it makes it more interesting and creative.
7645	1	a	Ok first off HOLY CRAP this game is sweet. If you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( I got mine for 30 i think) I would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. A great game thats lots of fun. You can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. If you liked Dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. But over all 10/10 would buy again. Seriously if your PC can handle it get it.
7647	1	a	Great game you wil have countless hours of fun just with the regular arma 3. Getting bored? Thats fine just jump on a multiplayer server like altis life and you will be able to get many more hours of fun! just make sure your pc can handle it.
7649	1	a	Great Game!!!
7651	1	a	Can someone please buy Arma 3 as a gift to me please :(???? You see, I am very poor and I just cant afford a game like Arma 3. I just love this intense game and it has a wonderful sensation. I wish I could just get my hands on it but I dont have the required amount of mey just yet. Im just begging anyone out there that is kind to buy me this game as a gift. It would touch my heart deep inside me ;). Im crying now as I type. If anyone out there has a heart that is strong enough to be generous I would Highly appreciate it :). Most people won't listen but it will be awesome. THANKYOU!!! ;)
7653	1	a	A very good fps/thirdperson shooter game. Perfect for RP and much more. 10/10 best you could get:D
7655	1	a	Absolute fantastic game. Very good simulation and good physics. Big open maps for dramatic scenery.
7657	1	a	This is one of the most complicated FPS games to play, as in there are a lot of control you need to learn to make your character move around in a organized way. Once you learn them however, the games becomes very fun, and difficult. So if you dont like a challenge this game is not for you. Some parts of the campaign I had to try (on regular) at least 20-30 times. Im a decent FPS player but is like no other I've played.   The game itself is very nice to look at, albeit not as optimized as I would like to see. It is also very heavility CPU based. My OC 4790k hovers around 20-50% usage, sometimes going into the high 60s. I play on very high at 5760x1080 and get around 55-70 fps on average with 970 SLI.   The gameplay is very different then any other game. The audio and realism is very good. Sometimes you really think you are a soldier and get scared when you are walking and suddenly hear bullet impacts near you. The gunplay is also very hard and challenging. You have to really be slow and careful on where you are how you plan to engage the enemy. Because they are very good shots and you die very easily. So you have to be strategic in everything you do. Which can be really fun.   This also is not a non-stop action game. There is a lot of walking and exploring. This is like a COD polar opposite.   Mods and custom content really add to the replayability and fun of this game. The fun never stops when you have all of the steam workshop and a few friends to play with.   Some things did bother me and broke the realism for me. One being that a nice combat simulator like this with accurate gun behaviors and recoil doesnt even have 2 different reload animations for guns, or when reloading when not empty you don't get 30+1. Also there is not very good animation in this game, reload, talking, and some player animation is not very smooth or realistic in many cases.   Overall I give it a 8/10 for what it was planning/supposed to be and how I received it.
7659	1	a	This game is absolutley wonderful. I have played about 11 hours of this game and i have not gotten bored yet. There is so much you can do in this game without even touching the multiplayer portion such as ; Build your own missions (scenarios). Yes, you can build your own missions once and if you get bored of the main campaign or you finish it. (2) The campaign- Now if you have the Apex DLC, you will have 2 campaigns available. I have not played the Apex campaign but the main campaign is absolutley exciting. If you are looking for a campaign similar to COD or Battlefield, then this is not for you, the missions require strategic thinking and smart tactics, you have to actually look for the enemies instead of them popping out in front of you. There is also no respawning (which some people may not like). However, you have the ability to patch yourself up after taking a non-critical hit and the game auto saves after passing certain points throughout the level. (3) Mods- Mods are a great addition to the game. You can either get Scenario mods, Campaign mods, Vehicle and Unit mods, or Game changing mods which mean they will put you through another Era in time and you can either download scenarios or campaigns with these mods. Examples of these are : Iron Front 3 for Arma, and Unsung vietnam. You can grab IFA3 here on the steam workshop, however you will have to do some searching for Unsung, it can be found on MODDB. Last but not least is Multiplayer. Now i have not played very much of the multiplayer becasue in my opinion, to really get the most out of multiplayer you should play it with friends. Now that is not to say don't play multiplayer because you dont have anyone to play it with, but communication is key in some game modes. Hope this review helped you in deciding whether or not to get this masterpiece of a game. Enjoy.
7661	1	a	11/10 BEST GAME EVER MADE (as of 05/11/2015)
7663	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield Teens play CS:GO Men play ARMA People waste there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lives in real war, and were trying to copy that.    OK LETS DO IT ;D
7665	1	a	I parachute into a hot zone. I hear the distant crackle of small arms fire. Kind of like fireworks. 4th of July... I snap out of it as the ground suddenly rushes up and meets me. I roll onto my stomach and crawl into a nearby bush. I jumped with 3 squad mates. Where are they? I glance around. One comes drifting down dead in his harness. The other is nowhere to be found. Tension builds in my belly as the chatter of nearby automatic weapons fire starts back up again. I gaze cautiously out into the outcropping of squat buildings ahead.   Is that where the fire is coming from? I can't tell. Can't be sure.  I am frozen.   There is a house across the street. The street is narrow. I could dash for it. But it might blow my cover. 50 meters never looked so far in my life. I get into a crouch. Glance around again. Suddenly I see smoke rising from a dusting of rocks to my left. I immidiately drop down and toss a grenade. It works, the enemy tango dashes from the rocks. A few swift pops and he's down. Was he alone?   There was no way to know for sure.   This is warfare. This is Arma.
7667	1	a	play dis gam cause realistic  http://i.imgur.com/UJGbDoc.gifv    10/10
7669	1	a	Great game to play with friends
7671	1	a	Very fun game. Playable for hours on hours. Great community, and lots of addons. Totally recommended.
7673	1	a	I highly recommend Arma 3 on sale. Arma 3 has a learning curve bit of a learning, but is unlike any shooter on the market.   Arma 3 is a bit buggy, so expect rage inducing lag and glitches from time to time. Turst me Booboo, it's most likely not your PC set up. With all the mods and servers that this game features, you are guaranteed to get countless hours of game play out of this game. The campaign story is laughable, but the AI is challenging if you're completionist.  Buy this game if you like:  Great Gun play Teamwork Realistic firefights Flying Helicopters or Jets Survival mods Fighting AI with your buddies PvP with a /steep/ learning curve  Pass on Arma 3 if you don't like:  Large keybind layouts Low framerates Working as a team Dying a lot Not being Rambo Having PTSD   Carry on Soldier.
7675	1	a	We made a convoy. I like convoys 11/8 Would convoy again
7677	1	a	i just love playing this game!! :3
7679	1	a	69/10
7681	1	a	This game is extremely realistic, with everything bullet ballistics to in-depth squad command. And if you aren't satisfied, there's a massive community that's always creating addons, modifications, and even full-conversion modifcations. The community also has another side where you can find friends and formulate tactical squads or even battalions. I highly recommend you check this game out, though do acknowledge that this game isn't perfect and does lack a lot of desired features. However, you can probably find those features within the modding community.
7683	1	a	Playing this game on a public server with random people will make you hate this game. Playing this game on a private server with a chosen few will make you love this game.  
7685	1	a	Very cool game, love the campaign and the mods avaialble are limitless.
7687	1	a	got spawn killed by a man with a handgun, then he hunt me down just to take my clothes and dignity.  10/10 would play again
7689	1	a	Excelent game if u like making plays
7691	1	a	Game = Mods  Great game! Constant hours played on 'Altis Life' and 'A3L'. The fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it, most will agree with me! I think the highlight of what made Arma 3 a popular game was the Altis Life Mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do RP within the game, that mod is recommened. However despite having nearly 150hours just on Altis Life, a new mod 'A3L' i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. The mod is a other RP mod like Altis Life however more shops, a new map [Lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. From robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop, you can do it all for yourself here. Arma 3 is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure, you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. Note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [NO MORE DESYNC].  Ratings below:  Arma 3 [No Mods]: 5/10 Arma 3 [Mods]: 10/10  Thanks
7693	1	a	This game takes practice and boy once you become fairly skilled this game really begins to kick off, the game does well to teach you things using a fun story mode and extra tutorials. This game has an alright community and i love the DLC!
7695	1	a	love this game i keep spending all my hours on it
7697	1	a	it's alright
7699	1	a	Awesome game love this game :D
7701	1	a	ArmA 3 is an excellent military sandbox, You don't buy it for the Singleplayer. You buy it for the Community mods and addons. You could really never run out of things to try or play.
7703	1	a	The Bad Default campaign   The Good Pretty much everything else  If you aren't going to play multiplayer then don't bother with this game.
7705	1	a	by far one of the most expensive games i bought (lel). besides from that it is also one of the funnest. Atlis Life is best. Love love love. iz like sperm
213	0	a	I'd like to say I like the game and i'm a fan, would i recommend this game to people 'nope' not until they fix the 'sway' down sight, you run 3 feet, you sway, you crawl you sway....you fart, you sway...people are going to say it's 'realistic' that is bull....I hope no one in our armed forces are that wimpy and get tired that fast. if you want to know what it is like for michael j fox in his daily life buy this game...because that is what you'll be getting, a michael j fox shooting game.
7707	1	a	It takes a while to get used to the controls and everything but after that u have one of the best most fun open world game in the world. I will suggest tho if your new start with the campiagn without watching walkthroughs and then play a bit of Altis life life but overall i would definetly recommened it.
7709	1	a	one of the best games
7711	1	a	Got shot for and apple. 10/10
7713	1	a	One of the best games out there with countless mods to play and try and so many servers with different modes such as Altis life, Wasteland, Arma 3 Life, Exile, Epoch, etc. this game has it all if you are into Military Sims or just FPS's in general, you don't have to have the worlds best PC to run it but you do need at least an alright one, Ive played this game ever sense i got my PC and i can't say that there was a ever a dole moment with this game it just has so much things to do its a must buy.
7715	1	a	The game is great, its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.
7717	1	a	Updated review: I have been exploring more features of Arma 3 and I love it!   I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible.  My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are:  Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server.  Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates!  Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter.  The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure.  Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge!  While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to.  I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull.  I highly recommend it!
7719	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD :)))))
7721	1	a	This is one of the most interesting and expansive games out there. The current storyline and background is a bit unrealistic-The Republic of Altis and Stratis has a super-advanced military but the nation has under 50,000 people in its population. The population also is Greek, but for whatever reason all speaks english-even the armed forces. Nonetheless, the mission editing is superb compared to Arma 2, the mechanics are mostly improved (animation and AI needing a bit of a change for realism) the voice acting for British and American English as well as Farsi is superb. Iran has a huge presence in the game, however it is never mentioned and instead goes under the quite unrealistic banner of Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty, or CSAT. I really wish that BIS would at least include the Iran flag above the CSAT insignia on the uniforms, for it looked absolutely amazing when this was the case at E3 2011. Physics in the game are great, however the fabled ragdoll physics are a bit dissapointing. All they seem to do is make units die in a more unrealistic-looking way. NATO is portrayed as completely bankrupt which really bothers me-unemployment is at freaking 50% in the US. It is interesting to see future interpretations of the US Army, which use the new multicam pattern in their uniforms. I am bothered by the lack of ANY, yes ANY authentic equipment in the game. This is perhaps my biggest problem, for it gives the developers an excuse to make fantasy content for every upcoming Arma game. Yes, it saves on lisencing, but the developers just launched a 650-thousand dollar modding contest. A fraction of the money could have been spent on making the weapons and vehicles authentic.   With a host of friends to play with, some mods, and an open mind, this title is one of the most awesome games I have ever played. The simulation of the vehicles is amazing, with support for almost every joystick, controller, or other external device you can think of. The game fails to provide an immersive atmosphere but is a fun and engaging way to play COOP with friends, strategy being completely necessary. The graphics are in my top 10 games ever, and the performance is better than with Arma 2, especially if you plan on making Youtube videos like I do. (check out my Youtube channel: FistoGames :D ) Go and buy it. With some DLC's that bring it back to where Arma 2 was in scenario, it will definitely be an amazing game.        
7723	1	a	Glitchy as hell but addictive
7725	1	a	ArmA is one of the best games I have ever played, but be warned it is nothing like your mainstream shooter like Battlefield or Call of Duty. ArmA presents you with quite a challenge, because the AI is hard and unforgiving (sometimes even unfair) and weapons, vehicles and damage all feel quite realistic.  I recommend getting the DLC Pack with it and (as soon as it releases) getting the expansion. The DLCs bring cool new content to the game and it is a great way to additionally support the Developers  ArmA can also be greaty improved with mods, to anyone new to the game: Check out mods like TFAR, ACE3, ASR AI and RHS:Escalation
7727	1	a	Amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel (aka simulator) hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor. The controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down. Being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do. I would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring. That is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there.
214	0	a	I bought this game day 1 of steam release, it was pretty barebones stuff, a few guns, even less vehicles, 1/3 a campaign.  They said more weapons would come, (if you know arma 2, they had dozens of weapons, arma 3 however had less than 10)  well more weapons did come, in the form of paid DLC.  More vehicles, more paid DLC.  Scumbag moves
7729	1	a	This game is worth every cent. It is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.
7731	1	a	Love it! Though I wish I had a better graphics card (gt 750m).
7733	1	a	Arma 3 brings so much different game types to the table. From Altis Life which is a crazy GTA Online style clone that is better, to full on war simulator with ari, land, troops. There is so much to do in this game. If you can't find something to do in this game then you need to get to a Doctor quick... cause you might be dead. :) Enjoy.
7735	1	a	Good game, played it for the free weekend. Nek minute I put my cd key in and I had to reinstall the whole game... 10/10
7737	1	a	After the steep learning curve it's really good fun. Beware, it seems very graphics intensive.
7739	1	a	If you are looking for something to do.  If you are bored. If you like some resistance. If you really like teamwork. If you don't like teamwork but can be around people. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GAME!!!   You will always have something new to learn, fix, repair or just curse with this game! In game, you can create what the duck you what.  Trying to install mods, it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly, but in the end it's worth it.  I have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people. Even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running Rambo in a town.  Just saying... 2000+ hours in A2, 1000+ hours in A3, and I never feel like giving up on arma. I would marry this game. Because I would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game.  12/11.9 points!
7741	1	a	This game is a sandbox, and what you get out of it is what your imagination or the community behind you puts into it.
7743	1	a	*****
7745	1	a	It's almost as if it's real.
7747	1	a	set everything to low and still got 20 fps  10/10 Optimization
7749	1	a	Great game, load it up, optimize the sttings using GeForce. joins a game with a friends who recomended it. ... get 7 frames. thinks, meh if i just put all my settings on low. it will increase fps right? NO ultra settings: 7 fps low settings : 7 fps ... it's playable right? no * walks around * *gets shot from somewhere* * gets dragged to a medic by a friend * * gets revived * * sees enemy * * tries to aim with 7 fps * *dies * ... i would reccomend if you have a beastly pc. but do not try to play on an outdated laptop.
7751	1	a	It has ISIS now
215	0	a	dont buy this game. its not finished. there is no story, there are bugs, ai is stupid,........ bohemia doesnÂ´t give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about releases they promised. we are still waiting for the 2nd part of the campaign that should have been released - as promised - in december. now the tell us it will be february. its a sanbox and without community developers this game would worth 0.- I highly recomment to wait a few months.
7753	1	a	Ok so the bottom line is, this is not just a shooter, its not just a multiplayer shooter similar to the likes of Black ops 2, AW or anything like that, it is as close to a military simulator. I love KOTH(King of the Hill) great game &amp; can be played as alone wolf or with friends. I have to give this 11/10
7755	1	a	It's ight 9.99/10
7757	1	a	best army simulator game
7759	1	a	one of the best
7761	1	a	great game:)
7763	1	a	This game is racist
7765	1	a	Looted the corpse of my fallen comrade and took his sunglasses.  10/10 respec for your fallen bredas.
7767	1	a	great game grhapichs amazing gameplay mods 10/10/ wouild buy again
7769	1	a	Most realistc and funnist game I have ever played!!!
7771	1	a	Ah the good ol' Arma III. Lets get started.  Arma, a mil-sim game by Bohemia, how is it played? Custom game modes. Yes, there's a campaign, yes you can do the mil-sim related tasks and wage war against other mil-sim players, but this game isn't typically played like that. Custom maps like: Altis Life, King of the Hill, Battle Royale Mod, etc are how most people end up playing and enjoying this game.  As of this writing I play this game, for the most part, once or twice a week, but as you can see I've logged hundreds of hours on this game. That should speak quite a bit in regards to the fun factor. Whether you want to Role-Play with other players (who 50/50 just shoot anyways), play a giant game of king of the hill with big guns and vehicles, or just play an hour long survival last man standing kind of game... Arma III offers it.  Downsides to this game, bugs, lots of them, expensive DLC, and one of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. The game would greatly benefit from a way more optimized engine that doesn't tank a modern PC under 60FPS by just being in a town.   Once again, that said, you can spend hundreds of hours entertaining yourself in the world that is Arma and I do highly reccomend this game for all shooter fans.
7773	1	a	I LIKE DIS GAME CUZ U CAN GO BOOM BOOM INTO BAD GUY
7775	1	a	This game is amazing and i havent played multiplayer yet :P. Dandellion have to get this and play with me.
7777	1	a	Great game I would suggest to the people that love army simulator games
7779	1	a	this game brout me 2 tear first time i play.... wow...!....wat a xpereance.  truly beutifull game play  12\10/7
7781	1	a	  A3 compared to A2 had strong and weak sides: good things are: new engine. more offloading to GPU among GFX things atleast(and DX10 support, btw. DX12 promised in Tanoa). new editor. somewhat rehauled/reworked core modules, generally 'for good'. bad/disapointing things are: less content. gear, vehicles, features ingame. ugly setting in stock package, both art, islands, vehicles collection, 'alternative future' era touch with bat[cenzored]crazy opinions about that 'future' in terms of miltech state of. but thats more about personal taste. but choice about 'sunset' as editor default perhaps Good thing. AI and physics code not really scalable/multicore(thanks' to intel libraries and lack of message-passing code(developers with ada/smalltalk/haskell/erlang experience is rare asset to sieze) and one-sided profiling of binaries. even more obvious/eye-wrapping/scratching post-processing. but not uniform 'bloom' as in A2, but DoF and color-based things 'console'-style and generally DayZ-alike 'casualisation' isn't thing i welcome in Arma, frankly-speaking. no 64-binaries(and A3 dataset is HUGE. even w/o serious(and A2/A3 may look truly Beatiful with it and aircrafts playable)viewdistance and mide or small-sized islands with huge gridsstep. despite persistent modders efforts to fix most obvious gaps(like decent islands, gear, etc)generally major flaws was engine(it buit atop)itself and incomplete(or incoherent with)documentation(i Do really miss OFP:R-era Very documented engine/syntax, examples, references), tools/sdk(especially landscape editor, perhaps). so after DX12 most important things for A3 would be: putting 64-bit engine(for both client AND server)into actions, making A3 really-multithreading or better relying about Message-passing code(preferably over some ERlang code, perhaps. considering scalability advantages even against other MP-langs or MP-libs/wrappers to overcome)especially in AI code(most stress, even in ~ short battles/matches). generally i would recommend A3. but not for casual gamers. if you one of newbie in milsim or even in action games at all - you may be disapointed/frustrated at first time or even angry(if you read some reviews - you may had expressions of). its game for gamers really Knowing what they need and why. cuz most fun in A3 rolled over three things: teamplay, challenge, replayabliliy. and editability/moddabiliy.(but it worth another, separated review i guess).
216	0	a	Terrible multiplayer optimization with those who have AMD chips. Running an 8 core bulldozer AMD CPU with 8GB of DDR3 and a R9 270x and I cant get over 15-20Fps tops while online (no matter the server). Terrible. Its a known issue with this game engine, but it looks like there isnt any hope in site in the near future. Otherwise I think id like this game. I really have no use for the single player, so im not sure about it. I do know its playable on most rigs, even AMD ones. But I bought this one for the MP and I cant play it, so....not sure how good it is gameplay wise really. (PS-its not just my setup that causes these issues either. I couldnt run it any better with my AMD FX-6100 6 core with samsung DDR3 and a HD 7770 GPU).
7783	1	a	Arma 3 is not your typical first person shooter. It is a military simulation. It truely is one of, if not, the most immersive games I have ever played. The amount of tactical realism this game offers is like no other shooter out there. Arma 3 rewards the player for having good tactics, teamwork, and communication, over twitch reflexes like in other vanilla shooters. If you're a fan of anything military, or just like strategic, tactical gameplay, especially with friends, i would definately recommend this title.
7785	1	a	not enough content wtf?
7787	1	a	If you like realism and military stuff.... Just BUY this game! This game also have a tons of mod, like epoch, exile, ace, etc.
7789	1	a	you have a friend? play this game  you dont have friend? play this game  you dont have this game? buy the game you dont have money? get a job you dont have job? die â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dieee !
7791	1	a	Good army game, you can actually kill vehicule with rocket unlike Battleshit 4 where you can heal tank with electrical screwdriver that are more powerfull than rockets. 9/10
7793	1	a	A yo dude dis is te â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if yo want to shoot sum of dose cops niqqua. DAMN DIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS LIKE DEtroit LIKE BAGHDAD NIQQUA GOOAAD DAAYM
7795	1	a	I bought this game when it was pre-order, or early acces. I can't remember. Played it for a few minutes, but couldn't find a good community to get into with the multiplayer. It's been about almost a year now, and I've come back to this game to realize I absolutely love it. Arma 2 was good. I had a love hate relationship with it. I tried and tried to find a decent multiplayer server, but I could not. However, I did a bit of digging around and found a great KOTH infantry only server and I'm in love. I'm a HUGE diehard Socom fan and I love the 3rd person feel to the game. Arma 3 fills that spot and I can already tell hours of my soul will belong to Arma now. I don't have a high end pc but I can still hang and contribute a lot towards helping my team win. The movement is better, as well as the overall feeling towards the mobility of your soldier. I give this a thumbs up. I have nothing to complain about. If you love Socom get this game. Play Koth infantry only. You may need to download an Arma 3 launcher that has a lot of other servers on it that deal with mods. Anywhoo, I highly recommend this game.
7797	1	a	well I only have 100 hours on this one. But that's enaugh after I've played nearly 2000 hours of ArmA 2 OA with and without the DayZ mod.(440 or so hours wasteland, 220 hours on a single dayz server and about 150 - 200 on multiple other DayZ epoch servers via DayZ commander) The game is simply improved, it runs better than the old one does (at least on my system), looks great, is less clunky. The game is set in future (I dislike this bit) Is a time cow as alaways. To newcomers this game takes time. There are no quick 10 minute rounds. The meat of the game for me is on 120 people wasteland servers, where it takes time to get gear, takes time to travel, takes time to siege and objective and so on. An average paly session will last from 2 hours and up (If you want to acctualy acomplish something).   10/10 would recomend if you can run it.   Howerver I'd simply suggest picking up ArmA 2 when it's avalible for 5 or less euros, since the price is quite steep when not on sale and you're either going to love this (like I do) or hate it.   It's not comparable to Battlefield or Call of Duty. And even more so it's false to think that liking any of those games will make you like ArmA as well.  Also when deciding on making your purchase take a good hard look will you be able to run this game and if can play a game on 30 fps. I'm all PC master race guy with atleast full HD and 60fps as a requirment, however without the latest and greatest rig it's hard to swim around 60fps in this title. SP runs well, very well even, but when it comes to MP your expierence is close to unpredictable. On some servers you'll be running great and on some you'll have 10fps no matter what you do.   This game is uniqe. It's more like tools and materials that can be used to create a beautifull house, than the house itself. If you want to expierence the construction of your house rather than getting one already built, there is no better title than this one. 
7799	1	a	Very fun game. But downfall of it is that you need some of your friends to play in order to have lots of fun. + the AI cheat
7801	1	a	This is one of the most fun games ive ever played 
7803	1	a	I have played this game for a long time and have also played arma 2. I would call this game one of the best games out there. There is so many things that you can do that it just does not end.    If you are looking for a new game to buy I would say Arma 3 is a great chose.
7805	1	a	This game is one of my favoutites and you just dont run out of things to do, there is all these custom missions, and lots Of different gamemodes only con is this game needs pretty good computer to run with max graphics
7807	1	a	This game is definitely a direct improvement over Arma 2. If you are familiar with that game, it is very easy to transition over to this game. I especially enjoy the mission editor. The mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve, but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editor's logic. The game is much better optimized than Arma 2 was, but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer, even with a high spec PC. I ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer, because the fps largely relies on the server's power. On single player or a small server of 5-10 people, I could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. I am disappointed with the DLC though, as it really doesn't add much at all to the game at this point, and it retails at $25. I would recommend picking this game up, even if you have never played the other Arma games, because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles, but is still just as in-depth. This game is a good purchase, especially on sale, the DLC on the other hand is not currently worth it.
7809	1	a	this game is only good if you remember the controls, and to remember the controls, you will need a PhD in quantum physics and engineering.
7811	1	a	Great Game
7813	1	a	1. Run cocaine wit ur boi's 2. Love your mother 3. Make money 4. F**K Bi**hES 5. ?????? 6. Profit
7815	1	a	I found this game 'fun, entertaining and breath taking' action packed
7817	1	a	tbh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ vanilla game. Awesome modded game  8.7/10
7819	1	a	amazing game full of epic mods worth every penny just buy it lol.
7821	1	a	Great game, but fps is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ most of the time and the paywall stopping you from using dlc content is really annoying.
7823	1	a	Arma 3 is really fun, but sometimes can get really boaring when not playing wiht anyone or without interacting with other players.
7825	1	a	Any sane person would say this game is bad... I am not sane. This has got to be the most fun I've had with a game in a long time.
7827	1	a	This game is one of the most realistic war simulators ever, I have got over 2300 hours right now and it is one of the most addicting games I have played in a long time. There are so many game modes from TDM to survival and roll playing, it is well worth the money. If you have friends that play it then it makes it so much better. 100% recomend it to every one who wants to get! 
7829	1	a	I love it.
7831	1	a	Almost 40 hours into the game and I can honestly say it's the best game I've purchased on Steam, amazingly fun, action packed and a lot of things to do, never gotten tired of it and I'll continue to play it until I find another game as funny as this one.
7833	1	a	Let's just say it's awesome 
7835	1	a	this game is awesome that is all!
7837	1	a	it ok till u hit fence then gota walk 20k
7839	1	a	This game is the BEST army simulator anyone will ever play. I like how you can pick about anything for your character to use or wear. Every thing is realistic in this game and i highly recomend this game!
7841	1	a	10/10 would play again 
7843	1	a	Almost a perfect infantry combat experience. The peripheries aren't quite polished, especially air combat, and there is a lack of content in the base game, but the ability to make mods for this game is what really makes it shine. Overall I give this game a 9/10
7845	1	a	I think this game is great buy it omg im crying to my mom because she slaps the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of me please help she wanted me to review this game help
7847	1	a	Well i had it then Steam took it away from me. :(
7849	1	a	Such a good game. Don't get it if you have a bad pc!
7851	1	a	Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright.  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air 
7853	1	a	Very strategic and requires skill more than anything. 
7855	1	a	Very fun, will play for years.
7857	1	a	this is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game i have ever played if you are thinking about getting it dont because otherwise you are an fajit so you can suck my an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bruh and its not freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee betch
7859	1	a	I have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or it's too laggy. Yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics, knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad. In my opinion this game is very fun. It is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you. Getting shot in the head will kill you. When sniping there is bullet drop. I love this game not only for its graphics, but mostly for the gameplay.    I will note that I reccomend having friends to play with on the game because it's not so fun alone. Well at least there are some nice people in the game, others willbe totlal douches as a teamate. I love to play gamemodes such as King of the Hill, Wasteland, and Battle Royal but not so much.    I will rate this game a 8.25/10 due to the lag even on low setting. Also if you have the settings too low for your computer, the game will lag, I can play this game at 50FPS on ultra settings.
7861	1	a	Awesome game recommend it to everyone !!
7863	1	a	Best, and most modular game I've ever played. I've never been so addicted to any game, this much
7865	1	a	Probably the best game out there if you have friends to play it! Endless scenarios and campaigns being added in the workshop. Not recommended for too casual players, quite a learning curve to really understand the game.
7867	1	a	It's like a 1000 games in one
7869	1	a	was fun
7871	1	a	The graphics are great, and there is a lot of stuff in the game from mortars to drones, helicopters and jets, tanks, civillian and millitary transport vehicles etc. It requires a great deal of skill to pilot/use some of these. The multiplayer is really good, and you can play Altis Life RPG, Wasteland, Co-Op, king of the hill and more. 85% of community is great and much more mature compared to other FPS games. The only thing I don't like very much is infantry movement, not sure why though, feels different. Overall it's a great experience, I recommend it.
7873	1	a	There are lots of bugs and poor design choices, that's for sure. The graphics aren't that great and the game runs like crap (sometimes 25 fps on my top end system). The game can also be really boring and frustrating (like when you get stuck on rocks and have to restart a 2 hour mission).  That said, I definitely recommend this game for someone who's tired of the same ol arcade shooters. Before I played Arma, I thought Battlefield 3 was a military simulator (lel). This game is nothing like call of duty. In arcade shooters like CoD, there's tons of action, all the time, and it gets mind numbing. In Arma, action is pretty infrequent, but when it does happen it's really intense and unforgiving. The missions are also very sandbox; you can plan out your own strategies instead of just running through ACTIONPACKED!!!!!, repetitive levels.  It's a hard game to learn. It uses almost every button on the keyboard. To this day I still don't know how to do some things, such as use laser guided bombs. If you're looking for a challenging, intense 'true pc game' you can't go wrong with Arma III.
7875	1	a	Verry fun many bugs
7877	1	a	Best military simulator ever... Want to experience some hardcore â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ not COD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t? try it, buy it, enjoy it.
7879	1	a	Awesome game, quality, top preformance. More than 500 mods great and realistic physics, best combat simulator. Awesome game ! I recommend it 100%
7881	1	a	The best military simulator! If you enjoy realism, run out and buy now!
7883	1	a	No, this is in no way better than Call of Duty, I feel cheated with this game, it's too hard and endlessly complex.
7885	1	a	When I started my first mission in coop I ended up dieing in the first few seconds. Little did I know how to fly a helicopter but I wasn't going to have anyone hold me back! took down 10 guys..not sure if they were on my team. 10/10
7887	1	a	I've played it every once in a while. Would recommend
7889	1	a	Arma 3 is a game, with simulation elements. It's not a simulator.   It is also a game for a specific type of gamer that prefers large scale warfare, instead of playing casual fast-paced shooters like COD or BF. If you enjoy the experience from briefing and planning , and executing a plan , no matter how it plays out, the game adapts to any playing style that fits your style. Run &amp; gun still works, but you need to have some uber micro skills..   If your mission fails, Arma allows you to retreat and get out alive, or gives you the oppertunity to get it done in another way. That's a nice touch compared to games that usually let the game end right after a fail. (SP)  A bullet in the head will kill you, a bullet in your ballistic helmet might save your life, get shot in your legs and you're have to crawl your way out of there..   Things you have to consider in real life come close to the decisions you have to make in this game.   Playing multiplayer with a group of people make the experience even better, but this game isn't really 'finished'. While the tags say it's a full release, Bohemia keeps working for years on these games to improve and add more content. They've done the same thing to their previous titles.   If you really care about Multiplayer, I suggest Arma 2 :CO.    Pro/cons :  + Mission Editor Large scale warfare Mods (Armaholic &amp; Bis forums) Steam workshop - User Generated 'Mission' Content (Mods in future?) All kinds of vehicles (Air, Cars, Armor, Support, and so on) +270 km2 map to explore  - Multiplayer performance still crap. AIR vehicle (MH-/AH-) lost turnspeed, please add a slider to have us configurate our own speed on pedals. Setting sensitivity to high, still have slow pedal movement &gt;_&lt; Those small choppers are able to quickly rotate , but now it's a slow , long and horrible turn. No co-op in Campaign?. (Co-op game plox!) AI moves unnatural (They behave like androids)
7891	1	a	There are no servers in Asia but the game is pretty enjoyable nonetheless.
7893	1	a	ArmA 3 is THE most detailed combat simulator you can find for a PC . There's much improvement from ArmA 2 , including smarter UI, more natural feeling movement and so on. Community support is excellent, with mods and scenarios created by the day, keeping the game fresh for a long time. A must buy if you are looking for a more 'serious' shooter than your average Counter-Strike.

7897	1	a	I think ArmA 3 one of the most dangerous game to review in whole ocean of the Steam Games. Because of its style, many people don't like this game at all and compare it with the other games like BF3, CoD series. However it is another story. First of all it is a military simulation which offers you to  realism . I have been playing ArmA series for about 100 hours now and I haven't thought leave it yet.  If you  like  slow developed action, the tactical thinking rather than just fire everywhere and have couple of friends to cooperate this game will be in your dreams when you shut it down and sleep. The mission making system, modding support and huge map is definetely make this game better than many of the First Person Games,  in my opinion . 
7899	1	a	Great game, Worth every $$$

7907	1	a	Tis a great game...
7909	1	a	I remember seeing screenshots of Arma 1 and thinking 'Wow, this game must keep me entertained for months', but after obtaining it I quickly changed my mind and thought what a buggy piece of crap this is, me being a somewhat casual gamer back then. The game was a total disaster to me and made me think 'How could they even call this a game?' The best part were the voice commands. Move. To. That. Building. At.. SIX O'CLOCK! Not to mention the game ran like crap. (Only arma players know what crap means.) (This was obviously ~6 years ago, so I was a bit younger then aswell)  Well, I had a friend in xFire who I shared a similar fate with, but for some reason we decided to try it out together anyway. What we did was the sample Seize the area -mission that you can automatically create from the editor. Suddenly the game wasn't so bad after all. Everything that it lacked in the usual things you have in FPS games it gained back in gameplay and the complexity of the game. Suddenly the trademark buggyness and clumsyness of the engine (which is still present) was a feature instead of a problem. We played it for about 60 hours straight after that, downloading mods, missions and whatnot.  Then came Arma 2. Being a moneyless kid I was, I couldn't buy it. So we tried different cracks, playing through hamachi LAN with the same CD-Key and whatnot, but got beaten by the anti-crack software it had built in. Now you might think that's cause of our amateurism, but really it was cause nobody played the game back then and nobody could create working cracks. Literally, there was maybe 1000 players around the world who had bought the game. Eventually I managed to buy the game and spent countless hours on it until it was time to put it on the shelf.  And then, maybe two years later, came DayZ and probably a million more players cause of it.  Suddenly there were keygens, cracks.. - whatever you needed to bypass the protection. Also, the mainstream gamer had found out what kind of possibilites the Arma engine can provide (dayz being the example). This was something the game developers deserved for putting so much effort to the series.  And now, cause of this success, Arma 3 is here. It's basically Arma 1 and 2 with a bigger budget. I wouldn't have ever thought during my Arma 1 days that it would ever get this popular.   What Arma 3 features: - Excellent graphics - The most realistic military simulation there is - Huge map - Good modability: This has always been a strong point in the series, just check Armaholic and steam workshop and you'll find all sorts of things for your liking. - Possibility to design scenarios with endless different ways: Want a mission where you have to sneak through enemy lines and assasinate an officer? You got it. - Excellent co-op gameplay. - Trademark clumsyness to a lot of things, which will become a feature once you get used to it.  But.. if you're a codfag; you need to give the game some time. It's not your usual casual FPS where everything is scripted and whatnot. And get someone to play with.
7911	1	a	Its fun but not great, PVE vs AI you lose close combat(they shoot thru bushes ect) PVP working good if you have a good PC,you dominate the game Making your own map playing with friends for fun or adding some cool addons. 
7913	1	a	i would like to test arma 3 out can you make it free for like 3 days please?
7915	1	a	by far the best game i have ever played yet keep up the good work
7917	1	a	ive played it a few times. its okay
7919	1	a	The Arma series has become an amazing masterpiece throughout its past 15 years of development. With backing from previous games and mods such as Arma 2 and the DayZ mod the developers have made it into a work of art. Arma 3 really finalizes the series for me, with more DLCs on the way and improved bullet ballistics and combat realism this truly is the mil-sim to rule them all. Along with the addition of the Apex expansion came more weapons and vehicles which drastically improved gun variety and the number of combat situations. Overall amazing game and I would definitely reccomend it if you like 'Serious Fun' (in Shack Tac terms) then you need to get this game.
7921	1	a	Bohemia Interactive's Arma 3 is the lastest iteration of a long-running series of realistic military sandbox titles, where the common themes have consistently centred upon player freedom, flexibility of action and movement, an expansive open world setting, an impressive degree of virtual realism and a passionate player community.   Set in the near future, Arma 3 presents the player with the sprawling, high-fidelity terrain of Altis, a war-torn Mediterranean island in the Agean Sea caught up in the building tensions between NATO and the growing influence of an eastern military alliance known as CSAT. This simmering geopolitical state of play serves as the core backdrop to the title's 3-part singleplayer campaign and persists as the central theme and justification of the game's simulated conflict.    The island of Altis itself is an immense, detailed and truly immersive canvas upon which the player is free to realise practically any military scenario of their imagining; where the journey from point A to point B can easily encompass many kilometres and where topography and geographic features can collude to radically alter player tactics. Based loosely upon the real island of Lemnos, Altis is able to achieve a uniquely natural feel to its coasts, rolling hills and forests and stands as a great testament to the skill and dedication of Bohemia interactive's map designers. Even while pinned under withering enemy fire, one cannot help but be struck by its beauty and authenticity.    Arma 3 also offers up a plethora of near-future military hardware; from various firearms, transports, logistical supports, infantry fighting vehicles, main battle tanks, helicopters as well as fighter jets and boats. The assets are generally very well modelled with distinct individual characteristics which make driving a quadbike a very different experience from that of a lumbering metal behemoth. While the helicopter flight dynamics are driven by Bohemia's optional, challenging but immensely rewarding advanced flight model, fixed-wing aircraft in Arma 3 remain the begrudging recipients of a comparatively rudimentary flight model that is perhaps a reflection of the series' traditional focus on ground-centric gameplay.   Given the near future setting, it is pertinent to note that much of the title's military assets are modelled upon real-life prototype weaponry, as well as a few present day variations met with a degree of developer artistic licence and fabricated designations. This notable departure from the well-established and popular modern day armaments that featured so prominently within previous titles in the series is undoubtedly a bold move by Bohemia, and one that still remains a divisive point of discussion within the player community.   The sounds of Arma 3, traditionally a less impressive facet of previous titles in the series, has undergone a marked improvement in this latest offering. Sustained post-launch updates to sound attenuation, super-sonic bullet cracks along a general reboot of the veracity of weapon fire in general have improved Arma 3's soundscape immeasurably, ensuring that the aural experience of its virtual warfare remains an authentic, often terrifying but ultimately satisfying assault upon the senses.    Arma 3 also comes bundled with an incredibly powerful mission editing suite which places the player in complete control of the entirety of the game's imposing asset list. It is in this mode, perhaps more so than any other where the title truly shines as a sandbox experience. With a little practice and experimentation, the player is able to construct fully realised military scenarios of varying complexity, for themselves, their friends or the community at large with objectives limited only by the bounds of the author's imagination. This uninhibited freedom, a cornerstone of the series, remains wonderfully present within Arma 3's core offering.     It would be almost criminally irresponsible to discuss Bohemia's flagship franchise without a brief mention of Arma's imperious modding community and the staggering host of improvements, fixes, overhauls and tweaks that this vibrant collection of talented indivduals provides. Whether one seeks to reintroduce real-life armies and modern-day weapon sets to their virtual arsenal, to aquaint oneself with a fresh new terrain upon which to wage war, or to apply a simple yet powerful overhaul to realism, the impressive array of user-made mods make this possible. Player created content has persisted as an important keystone of the series' appeal and longevity since its debut and continues to form an integral part of Arma 3's broader experience.    Players new to the series may find themselves understandably intimidated by the sheer bredth and depth of the content on offer, not to mention some of the more unforgiving aspects of the simulation. Thankfully Boehemia Interactive have introduced a host of means to facilitate the familiarisation process in the form of an in-game field manual and hint system, an introductory campaign, a Tron-esque virtual reality terrain and even providing the means for more experienced players to act as 'drill instructors' to teach newer players the ropes online. While a handful of frustrating AI, user interface, animation and optimisation/stability querks persist, Bohemia Interactive have created what is easily the most accessible title in the franchise to date.     As a reflection of Arma 3's flexibility, this is a title that has come to mean many different things to its expansive playerbase and one that can be played in a huge variety of different modes and playstyles. As a result Arma 3, perhaps more so than any previous iteration in the series, has seemed to grapple increasingly with the fallout of its own versatility. Attempting to establish a consensus on exactly how the game 'should be played' has become an increasingly tenuous prospect and one that is arguably unnecessary.    In the creation of Arma 3, Bohemia Interactive has taken upon the unenviable task of treading the fine middle-ground that exists between sustaining the high degree of realism that the series is famous for, while attempting to preserve fun and engaging gameplay for newcomers or those unacclimatised to a realistic simulation experience. 'Realism' itself, has proven to be an immensely subjective term within a virtual setting, and one that invariably means vastly different things to different players. The finer points of the title's realism with respect to certain game features remains a continual point of contention within the player community and one that appears unlikely to abate any time soon.    Arma 3's greatest triumphs then are to be found in its versatility and impressive open-world gameplay. Players are offered near total freedom, a staggering choice of armament, and a mandate to pursue their objectives however they see fit employing tactics entirely of their own design. This is a hugely layered and expansive sandbox title offering the player a unique gameplay experience and a gaming platform that has earned the rightful praise of many loyal fans.

7935	1	a	There's not much to say about Arma, so many crazy stories come out of it.  Once me and Two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings, we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks. We spot a building we wanted to check for loot, except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills.  So my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there, I had a grenade on me, I took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place (So my friends could take it for me if I died), Took a grenade and a Pistol. I launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy, I went Rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out.  So Yeah.....10/10. GET THIS GAME!

7939	1	a	Ridiculously realistic movement, aiming &amp; shooting. Ridiculously realistic representation of Lemnos &amp; S. Stratis.  It's worth buying it just for the choosing of these two Greek islands for a battle terrain...
7941	1	a	I love the Altis life game mod + This game looks so beautiful. And this game is much better then gta.
7943	1	a	I play this game everyday. Its amazing!

7957	1	a	Greatest GAME EVA!!! 
7959	1	a	Ive spent way too long playing this game, but i can say its the best game ive played. Playing this game has made 95% of my steam friends and that may be from mil-sim servers to life servers and survival servers. This game always has something for you to do. I 100% recomend it and also the DLC's as they just make the game even more fun! so see you in game!
7961	1	a	Love this game, firstly mechanics are wonderful! Graphics are amazing, and it is challening! First game I have played in a while where you can play and if you are new people help you out. I have put a lot of time into this game and some of the mods are amazing! But don't get me wrong. There are a few downsides. Sometimes can be hard to run if you have a not so good computer but overall I love it!   Love the bullet ballistics, simple and easy to learn. Love the teamwork involved in coop. People actually help eachother in stead of them running around with guns in their hands yelling'Allahu ackbar'. Brilliant community! Amazing mods!
7963	1	a	Arma 3, the game of the century. One of my all time favorites. Hell, it is my all time favorite. I have been gaming for most of my life, and have yet to find another game that I play or played as much as this one. I have been PC gaming since 2013 and started off with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead. I didn't get Arma 3 until about May of 2014. Then did I realize the immense amount the game has to offer. From racing go karts to fighting in Vietnam Arma 3 has brought everything to the table. Bohemia has done a great job but not recently when they haven't been able to find out a few problems such as the texture bug. I still do enjoy the game and all it has to offer and I really want to give it up to the creators of the mods and everything because it really pulls everything together in the world of Arma. That is just my two cents though.
7965	1	a	2,694 Hours Played Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  
7967	1	a	This is THE game to own. There's nothing else like it and the Community is great ! 10/10 from me easy
7969	1	a	Arma 3 is a very nice game,well developed and supported by creators from all around the world who keep making mods,missions and all that kind of stuffs that improve the quality of the game and increase its lifetime...sadly it's a bit bugged sometimes and it lacks some key features like jumping and climbing(which can be introduced by mods),but overall it's a good game and it's worth the money, and i can't wait to see how arma 4 will look like!!
7971	1	a	Arma 3 great game. Great graphics. But you need a great computer to run max settings at a decent FPS

8005	1	a	This was so much like irl I got PTSD  10/10 Would LIVE this game again
8007	1	a	I love this game, and after playing arma 2 this game was just a whole new world. This game might not have the same guns, which is a little bit of a let down but there are some new ones and many different mods to add the arma 2 guns back into the game. If you didn't like the stupid animations from arma 2 this game is alot better, like an actual reload animation, although it might be the same for about 10 guns or so nonetheless there is an animation. The DayZ universe has quite widened with the Exile and Epoch mods, new maps and other things, and honestly Arma 3 is the best arma made so far in terms of Realism. The leaning ability has also expanded, with a stance for shooting under cars, and one on your a$$ that looks like a dog scratching with worms. and many other things arma 2 could've used. Best $75 Ive ever spent, and I bought arma 2 for $6! If your fresh to the game series make sure you have a friend who can mentor your noobyness until you can become a pro arma-er, you will definetly need to especialy with Flying.
8009	1	a	I bought this game last year and wasn't expecting to get enough game time to get my monies worth. I have definitely done that and more. This game has so much potential and the amount of mods and different types of servers to play multiplayer on is numerous. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that I know that doesn't already have the game. Yes it's expensive but you will get your money back just in the amount of enjoyment and time you spend in this game.
8011	1	a	This game is actually pretty impresive. Real physics,life from a fighter, lets call it. Have you spended 60 $ on GTA V Because its fun? Try this one,it will be more greater and more funnier. Want to know why? Gta v is Rubbish. If youll buy Arma 3 you will never regret that you bought this game. And for Bohemia Interactive,Keep up the Good job that you done there. :)
8013	1	a	Fun with friends. 
8015	1	a	Yet another great game by Bohemia Interactive Studios. Keep up the good work!
8017	1	a	If you're looking for serious fun, you've come to the right place.

8035	1	a	One of the most epic games ever made. If you want a true simulator of a soldier - ARMA III is the way to go! I recommend it to every hardcore player there!
8037	1	a	I mean you get what you buy, it's arma, it runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the ai suck, the physics make no sence but it's glorious, ACE3 will make me continue to take math in highschool and i could never afford G3s or air frames in real life.
8039	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
8041	1	a	Its okay i guess
8043	1	a	the world's formost simulator in muslim killing technology you shoot sandies and blow stuff up, america style B)
8045	1	a	Is a good game. Nice People on the game. 10/10  
8047	1	a	This game is the best peice of junk ever. It has so many glitches and its so broken but no one gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because its so damn good.
8049	1	a	Continuing a fine tradition ARMA III brings realism in combat to the greatest level. Maps that are miles across with dynamic weather and day/night cycles (you can even navigate by the stars!), the best ballistics in the shooter gaming world, and every type of vehicle you can think of from tanks and helicopters to jet aircraft and small submarines, PLUS a powerful mission editor and decent AI gives you an unparalleled amount of content and replayability for your hard earned dollars!
8051	1	a	Just yes! If you loved ArmA 2 you're going to love this!
8053	1	a	My squad went into battle without pants but in full combat gear.
8055	1	a	Loved it, After the success of Cooking Mama and League of Legends the developer Activision shines down on us with the masterpiece that is this game (Gears of Halo Thef Auto 5) and with its staggering 69 dlc packs all priced at $4.20 you'd be a fool not to try this game out. Insomniac Games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.
8057	1	a	The most poorly-optimized PTSD simulator!!!
8059	1	a	  It's ARMA, what more do you expect?    Arma 3, the long awaited sequel to the outstanding Mil-Sim franchise by Bohemia Interactive.  This game is fantastc, theres no real other way to describe it. I have been a relative late comer to the Arma franchise starting with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead, though this third instalment certainly seems to fill the spaces with features that i had been longing for since playing its predecessor. Both modernised and revamped in both style, looks and gameplay; this game certainly plays smooth and looks amazing - i honestly struggle to find games as 'Open World' as this that look so beautiful at times.  The main draw of Arma 3 is certainly the online gameplay, new gamemodes such as Sector Control offer new light to the often dimming possibilities of such a 'complex' Mil-Sim game. Along with a consistant stream of community content flooding by much like Arma 2. Even the singleplayer campaign developed by Bohemia is absolutley brilliant if not at times frustrating.  However, it does indeed have it's draw backs. Having extensivley played its sequel you cannot help but feel like Arma 3 has 'something' missing. A little something that really does take away from the enjoyment of the game. The collection of weaponry feels at times limited and the distinct lack of certain features (Such as Bi-pods) have been completely overlooked and not implimented.  Despite this, Arma 3 is none the less a fantastic game well worth the purchase, and with the constant updates introducing new features - i'm sure it wont be long before all these little issues i have with the game are ironed out.    Recommended?:   Absolutley yes   Score:   8/10
8061	1	a	This game is hella good you can go from Helicopters, Jets, Boats, Submarines, Parachutes, On Foot... You can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you. You want too explore you can but...   You always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction, any height, any distance and from any type of challenge wether it's Planes Boats, Tanks, Mines, Enemies aka Troops and Paratroopers you name it..  You can also create Missions for you and your friends to play, you can also do anything set on your mind.. But you must follow Server Rules, if you don't want too be Kicked/Banned.   You can also do Solo Missions, the Campaign, Training ANYTHING! This game has a ton of Mods! So what are you waiting for BUY NOW!!
8063	1	a	Realy awesome game you should realy buy it!
8065	1	a	Verry good game and had great fun on king of the hill really recommend it if your into fighting and action games
8067	1	a	So immersive when played in multiplayer with a proper team. Map reading is just one of the real life skills you may need to use during battle, as well as using the radio and communicating with your team. Also includes a great editor to make your own missions for multiplayer and singleplayer, and you can upload your own missions to the Steam Workshop
8069	1	a	This game is addictive. Yet it has tons of bugs, it's fun. If you are concerned that you won't like it, try watching some Altis Life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on Summer or Christmas sale on steam. Now, lets get to what really matters. There are two sides to this game. There are the RP servers, and then there are the MilSims. The RP (RolePlay) servers are easy to get, it deals with Altis and turns your gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (Or enemies) with others. You can mug, kidnap, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (If you're experienced) other people. This gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of fun. If you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the Millitary Simulation Servers. There are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. This gamemode provides a damn good simulation of War on Altis. Ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. That's all, hope it helped! (By the way, I reccomend this game a lot, mostly for the people without large â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing anger issues.)
8071	1	a	It's ok -IGN
8073	1	a	Great game i just dont like the fact that bans carry over from game to game.
8075	1	a	This game got me pregnant
8077	1	a	This game has no good servers do not buy this game unless you want to wait for the one good server to open.
8079	1	a	If you want a really good war game and don't want autistic five year old yelling 'HARD SCOPER' or the game telling you 'You are leaving the Battlefield'
8081	1	a	Better graphics than real life
8083	1	a	Hey all you people, Hey all you people, Hey all you people, won't you listen to me? I just had a sandwich, No ordinary sandwich, A sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly... Hey, man! You've got to try this sandwich! It's no ordinary sandwich! It's the tastiest sandwich in the sea... Skee ba-da bob-a doob-a dob-a dab-a dee dow, Yeah!
8085	1	a	Great game for any military entusiast.
8087	1	a	Great game, one of the best all around modern day, military sim.
8089	1	a	This game... Is a rollercoaster.. There's parts you will really enjoy then there's parts you wont enjoy. This is a war simulator, not like any cod or bf game you would get. What it means is it involves a lot of running, traveling and it may require a lot of patience. It is almost 90 % traveling and what it does is it makes the 10 % worth it because when you have traveled or ran for a long long time then you wont really be prepered for combat too much. Even though its almost just a walking/running sim or just a waiting sim, when something really does happen you wont be prepered too much and that makes it really thrilling. Not only wont you be as prepered as if you had ran for 40 ft and then gotten shot at, killed them, ran another 40 ft and getting shot at. There's even a pretty good single player you can play for hours. The most popular thing i would assume is the multiplayer and that is because a the single player is mostly scripted and you can go through it over and over and know what to expect. While multiplayer is diffrent because you can walk somewhere, get killed one time, walk to the same place, get killed again then walk there again and not get killed. (Its not actually like that sometimes.) It's a game that has a BIG focus on strategy, teamwork and resourses.   Would i recommend this game? Yes. Thats just my formal opinion. This is a game you will most likely either love or hate. Before you decide get more into the game because its not just all of the same. It's one of those unike games you are likely to RARELY see.
8091	1	a	This game is DEFINITELY worth $50. I mean, who doesn't want to be a drug lord in Altis Life?
8093	1	a	 Tested the game during the free week-end on 2014.26.10   I have played Arma 2 and I am a fanatic of realistic military/tactical simulations, like the first Ghost Recons, Rainbox Six, America's Army, Insurgency, etc.  Note that right now I am at the  Tipping Point  mission, and I only played single player.  BTW I cannot finish the mission since I cannot for the life of me get into the speeboat. I can drown under it though. I also completed the entire tutorial which was very well made. +1 for this.  However the first impression of this game ain't good:  The 'simulation' part is very lacking .   Simulation? Nah... for real?
229	0	a	lol...I don't understand how it got such high reviews. people say mods make the game....well that's not the way it should be imo. If the game sucks without mods...well...it just sucks.   First 10 minutes of playing the game 2 major bugs. 1 invisible mobs..2 I got stuck going into the next campaign with no ammo for my weapons...I could not go to the ammo stockpile and do a damn thing about it...don't know why, don't care, done playing. Where are all these weapons they talk about? Maybe I didn't get far enough through the game but having only 2 or 3 guns to choose from was just boring...and damn the AI is badass...picking me off a mile away with a gun that in reality you couldn't hit a person with from 3 blocks away....absurd.  I don't know maybe the multiplayer is awesome....sounds like that's why people like it...single player? beh...save your cash imo.
230	0	a	I could not recommend this game even if I wanted to. Download is horrible, way too many gigs of space used for a game that is pretty choppy, decent graphics, and just a mess over all. The tutorial is fair enough, and the prologue is fine. But the campaign is horribly tedious and that's if you don't keep dying at it and having to respawn from autosave because they don't allow you to save for yourself after a certain point. Be prepared to die so many times your fingers will feel it. I'm glad to not be buying this and uninstalling it after I finish typing.
8095	1	a	This is a game where you shoot things and they die. Almost like real life. Except its not real life.
234	0	a	Pros:  - ....  Cons:  -Horrible. Constant crashing, -Cant play ANY mod at all when ALL I EVER WHANTED was to play Epoch , Battel Royal and Wasteland Chernarus. -60$ game + 30$ for 2 chopper ? ... -100 Gig (Arma 3 + few mod install )   Wish i have some good words to the game but i Cant get a single match to function and yes i watch youtube video and all but after 3 days i still unable to run any mod.   This game only remind me my experience on DayZ.Crash after crash and bug after bug.  I made a huge mistake buying DayZ and ARMA, I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.
235	0	a	Great idea, good controls etc...........but the bugs are horrific. Almost 2 years on and you can still die from clipping through walls, missions can't be completed, or the AI breaks is just not acceptable.
236	0	a	I wish i could both recommend and not recommend... but ultimately, i hate it.. it has such potential... if you like single player shooters, this game is pretty good. the campaign is pretty neat.. that's about it.. i got this game cause i prefer sims, over arcadey type games (CoD)... and the sim level is there... the problems start at online play. you need to be a member of a secret society, to actually get any war play going on online. and neither have the desire for that, nor the time or dedication.. this was evident almost immediately. all the online servers are really stupid GTA meets 2nd life meets the sims mod crap. its insanely stupid and boring.. unless you hunt down some online community of people who actually want to play a war game, you wont get that online from this game.. no official servers or official game modes (that i could find).. its highly annoying.. within an hour i wanted a refund, but at the time i had a baby, and he started crying and i left the game open, and it went past the 2 hour limit (5hours it claimed) i repeatedly email steam, trying to explain the situation, and all i got was the same auto response... a complete waste of money.. so i uninstalled... then with news stirring that it was going to get a dx12 update, i thought i would give another shot since i was stuck with this piece of crap anyway.. multiplayer is still absolute garbage if you don;t want to be active in a community.. so i played the campaign, it was ok till the second chapter, where the first mission is solo stealth with no guns garbage, and i lost interest again... up until that point, it was enjoyable.. about a 7 out of 10..   i dunno.. mixed emotions.. if you want to play a slower more boring versions of gta online with better physics.. this might be your game.. if you want to deal with online forums and locked private servers to get a battle in, this might be your game...if you like single player campaigns, might be your game.. if you like, single player target practice, might be your game.. it has all the potential in the world... with absolutely no delivery to anyone who just wants to hop into a battle and shoot.. (wasn't expecting a run and gun, but i was expecting to play a war game, not a run around grinding gold with stupid rules and having to have a job rpg) i would say avoid it.. i tried so hard to get a refund, but steam sucks, and i couldn't even get a real response from a human being.. now im stuck with this useless single player game.. i keep trying to force myself to find something fun to do with it, and it can't be done... on the other hand technically and graphically it;s amazing and the attention to details is great... it was just squandered on a community with terrible terrible terrible ideas on how it should be played... the addition of official servers wih official game modes, would make this game a 10 out of 10... until then, its like a 2.. unless you like pretending to be an under paid truck driver that gets harrasse by lame people who think they are digital police..  i personally wish i never spent a dime on this game...
8097	1	a	This game is amazing. While the campaign and 'vanilla' multiplayer are extremely fun, it's not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of gameplay.  The real experience comes with the mods, scripted game modes, and editor included within the game, or downloadable through various websites. What Bohemia Interactive has done is give those with a vision the incredibly powerful engine (and therefore a means) to create the amazing gamemodes you can download anywhere and play.

8101	1	a	Bananas are really nice.
8103	1	a	Best war game ever, its that simple.
8105	1	a	Played Altis Life. Started a gang known as the Notorious Paint Men. We terrorised the streets of Atlis Striking fear into those who sell paint by robbing them. We soon got investgated by the police and in order to save my friends and I, I proceeded to seduce the officer using Marvin Gaye's Let Get it On. It went well as he then restrained me and then strip searched me. Due to my guilt I was forced to tell the officer that I was the leader of the Paint Men. Fortunately I was able to escape his clutches. The crew then jumped out of the bushes and sprayed him down with there machine guns. In our escape i ran into a rock then got launched 500 meters into the air and fell to my death. 10/10 good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8107	1	a	Best war game ever, its that simple.
8109	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
8111	1	a	the realism thats put into this simulatour is amazing i enjoy playing constantly and always will. the msot enjoy aspect si the modding cmmunity so many great minds are putting their hard work into this game i enjoy testing and playing their content.
8113	1	a	What? Why are you reading the reviews? Why haven't you already purchased this yet?  ARMA 3 is the epitome of virtual tactical military-based operations and simulation. In my eyes, this game is not just a simulation of military firefighting and combat; I find this game is a great practice for team-based cooperation and initiative. You need to work together to complete your goal, follow your Team Leader to succeed.  There are many game modes that simplify the standard operations so new players will be able to experience the game in a friendly and forgiving environment that allows you to improve your abilities.  ARMA 3 is a grand game and I definitely recommend it.
8115	1	a	I eat â™¥â™¥â™¥
8117	1	a	GIVE ME A FRIENDS GIFT FOR THIS GAME PLEEEEASE 
8119	1	a	One of the better games (if not THE best) on my list in which you have complete and absolute freedom. The editor itself is a very fun feature and you can do practically whatever, as long as you dedicate some time to learning how to script or the syntax, or whatever. In any case, an amazing game which I truly enjoy playing with others co-operatively, but also PvP. The combat is fun, somewhat simple, but surely adrenaline-pumping and full of action. If you're playing with the right people, it's a relaxing, beautiful experience which helps team-building, teamwork, leadership and orientation quite a bit. The new features (stances) are amazing. Holding control and pressing w,a,s or d acts responsively and puts you into a certain stance.  The controls are easy to learn, flying isn't all that difficult if you have some patience and the nimble-ness to use auto-hover. Armoured vehicles (for now) contain only Armoured Personnel Carriers, but there'll be Main Battle Tanks soon, which is AMAZING. The names are altered, but you might recognize how the Zamak trucks are actually Kamaz trucks! (THE MORE YOU KNOW!)  Anyhow, the aircraft (helicopters for now!) are amazing and perform quite well. My favourite? I don't have one for now! But onto the weapons, which I find sauce.  Weapons are highly customizeable and allow for dynamic attachments and replacing the aforementioned. Stealth operation? Slam a suppressor on. Long-range? No problem, here's a scope. And it all goes together very well, but the content is still lacking. However, it's a beta and I can't wait for the actual release of the game (which will be amazing, as the beta is saucetastic as it is).  To anyone who wants to explore a mediterranean-esque island, I truly suggest purchasing this game and going crazy. As I said, you have a lot of options, the editor itself, you can craft campaigns in that thing. As stupid as it seems, it can be something better than singleplayer/multiplayer combined.   It's all down to you and how you wish to play it out. You could even try roleplay servers and be a civilian. But that's not what this is about. This is warfare.  10/10
8121	1	a	&gt;mfw i hit a small rock in a go-kart and die  11/10 GOTYAY.  But seriously, this game's a hell of a lot of fun. With friends. &lt;3
8123	1	a	As a reddit gold user, I've waded through dirt and mud (referring to dreaded REPOSTS, haha!) before so I know what to expect from a real life army man simulator. This was not what I was expecting. I was put in to a tight spot with my team, I couldn't even move, let alone adjust my fedora to tip at the lady members of our team! (Just kidding, there were none! Get in the kitchen! Haha!) and I even died once while I was distracted, looking at the funnybanana meme WHICH YES, I DID SAVE. THANKS JOHN! It's a great game, but I don't think I'll be playing it much when I get accepted in to the r/megalounge! Haha! Get me a whiskey on the rocks, autobutler! Haha! - Peter
242	0	a	it no work for me
243	0	a	Runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I want to recommend this but this game has been out for long enough and it still doesn't run well.
8125	1	a	You can shoot rabbits. 12341234/10
8127	1	a	Owned the game for 2 months and have never looked back... Great game
8129	1	a	Man This Game Is Amazing. The Physics In This Game Is Incredible If You Shoot Someone It Actually Shows Bullet Hole, If You Blow Up Building It Fall And Tumbles, On In-packed Of The Building Dust Bursts Out Like a Cloud.  Now Time To Mention Role-Play If Your a Person That Enjoys Role Playing i Recommend Joining The Role Play Servers.  Okay Time To Mention My Favourite Game mode Wastleland If Your a Person That Enjoys, Roaming Around Doing Missions Killing People Flying Jets Blowing Up Thing, Then Wasteland Is The Way To Go.  There Are Way More Game Modes Like Invade Annex, King Of The Hill And Even Exile But To Get Exile You WIll Need To Download it.  Over All This Game Is Fantastic If you Enjoy Any Of Those Things i Mentioned Above^ Then You Will Enjoy Arma 3 My Rating: 9/10
8131	1	a	Great graphics, realistic gameplay and i had a great experience with this game. Much better than any other shooting games like : Battlefield and Call Of Duty.  Succesfully made me fat. ._.  Recomended 10/10 -DatFpsPlayer
246	0	a	the campaign in this game is by far one of the absolute worst games i have ever played in my life, if not it is THE absolute worst game ever, horrible hit detection, cheap deaths, and terrible weapon sway make the campaign virtualy unplayable. I am a soldier in real life, not a reservist, a full time reg force soldier and with my experience in the army i can seriously tell you that this game is faaaaaaaaar from being realistic, i hate this game i cant beleive i spent 70 bucks on it it worth about 2 dollars in my opinion. dont buy this game you WILL be dissapointed.  LMFAO ive played every mode of this game now and its sooooooo broken its hilariouse i cant beleive this game sells and that people actually play it WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
247	0	a	Compared to Arma 2? This game is horrible. Now don't get me wrong, I love the hell out of Arma 2, a game which I've put more than 460 hours into. I've played everything from Wasteland, Takistan Life, Domination to DayZ. But this game...   Cons:  - The bugs. The desyncs. The clunky gameplay. One would think we'd have a smooth game after all these years, but no. It's the same clunky mechanics and awful netcode (expect those close combat 'But I just put an ENTIRE clip into that guy and he still killed me before I killed him!')  - The recoil mechanics aren't 'realistic', they are so bad that with many guns you simply empty entire magazines regardless of shot number (single or burts) and you will still miss. Where in Arma 2 at least the first shot will generally hit, the guns here are inaccurate as all hell which kills a large portion of the game for me,  - The stamina system is even worse, it runs out extremely fast and there's barely any indicator besides a faint darkening vignette around the edges of the screen to tell you that you're essentially â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed if you meet any adversaries. In Arma 2, you can hear your guy gasp for breath and your crosshairs fly all over the screen if you've tried to pull an Usain Bolt.   - Where in Arma 2 a single bullet can take you out, they seem to have appealed to the more mainstream gaming community and implemented some form of 'Oh look, Bob, I'm a bullet sponge.'    Pros:  - The graphics are amazing. Don't expect a well-oiled game experience to match.  - The intro story is good.   I will still not recommend this game. I've tried to play it and enjoy it, but it's a waste of money. But what am I saying? Go listen to those 'crashed car into pole 10/10 would do again' children.

250	0	a	Sorry but this game doesen't seem to be too friendly to new players. I just can't seem to get in to it. And i've tried it all including the milsim servers. I just don't understand the appeal. Most servers are very boring, OR way too intense, for a new player to feel comfortable. The mechanics are wonderful. But Arma seems like a very closed community. And that's ok. More power to ya, I know where I'm not welcome. I'll go play something else. Just wish I could get my $15 back. But hey, I tried. It's a beautiful game by the way, some of the best graphics I've ever seen.
251	0	a	so i want to play online however most need apex so im like ok lets see how much it is but i come to find out it cost a little less than the game its self.If you are looking to play online only get this if you are willing to buy both apex and the games its self and not to mention alot of the severs also need some of the other ones.
8133	1	a	Only played a few hours, still testing it but I would recommend this to anyone :)
8135	1	a	the morning after i had downloaded this game i procede to relive my life experences. id like to start off my life with telling everyone i had failed english every year till 8th grade, it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucked. so i was living my life and i decided to live my life like a man on xbox live likes to live to live my life to life long standards of living to exceding life goals set by people who are alive. once apon a time i was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a asian girl. so next time we meet on the avengers i decided to play arma 3. as i was held pinned down in a building i thought of my military training from my time in the military. so i proceded to out military the man in the military and proceded to win the war and saved america. did i mention was was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when i was 14? 10/10 would bang.
267	0	a	Well am an Arma 2 Veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am I sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the DEVS due to unknown reasons,lack of weapons,vehicles,maps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished.  I have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed I think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and DEVS themselfs making this just another generic OCD/ADD combat shooter.  It may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .
8137	1	a	War is hell.
8139	1	a	is good pls buy 
269	0	a	This game could be so much better if they fixed the ai. Was the same in arma 2 and unfortunately nothing has changed. Stealth is dead enemies will spot you in the dark 200 meters away or from a moving helicopter while your underwater. It is so inconsistant and really kills the immersion when concealment is moot.  Instead of enemies getting smarter on higher difficulties they just get aim bots. Got to the point where even sticking my head out of cover for a split second meant death from a distant machinegun headshot. Thats not more challenging its just cheap.  Best thing about this game is the editor.
270	0	a	This is the worst optimised game I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only does the frame rate stick around 25 and BELOW, but even when I put the graphics on LOW, Windowed 1024 x 768, it stays the same. Around 25 FPS. I have a great gaming rig and I just can not enjoy this game. Sometimes I joined a game and it stuck around 10fps. Don't waste your money
271	0	a	Never played an ARMA game, but I really liked BF2 Project reality and Early Tom Clancy FPS games. The pre-order was half of the future retail price and included Alpha and Beta access--so I thought I would give this a try. What I found was a half baked game that was overly reliant on expected croud sourcing assets. The game was bare bones with almost no missions, the engine was sub-par, controls not thought through, and gameplay generally uninspired.   If I'd bought a physical copy, I would be selling it right now.  Huge dissapointment. If you aren't already a fan of the franchise, you may want to pass or at least wait until it goes on sale for &lt;$10.
272	0	a	i love the game but i had to get a new computter and when i downloaded t to the new one it says ' GAME LAUNCH ERROR GAME EXECUTEABLE NOT FOUND. PLEASE RPAIR THE GAME THROUGH THE STEAM CLIENT.' i have done everything i could find and nothing works...this is BS and a wast of my money.....
273	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! For a $60 game, this is one of the buggiest games I have ever played. I'm talking about game breaking bugs too. The recent stamina update has completely ruined this game. You walk 2 feet and you're breathing harder than you would after finishing a 5 hour fap session, its horrendously stupid. It makes it impossible to aim down sights. DO NOT BUY ARMA 3
274	0	a	The Singleplayer CAN be fun. The graphics Options are pretty good, if you have a bad PC you can edit it very well. But Multiplayer is Very bad, i got the game for Multiplayer and its a Disaster, i cant even connect and when i join it says: Mission failed... I might be a noob. But i dont recommend the game.
275	0	a	No i won't recommend this game. I'm sorry but i'm spend more time trying to fix the game to get workshop scenarios to work because steam can't update a game properly and you have to redownload it again. Because every dev update breaks mods compatibilities, because mods get corrupted because steam is unstable, because mods gets corrupted when the game crash... I barely spend time playing the game too busy trying to get everything to work. What a farce.
276	0	a	I have only played this a half hour, but that half hour it has been horrible. It's nothing like a good shooter, in my opinion. I expected this to be like ... better.  This game really had alot of potential to me, and i do not recommend it at all. I simply hate this game.  Pros : - Good Graphics - Refunding  Cons : - You can get kicked for no reason - Bad AI - Nearly every server is Epoch (dayz) - Every other server is some weird mods as well  Please do not hate me, i just saw so much potential in this game. I'm sad they made this game like it is.
277	0	a	Terrible 1st impressions FPS is huge on almost every server if theres ppl its impossible to play because of the fps if the fps is low theres like 3 ppl on the server. Impossible to find a normal sever I get handcuffed for doing nothing and a lot of other boring â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND BUYING OR EVEN WASTING YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME
8141	1	a	It's Alright
284	0	a	Simple cannot recommend a game that, filles your screen with dlc adds if you happen to use something that is part of a dlc you as a user don't own.  I do NOT say that I want it for free, I rather it was disabled then having commercials that destroys my gameplay experience.   To simply annoy the consumer until they give you the money to get rid of the adds, is something I expect when trying a app on my mobile divices not when I spend 45â‚¬ on a high budget game.  Just because they give it for free doesn't mean they get away with it scoot free, aspecially when this wasn't part of the product when it launched.  (Sorry for any grammatical errors)
285	0	a	Arma 3 DLC the game
286	0	a	It took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything BIS is involved with. Yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot, but I bought a physical copy of the DELUXE EDITION from EB and as such i expected a FINISHED GAME, not the Alpha/Beta i was confronted with. It should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. And you would think DELUXE EDITION implies that at least *some* of the DLC would be included. Nope. Not so'DELUXE' then is it?  Imagine buying a new car, and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states 'Oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard, none of the dials or switches work. But as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee'. Seems a bit rude dosen't it? paying for something and realizing it dosen't even come close to expectations.   And the excuse 'why not just use mods' is just a sad way of admiting the game isn't finished and/or it isn't any good on its own. And even though i may pick it back up and try again i really don't see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a VERY bitter taste in my mouth.  YEARS Later............  2016 and it's still an unoptimized hot mess with the dubious choice of overpriced pointless DLC like go karts or constant ads to buy said DLC should you pick up or use the wrong item. And now most people would rather role play as 'cops and robbers' (d1ckhe@ds and dealers) than play the game as a mil sim. This isn't arma, it's the bloody sims with guns and as fun as that sounds, it is not. It's still a big 'nah i'll be right' to this game from me.
8143	1	a	Was playing battle royale and as the plane crashed into a city everyone screamed allahu akbar and other racist terrorist â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing
288	0	a	I ran a few different programs to give me a idea of what settings I could run it at and all of them told me ultra. Started it up and tried running it on ultra; couldn't even break 10FPS. I then worked my way down on settings, all combos and still didn't break 25-30 FPS. Tried looking up performance tweaks and still no improvement. The game itself could be great, but it can't seem to run on some high-end pcs so it was just a clossal waste of $ for me. It seems that 2yrs post-release that Bohemia would have resolved some if not all the performance issues by now....
289	0	a	UNREFINED AND JERKY -- describes every aspect of this game. Even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - I cant even hit a window on the side of a building. Bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. I wouldnt even call this and Alpha build and this game has been out for years -- NO EXCUSES AT THIS POINT. I want my money back, this game is garbage.
290	0	a	High price low fps, overall bad game
291	0	a	Performance sucks, gameplay is ok if you can find it, overall it sucks. Running simulator at its best.
292	0	a	Shot the floor only to have the bullet bounce from the ground and hit my friend in the head This feature is heavily overlooked But beacuse of this we arent friends anymore thanks Arma 3
293	0	a	Part of the appeal of this game is the realism (i.e. ballistics, stamina, environment), which positive reviewers rave about. The realism makes this the most exciting and action-packed pc game I've ever played. The majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides, then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself. How did the game know I have Parkinson's? You'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field, and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute. It's almost like playing tag with good friends, except for the part where someone gets tagged. I did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by, and I'm sure the AI experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another. Ironically, when well- hidden behind a tree or rock (or other random cover) and peek around the corner, the AI suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot. That'll teach me for trying to be tactical.  Save points are set within the game, and waypoints are even more predictable, leading to non-frustrating replays and non-existent monotony. There's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the AI has Xray and auto-aim, so that's a relief. Your squad will most likely make all the kills, and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you. Also, certain characters have infinite health so there's no real urgency in helping with firefights. Time to kick back and let everyone else have fun.  Then there's the weird controls, which will have you rolling on the floor (literally) out of cover right into incoming fire. That's the last thing the enemy expects! You'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers, only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface. I guess that's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute. As a plus, you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier.   I forgot to mention that you'll bleed out and die if you don't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body. That's actually pretty realistic, since it's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health. As you're wounded, aim and mobility decrease to the point that's so real you won't be able to contribute in any positive way, except to be cannon fodder for the enemy. It's ok though, when you die you'll get to respawn with full health. But then when you restart the checkpoint, you can't fire your gun because there's apparently a glitch in programming (or is it?) which doesn't allow reloading. This is great, since the game already saved your progress and you're stuck with one bullet you can't fire anyways. The realism is scary.   I would not recommend this game for $60, or even on sale for $30. I would wait till the price increases to at least $99.99, so that way you'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that's so realistic, you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience. Just make sure you're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete. Sorry, not illusion; simulation.
294	0	a	The game was released with very little content. Except for multiplayer it's not worth it, and even that is empty because of the lack of content they release the game with.  Good points would be the graphics, if your computer runs it ok. Even very powerful machines will have some issues with it. Community is great, modding is highly supported and the modding community is extremely active.  My conclusion would be to wait. Basically the game is in beta. The game WILL be amazing, however the state it's in now it's barren. Buy it when it's on sale, or in a year or so.
295	0	a	After playing this for a very long time I have come to the conclusion that the community has completely ruined this game.  This game is great and it has had a lot of attention put to it but the community is unbelievably stupid when it comes to gamemodes. There are only four gamemodes available in multiplayer and they're all flawed up the â™¥â™¥â™¥. ================================================= Gamemode 1: Survival (Zombies and Wasteland)  Zombie modes are boring and Wasteland is extremely boring. ================================================= Gamemode 2: King of the Hill  This is the closest thing you'll get to proper PVP action but the leveling system is beyond awful! Newer players are utterly crushed by higher level players who are all wearing ghillie suits, holding high powered sniper rifles and flying around in jets with unlimited missles.  New players are given a starter weapon which is totally useless and you don't get anything good until you reach level 13 which wouldn't be a problem if the leveling didn't take FOREVER! Then you have the massive problem with team stacking because players are given a big XP reward if they win the game, so they all stack on one team making it impossible for other teams to win.  Overall King of the Hills leveling and cash system is awful and the best way to beat it, is to camp in the cap zone until you reach level 13 but that will take you a good ten hours. ================================================= Gamemode 3: Roleplay  Its just like DarkRP in Garry's Mod except its super laggy to the point where its unplayable and the servers are all ran by teenagers with serious issues because they setup these convoluted Police recruitment systems, then they have there police force act like the KGB.  Overall Atlis Roleplay is a waste of time because of lag and an endless stream of trolls who do everything in there power to make the game unplayable. ================================================= Gamemode 4: Battle Royale  I hope you like waiting in spectate or waiting for the server to unlock. ================================================= OVERALL  Community: The community ruined this game with flawed and boring gamemodes. If you're looking for the real Arma experince you have to join a clan but clans are really strict, only play at set times and don't like people who are new to the Arma series.   Game: I could go on for hours about the awful bugs, UI, DLC and price of the DLC but instead I'm going to talk about serious connection problems and the System Requirements.  Connection Problems: Even if you find a server thats in your country and you have a ping of 20 you'll still lag like crazy making the already broken hitboxes even harder to hit.  System Requirements: Thankfully I have a super computer and I can run this game on Ultra settings but this game will go to war with your CPU and Graphics card!  I miss Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead because people used to play cooperative gamemodes like Insurgency...I miss Insurgency....It almost brings a tear to my eye.  EDIT: After searching for countless hours I finally found a co-op Arma mission people play called Annex, its pretty good but this game is still NOT worth your money!
296	0	a	More of an engine than an actual game.  Even if you disregard the absolutely horrid control scheme and terribly unoptimized engine as well as the stiff animations, One of the, if not The most complicated game ever to start playing.  It's impossible to just pick up and play. You have to download a gorillion mods and other tools that the community considers 'essential'. Once you do get into a game, expect 2 hours to fly by where you do nothing but walk around.  Some people swear by the game and have put hundreds, even thousands of hours into it. These people have my respect, as they have put aside enough time to allow the academic research that this game requires before it becomes fun. I just can't set aside that time.  
8145	1	a	1:Contact, Man. 400 Meters. East. 1:4, Target that, Man. 4: I've got him! 1: 5, Regroup. 1: 2, 3, 5. Board that vehicle. 2, 3, 5: Solid copy. 1: Forward, Fast, fast, left, right, STOP! 1: Fire! Cease Fire! Fire! Fire! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CEASE FIRE! Fire!  My ears are bleeding/10
309	0	a	So why is this still $59.99 USD? Stop being money hungry Bohemia Interactive please..
310	0	a	this games is really messed up and honesly if you are new to the game you have no idea what your are doing. once you find out the game becomes boring and long.  this game is onloy alive because of mods which also are a pain to install..  dont waste your time.  steam support &lt; request refund&lt; thx gaben got my money back for this crap
311	0	a	The best 30 FPS simulator I have ever played. Game is so good that user mods are better than the actual game. My personal favorite part about this game is the desync where you see people in tanks flying across the map raining down shells across the map.
312	0	a	The worse Arma ever - cannot connect and play co-op with a friend. Always get a response on game invite 'Server is not responding.' when trying to connect and play with a friend. They are just ripping off people by taking so much money for the poor quality. That's so devastating and sad. Do not spend your money on this game. Buy something which works instead.
313	0	a	NOT an AMD friendly engine!!   I have played this game since it first showed up on early access. I also had an Intel setup most of the time (2600, 3770K, and 4770K). It ran flawless with those CPU's (average FPS of about 70-80). I had to make a downgrade a few months back, and i went to a 6800K from AMD. Using the same GFX card, the CPU has become UNUSABLE for this game. Average FPS of about 17, and even lower in bigger towns. I know im not the only one, and i do know that this engine LOVES hyper threading. But you would think by now, it would have some sort of optimization of the AMD side of things.
314	0	a	Are you kidding me? I spend so much time trying to keep up with the AI's that I'm always so fatigued when we come into contact that I cant shoot? Half the time I cant even see them. Its either that or never get into a fire fight and spend the whole time running around a forest listening to panting sounds! Its utterly ridiculous. There's some great features and I would really like to play the game but at this point I'm so frustrated that I'm over it.
315	0	a	Bad performance it has.. Great graphics, it does. Recommend I do not.
8147	1	a	I have Autism and I recommend this game.
8149	1	a	ArmA III is a worthy successor to ArmA 2, taking the flaws of ArmA 2 and perfecting the game engine - mostly. There are still numerous bugs, AI problems, and much multiplayer FPS lag, but if you can get around these problems, this open-world sandbox military simulator is well worth the money.
8151	1	a	I am doing this to level up my steam profile.
8153	1	a	ARMA 3 is a great game with a moderate learning curve. If you liked ARMA 2 you will also like ARMA 3. Be warned, this is not your fast pace Battlefield 3/4 experience. ARMA 3 goes for a more realistic approach to the FPS game. This game has a great modding comunity and will keep you coming back for years to come.
8155	1	a	
8157	1	a	I really like this game it is so fun the editor mode is really fun to play around with making your own scenerios or just having a massive war for the hell of it so to the creators I say Arigato!
8159	1	a	Very good game. If you have played the Arma series before then you will know what you are in for. Lots of Mods and Missions to play online with friends. Also runs smooth on both my PC &amp; Laptop.
8161	1	a	very good i think yes :)
8163	1	a	I recommend this game, to all the FPS/SIM players!
8165	1	a	Good game with great mod's
8167	1	a	really good game with tons of mods
8169	1	a	great game
8171	1	a	This game is worth the buy. So many mods and looks so good. Just wait til a half off sale...
8173	1	a	A fantastic game which hold countless hours of gameplay and stories and funtimes :DDDD
8175	1	a	I disobeyed my 12 Year Old Commanders orders and mortared our supply station.
8177	1	a	Best game in the world, beautiful graphics...
8179	1	a	This is the future of war games.   All it needs now is interactive cockpits for the aircraft, tanks, and other vehicles but the modding community is superb.   There's bound to be something for you in Arma. It's not JUST war and guns and tanks and stuff...  You can go mountain climbing, scuba diving, skydiving, and even command your own battalion of... butterflies.
8181	1	a	Arrested for cooking meth  10/10
8183	1	a	great game to play with your friends
8185	1	a	Absolutely love this friggin game!
8187	1	a	best war simulation game ever
8189	1	a	Got together with some friends, decided that our lives were limited to picking cocaine. Nothing else in life was working. Girlfriends dumped us, failed out of school, in debt to the government. Now I am living the life, got ourselves some vehicles, a warehouse, started a gang and are now ruling the streets with a force. Enough so that now instead of just blasing 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Da Police,' we are literally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING them. 11/10
8191	1	a	This is The Best Game i've ever seen ! xD
8193	1	a	its best game na
8195	1	a	Arma 3 takes the best of the series and improves the infantry movement and animation system leaps forward. The game francise has had no competition in the market ( No there really is not competition from BF4 or codemasters tinkering called Operation Flashpint 2). Only other game that comes close is WW2 Online battleground europe. But that game is in respirator and waiting for the doctor to shut down the life support because horrid development decisions from dews.  Arma 3 is the best combined arms simulation in the market period. The mod community around the game is amazing. You really get tens or hundreds of games for the price of one. If you do not like the near future renamed vehicles there allready is heaps of current military gear and vehicles available. All the previous maps of the series are available free and working in the new engine. Main portion of the previous games vehicles are ported to Arma 3. You even have role playing servers up to hundreds of players per server if that is your thing.  The developer is allso leader of providing combined arms simulator to military. Virtual battlespace 3 (VBS3) is used by US and many NATO countries. Bohemia is committed to update the game and we saw firs major update to the helicopter physics with more complex flight models with rotor lib from Take on Helicopters simulation. And allso physics based slingloading and more to come.   Bullet pearsing and drop is calculated. day night cycle, acurate star map to navigate from if you forgot your compass in night mission. endles mission opportunitys in land, sea and air.  Its a solid 10/10 because no other game comes even close.
8197	1	a	My favorite Multiplayer Game, also bunch of various mods.
8199	1	a	Shooty shooty good, driving okay, flying hard. 10/10 bullets either tickle or are fired near you and you die.
8201	1	a	If you want to real reality you must play this game! It's wonderfull...
8203	1	a	Make arma not war! arma is the best military simulator out there! You will not believe the hours you can throw away at this game while playing the endless multiplayer servers such as life! - in which nothing can compete!!! Grab some friends and join a server, only then shal you understand! Brilliant. 9/10
8205	1	a	it is a cool game i like it =)
8207	1	a	Great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game
8209	1	a	Bohemiaâ€™s gone to immense effort to create real, immersive environments for Arma 3. Across two sprawling islands youâ€™ll find all kinds of terrain, from salt-flats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline. Even without a directed experience, just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience, letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places. Arma 3 is also that rare â€“ these days â€“ game that will push all but the most powerful PC hardware. It looks amazing even on older systems, but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions youâ€™re going to see performance loss.  
8211	1	a	Simply Best of its series so far.
8213	1	a	Loving this game, favorite game type to play is King of the Hill. Highly recommended!
8215	1	a	I have been looking for a game like ArmA 3 since I started with shooters. I always thought Call Of Duty, or Battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. This game is war. This simulator requires players to really try, it is not a run and gun game, you do that, you die. You need to be tactical, aware of your surrondings, and be prepared for anything, from a fireteam of men, to a sniper team, to tanks sitting on the hilll line. Everything about this game is amazing. Grapihc are awesome, if you can run them on normal or higher, the AI, and ragdolling could use some work. One con of this game is the AI, sometimes there smart, sometimes there dumb. They can get hit with a grenade at point blank range, break there legs, lay down and bandage, then get up and run away.    Over all, 20/10, would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.
8217	1	a	Best millitary game sim ever!
8219	1	a	make even less friends than in arma 2 since more people play it and they don't want you on the helecopters even if you promise you'll be nice
8221	1	a	After 400 hrs playing ARMA3 i find it exciting and challenging, the editor is another world on its own, then theres muitiplay a whole lot af different roleplay . From police ,dedic,rebel and even sell body parts . I give it a 10 as far as rpg go.
8223	1	a	I love this game. I transport drugs and sell this for money to buy more drugs :D
8225	1	a	with a 6+ years of gaming.   this is the best game i played hands down.  with a realistic gamepaly and everything.   there is some bugs here and there, but let me tell you even these bugs are fun and enjoyable.   i have over 1000 hours of playing this game and i still learn new things about it.  GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!
8227	1	a	I only play the multiplayer. Addictive and time consuming, but worth it. So many map and server style choices to choose from, its hard to stick to just one.
8229	1	a	Arma 3's features in comparison to the previous Arma is sustantial. NPCs no longer have extremely odd path finding patterns, and animations are much smoother. The recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother. NPC Dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more in-tone with the situation. Command voices for specific objectives run smoothly, and actually sound more pleasent. Bohemia Interactive really showed what they can do this time. 5/5
8231	1	a	promise not doing this for achievement.
8233	1	a	my lav got explode by a tente 10/10
8235	1	a	I have now been playing ARMA3 for a few weeks or months (Time flies when you're having fun) and it is one of my favourite purchases on Steam. I had ARAM2 and AO (then modded Dayz), so i figured, Why the hell not.  For the past 5-10 years i have been more so a fan of multi-player gaming over single-player, thought i thought to myself, i will try this one single first, mainly due to the fact i wanted to know how smooth it ran. Graphics up pretty much full, played it and had an average framerate more than 30FPS, so all is good. I have a little play of single player and start to pick it up. Game looks great. Few Km of open sandbox.Can't complain.  I try joining a server. Stratis Wasteland. 70 players, smaller map then the main one. (19.3km or something i think). Spawn in and streight away i head some explosions and firing. Luckily enough on my first go online, i managed to take out the two guys firing and loot a vehicle. Nice rifle and a nightstalker scope. I just sat in a bush, my sights scimming around and taking out the odd players 1 by 1. Night time comes, Change scope to thermals. Beautiful. Hiding up a hill, sat in a bush, with a thermal scope and another 2 clips if ammo to use. I felt how sadistic i had become. Beautiful.  This was just wasteland mode. However there are many other modes. Altis RP i would say is the most populated. A role play island where a player will need to gain licenses, buy weapons, vehicles. Basically it's what GTA online would be like. I reccomend picking up some scenarios from the workshop, such as Whole lotta altis and whole lotta stratis. as we as some of the mission generators.  If you're amazing at CoD. Don't expect to be amazing at this. This is a real game and does require a lot of skill and thought. No running in expecting to kill 30 in a row.
8237	1	a	Arma 2 customizability with a better engine, this game will be worth it's money through community made games alone
8239	1	a	I Strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good PC and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe Call of Duty and anyone that has previously owned a AmrA Game  
8241	1	a	I dont even own this game 22/10 its okay :IGN
8243	1	a	This game is one of the best games I have ever played. It beats CoD and Battlefield by a long shot. The only problem I have with this game is that it crashes alot on lap tops :( 
8245	1	a	best game ever made i give this game a 11/10  gamemodes that are the best  wasteland a badass action pvp war game mode  Altis life my personal fav. i have my own server wich is going amazing   patrol ops a realism task gamemode  all life gamemodes  so buy this game if you really want to have a great time and meet new ppl from around the world
8247	1	a	Wasted 200 hrs of my life  10/10  
8249	1	a	A crazy amount of single and multiplayer content just like arma 2 but way more responsive with some new welcome additions to the already immersive experience. If you like massive battlefields and as close to real life combat this is state of the art!
8251	1	a	Played 5 mins really good :)
8253	1	a	Great game, love it.  Problems with helicopters and its blades, might have been updated but still a great game (And car hitpoints are messed, so if you ram someone in the back your tires go =/ )
8255	1	a	Very nice and cool game!
8257	1	a	10/10 would arma 3 again
8259	1	a	The best ever! Arma Life is my favorite.
8261	1	a	Best game NA why you no buy you scrubarino? :D
8263	1	a	amazing game. probably my most favourite. worth every penny.
8265	1	a	10/10
8267	1	a	Realy nice game... a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game
8269	1	a	really good game !
8271	1	a	please give me back my time what I spend playing this excellent game :D
8273	1	a	Awesome Game. Would definitely reccomend
8275	1	a	Absolutely love it!
8277	1	a	The vanilla, unmodded game is honestly pretty awful. It is nothing like A2, where I could still play Vanilla for hours on end. ArmA 3 just feels weird compared to the games that came before it, and the lack of familiar weaponry because BIS was too cheap to buy the licenses is terrible.   On the other hand, throw some mods on, and play MilSim and you have one of the best games created. It is just a shame that weapons mods, vehicle mods and countless others are still required for good gameplay, when BIS could easily integrate them into the core game and do away with the need.
8279	1	a	Even though I only get 15 FPS in a city/town and 30 FPS in the countryside on this game, I still think it is one of the best games I have played. It still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like, a bit glitchy. Some of the good points are 290km map with no limits, its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign (well, thats what I think). Some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people. It can run pretty well on PC's without having a very good Graphics card. (I have a AMD Radeon 7730m 2GB graphics card and a i7 Core in a laptop and i can run the game!) This is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and I am glad I brought it.  9/10  If you like sort-of realistic first person shooters, then I would recomend you get this game.
8281	1	a	Relly happy with Arma 3. A very good game after Bohemias previous game, Arma 2. I like that you can do so much with this game. From WasteLand and King of the hill to Altis Life, but there is also more. You can use the workshop now, wich is a huge improvement from Arma 2.  Only bad thing in my opinion are the DLC,s. I really liked the DLC,s from Aram 2 but i wasn't really so happy when i bought the DLC Bundle for Arma 3.   First DLC: Some Karts no one really cared for, maybe a little bit fun on the Role-Playing servers but didn't matter a bit in the War scenarios.   Second DLC: Added TWO Helicopters. They were ofcourse pretty good, with one Hueron (Chinook) and one Taurus. But the bad thing is that this DLC costs around 13 euros. For TWO Helis!  Third DLC: Now this DLC is the good one though. The Last 'Marksman' DLC added alot of new weapons, such as snipers and LMG,s. I really liked these weapons and they are really good.  So for me this game earnes a 8/10  
8283	1	a	Fun, tactical interesting war simulator. Variety of online/singleplay gameplay!
8285	1	a	worst game
8287	1	a	10/10 would die to a nuke again
8289	1	a	Very clunky game, not fully optomized yet in my opinion. Requires a very high end PC and also requires DLC to play on most servers.
8291	1	a	I would recommend this game! But do not run any cheat programs for other games while yuo have this one. I was battleye banned for running a trainer for Wargame Red dragon. I always played this game with friends! Need a good pc to run this though. I played over 1000+ hours in this game until banned.
8293	1	a	Brilliant game 10/10
8295	1	a	Kids play Cod Boy play battlefield Men Play ARMA
8297	1	a	best game ever (y) worth money for this , i recommend to you guys buy this game :D
8299	1	a	Absolutley Brilliant Game!
8301	1	a	Arma 3 is fun if you have friends to play it with. plus thiers a wide vairity of mods such Breaking Point that can enhance your arma experiance. Buy it on sale and Have fun!
8303	1	a	Do you like fast playing games? Do you like simple games? Do you like games where you can kill everyone you see?  If you answered yes, than this is not the game for you!  This is a game for someone that wants to feel like he is in a real war. Here you don't shoot if you don't have to, you don't have action around every connor and you have to think through every your action.  BEST GAME EVER!!! (Just a little laggy for me so I don't play it anymore.... :(.... )
8305	1	a	Best game ive ever played.
8307	1	a	This game is awesome!!!
8309	1	a	Exceptional. 10/10  Pros: -Moddability -The game sounds amazing with mods (JSRS Dragonfyre, Blastcore Phoenix, TPW) -Much easier to play than ArmA 2 -Mobility and voice acting is much more fluid. You no longer walk like a tank. -The community (for ArmA 3 the way it was meant to be played, not the mods for it) is untarnished. -Simulator for many things. With further refining (mods), it could be a good armored combat/flight sim. -The game by itself looks absolutely gorgeous on ultra. The models are high-poly, the materials are great. With graphical mods (which aren't even needed), this game can unfathomably good, which is impressive for RV3. -Open world, multiple game modes and modifications available. -Mods give you ability to install maps instead of the CoD tactic of DLC map packs. -Zeus feature allows for dynamic scenario creation/multiplayer fun -Singleplayer content is massive. -Easy to create modifications -Combined arms modification is in depth and great.   Cons: -Unless you have a relatively top of the line computer, good luck running it on ultra. -Single thread usage is exceptionally poor with this game, much like ArmA 2 -DayZ community ruined the image of ArmA and its associates. -Children often play DayZ or Altis life or whatever have you. These kids go onto other servers (milsim/armored combat) and transfer the cancer of those communities to pure ArmA. -While bugs have been ironed out, many still do manifest themselves (often hilariously) -AI is still either really overpowered or really useless and dumb.  TLDR: get the game
8311	1	a	Good Game, Hours of fun and hilarious times in multiplayer
8313	1	a	Find server. Altis Life. Buy car. Call police. Allahu Akbar. Bans from server. 10/10 would do it again.
8315	1	a	best game. cause theres no other words to describe this.
8317	1	a	Great game!
8319	1	a	One of the best games in my library, do I have to explain myself, it's Arma!
8321	1	a	Great game and a must buy for in the summer sale!!
8323	1	a	Arma 3 is brilliant, but the Linux release of the game is still on v1.42, with the Windows release on v1.5, I cannot play on any multiplayer servers :/ 10/10 once they support updates to the Linux client
8325	1	a	The millatary experince gives intence awsomeness
8327	1	a	arma 3 is the best game i own must bye 
8329	1	a	This game is sick
8331	1	a	A very good simulation and game. So many things to! good buy if u like these sort of games!
8333	1	a	The best game on steam
8335	1	a	My favourite game so far! Looking forward to Arma 4 if thats gonna be a thing.. Hope it is!  Pure Awesome! 10/10 game - Teethed Goose studios
8337	1	a	Very good game has very good graphics and very good game play and very good shoot outs. I really recommend this game to everyone
8339	1	a	10/10
8341	1	a	'One. Engage that man. Half a klick.' 'Oh no. One is down. Fall back.' Has some fish A.I, too. 
8343	1	a	briefcase flung me in air n kill me 11/10 wud buy again
8345	1	a	Great game! Once your done with the single player there is an insane amount of mods and modes to play.   Some of the DLC is over priced or otherwise not worth buying.
8347	1	a	I had Arma 3 for ages before i got into it and discovered a gamemode i liked and i could have easily wrote a really bad review about it because i just found it confusing and didn`t know what to actually do. One day I decided to research the game a bit and once you find some gamemodes and servers you enjoy this game is amazing. The trick is deciding what to do with it because Arma has no pre defined style, it has so many gamemodes. Once you find something you enjoy it is one of the best games out there. Graphically it is a masterpiece and it runs like a dream on a half decent build but it is probably too intesive for lower end systems. I strongly suggest you do your research to ensure you can run Arma before you buy it. There is a huge and active community on this game and there so many different ways to have fun. You can even basically turn it into a flight simulator if you want to. My favorite gamemodes have been TDM and Altis Life but i know there are hundreds of other gamemodes to try and you are basically buying loads of games if you buy Arma. The maps are detailed and varied and most imporantly for certain gamemodes, large! Just to top it off there are even more downloadable ones. The game is well optimised and i originally came here from DayZ as Bohemia have never disappointed me yet. I 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing shooter that fills the hole left by shooters like CoD and Battlefield that have sadly gone south in my opinion. This game is fun to play alone but even better with friends. Well worth the money and definitely deserves a place in your steam library!
8349	1	a	Its grate
8351	1	a	This game has taken away hours of my life. I hate my life so this game is great. 10/10
318	0	a	Didn't even launch multiplayer once, and I am banned. Battleye - The Anticheat Gold Standard
8353	1	a	Easily the most fun game I have ever played. Hands down. There is literally nothing you can't do with this game. Wanna play stock? OK. Like Zombies? Theres a MOD for that. Wanna make your own missions? There a MOD for that. More weapons? MOD. Like other people? Multiplayer. Hate other people? Solo. Wanna RP? There are servers for that.   Damn, this game just has everything!
8355	1	a	This Game is probably the best game ive ever owned and yes i have low hours cuse this is my second account, I have about 700+ hours total! but i gotta say if youre pc isent good youre gonna have a predy bad time :,(
320	0	a	you know the funny thing is, This game is becoming a money horder. Apex is 34 Dollars. Orignal game is 40 Dollars. Apex isent half of the game... Yet it is more than half of the price. *Facepalm* Dont reccomend buying this OR Apex till a sale...
8357	1	a	Arma 3 Best, Military Simulation
8359	1	a	Seems good so far.  jk, best game ever. Defenetly worth buying. 11/10!
8361	1	a	great game
8363	1	a	COOL BUT APEX IS TOO EXPENSIVE!(
321	0	a	Arma 3 is an awesome game! Players are young self serving short fused millenials but its still A must buy! but dont speak your mind on chat or you will be phantomly banned by men with no boezack to tell you there thoughts b4 doing so. there will be 5000000000000 servers but only 3 to join since latency sucks and everyone is a sheeple and plays some life role play mod garbage. i have 25mb a sec consistant download speeds and run it on minimal settings so internet and graphics is not the issue. so be wary of the bans is all i can say since there is no forgive policy on any server that i know. Dont be as mad as i am right now when ur banned for not installing some garbage communication software the admins want you to download from 3rd party insecure site! or for not lining up with the rest of the tools with no life on 1 of you 3 possible servers your able to play the vannilla game in! Happy Gaming :)
8365	1	a	10/10 would 9/11 again!
8367	1	a	Hard to run, fun to play.
8369	1	a	bug free
8371	1	a	&gt;Buy game &gt;Play Altis Life RPG &gt;Buy Car &gt;Buy Gun &gt;Park at the front of the PD' &gt;Oink rapidly &gt;Get chased &gt;Pull over &gt;Get tased &gt;Picking up soap for 5-10mins  I play most the game modes, the modding on this game is great. If you have good interwebs buy this game.
8373	1	a	If you enjoy a immersive experience you will enjoy arma 3. Whether you are traveling thew Nam hoping there is no one hiding in a bush or you are traveling threw altis hoping not to be robbed by a creeping terrorist. If its your forte you will be evading police in the city of lakeside transporting your thousands of pounds of meth back and forth from your lab to your drug dealer. There is a mod or server for every person who is apart of the PC master race.
324	0	a	Banned from battleye for no reason DONT BUY THIS GAME U GONNA WASTE YOUR MONEY
8375	1	a	Season pass = No Apex
8377	1	a	-Logs into Arma  -Goes on Altis Life  -Speeds and gets pulled over  -cop asks 'why were you speeding'?  -Replies 'Cuz i couldn't wait to see you' ;)   10/10 would speed again
8379	1	a	)))
8381	1	a	One of the best games i ever played! The optimization is really bad, but still enjoyable
8383	1	a	Best Game ever. If you're looking for a realistic shooter come here.
8385	1	a	Great game.
8387	1	a	The ten step guide to play Arma 3 Step 1: Start up game Step 2: Pick Loadout Step 3: Find vehicle Step 4: Take twenty minutes to drive to objective. Step 5: Arrive at objective. Step 6: Get killed a minute later. Step 7: Repeat step 3 - 6 Step 8: Repeat Step 7 another six or so times Step 9: Repeat steps 3-5 before you realise that the objective has been completed. Step 10: Repeat Steps 3 - 9 and soon enough you might actually achieve something in this game.
8389	1	a	Arma 3 is a very immensely amusing game. I mainly play Altis life and i have got to say it has the best graphics ive ever seen in a game, it almost look like a on-going movie. Arma 3 is a military Training Simulation (Milsim). Anyone who liked Arma 2 will like this and anyone who haven't played Arma 2 will like this, and yes, that wasn't a typing error. I would most definitely recommend this game to someone who don't currently have the game because it is really realistic where there would be realistic actions that need to be taken. I have also persuaded a couple of my mates to get it.  But... There is once downfall of this game, You need a high-end computer to handle it, which is ok for me but might not be ok for someone who wants the game but has a Mid or Low end computer. And yes if you want to run this game off a Laptop, then you will need a very expensive on that can handle it.  All in all, i would recommend this to anyone that own or have a high-end computer.
8391	1	a	Where to start,  Firstly, it is highly recommended you aquire a chunky PC before tempting to play this game, it has bad optimized servers and has had since release, Secondly, this game is for the quite experienced players such as myself, not boasting at all, it takes some time to get into the game and also to get use to the controls as there is ALOT of keys which are used. Finally, i highly recommed this game due to its character customization and aswell as the combat movement, its very realistic when it comes to that until you see the damaging its quite weak with the weaponary, other than that this game is very well made just needs some more tweaking to make it what it is seen to be.  Rating: 9.8/10
8393	1	a	Famous last words: 'Is that a grena-'
8395	1	a	prety col game
8397	1	a	Played a little, was OK...
8399	1	a	Flying boats and many glitches i give it 9/11 Allahu akbar
8401	1	a	Arma 3 is like anal, Hard and painful, but you'll get used to it.
8403	1	a	Sniped a copilot at 1000m then was lining up a shot to kill the pilot, got kicked for inactivity.  Best experience 10/10 would get kicked again.
8405	1	a	Got kidnapped he told me to lick his balls i did he gabe me a gun out of trust he killed me in a gun fight 10/10
8407	1	a	It's ok.
8409	1	a	Travis Scott's newest album really dosn't stay true to his original style and has more of a Hip-Pop feel than Hip-Hop
8411	1	a	Awesome multiplayer action. This team-work based game is incredibly immersive and makes you feel like a real soldier. With tons of weapons and vehicles to use and take out your enemy, this game is definitely worth the money. It's like Arma 2 but less buggy and so much more enjoyable!
8413	1	a	Arma 3, an exelent military simulator, i recommend to anybody who likes the military.
8415	1	a	Grate game for teamwork!!
8417	1	a	Killed by puhed the car 10/10 The best game ever+Best texture . Buy it !!!!!
8419	1	a	Very moddable, lots of workshop content it really brings this game alive!
328	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ terribly unoptimised like 20 fps with gtx970
8421	1	a	This game is the worst game i have ever played, i had the game and it uninstalled itself and then took 4 months to download ( totally not my wifi) and it is very annoyinh having to download all of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING mods, so over all 10/10, great game, must buy.
8423	1	a	If like simulation military ganes this one is for you you can fly a jet thru a wall and not die you can also get shot by a rocket dierectly in the chest and not die BEST SIM GAME EVER 
8425	1	a	run in arma die in arma repeat  9/10 game needs to add gambling
8427	1	a	so uh. a3 right? you have a good computer? aight. you have some patience? aight. get the game and download 25 gb and then download another 5~10 gb to play exile. play exile - find a way to force yourself through wooden and steel walls and eventually cause a major update in exile. play exile more - find a way to make yourself invisible and kill the entire server from 5000+ meters away because youre sitting in the back of a lada on everyone elses screen, eventually cause a major update to exile. play exile even more - find a way to make mad money by duplicating literally 20,000 weapon supressors, and sell them using an autoclicker and your amazing skill at being afk. the autoclicker crashes the server and kicks everyone (but you). the server goes down for 5 days - causes another major exile update.  in my time playing a3 + exile i feel like ive helped the community a lot by breaking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. youre welcome.
8429	1	a	1650+ hours and I still fall in love with Arma 3 all over again when I play a well executed mission.
8431	1	a	Really fun. Much better with friends. 9/10
8433	1	a	By far one of the best games i think i have played :D would recommend!
329	0	a	It's a great game. It looks beautiful.   But I can't use a sniper rifle unless I pay another 12 dollars.  Helicopters? 12 dollars.  Apex? 35 more dollars there.   I like the game but I wanted to be a sniper, and I hate being nickled and dimed.  If you got the money and don't mind that, get it.   I however, mind.    
330	0	a	Despite the great eye for detail, the animated character and the beautiful landscape, this game definately does not earn a 'thumbs up'. The main reason for this is because the game is full of crashes. This evening is as one of the many others where I wanted to join arma but I couldn't, all I did was just scavenge the weirdest websites in order to find ways to get around the crashes that I stumble upon while joining servers. I am at the point of thinking Bohemia doesn't even care about how well arma 3 runs anymore: even on high-end game pc's fps never reaches higher than 50 in cities, it keeps on crashing and there is a lot of other weird stuff such as sudden deaths due to rocks in-game or hostile stairs while walking over them.  I love to play the game, but the game just won't let me. -1
8435	1	a	FT-2: Fight For The Territory PLAYERUNKNOWNâ€™s Battle Royale ........... i go to continue to explore great experience of arma!
8437	1	a	Let's see where I can go with this review.  My overall rating: 8.0  Individual ratings:  Gameplay: 7.0 Graphics: 9.5 Single player: 7.0 Multiplayer: 8.5  Okay, so let's start with gameplay.  The gameplay of this game is great. Although the game could use more vehicles, the game itself feels modern, realistic and immersive. You can have a handful of scenarios to test your skills in, or you can jump into user made missions. Both which do the job well. Although the former is limited, the latter is not and there can be a large number of missions available on the workshop for you to enjoy.  The weapons and vehicles feel great to handle when using peripherals such as wheels or flight sticks, and the HUD is easy on the eyes. It looks very neat, so information is organized nicely. You can adjust this to your liking too. No HUD? No problem.  'So, why did you rate this 7.0 if you liked it so much?'  One thing spoils this game - frame rate issues. No matter how I play the game, the frame rate drops frequently and can be very annoying. I've tried everything to get it to work, but nothing changes. Once this is fixed, this will jump up to 8.5. Only other suggestions are minor improvements such as a larger variety of controls for vehicles and fixing the free camera.  Graphics are next and when I maxed out the settings, the game looked beautiful. The models were smooth, the textures were sharp. There wasn't many graphics glitches and you could control the graphics in a variety of ways. I like this a lot. I think the planes should have a larger variety of camouflages, but that's about it. I already mentioned how the HUD looks clean, so I won't mention that again. The environmental effects look nice too, such as rain and night. This is my favourite part about Arma games; although the gameplay is nice, the graphics draw me in more. It's a cool touch.  Single player: A lot of workshop mods as well as a good variety of base missions. Nothing to dislike. However, campaigns shouldn't be dependant on DLC. I don't know about you, but I think the Apex DLC is overpriced. That's my opinion though. VR, or Virtual Reality (a mode in Arma where you can test out weapons and vehicles) is cool too, good for comparing weapons.  Multiplayer: if you don't find yourself in a game full of trolls and team killers, the game can be very co operative. Domination servers are my favourite because it's good to have to adapt to different scenarios. For example, taking out AA, CAS comes in, enemy reinforcements come in so you need to hit a radio tower to stop reinforcements. Things like that. Great with friends too. However, I've had some bad experiences with some ARMA admins (I got banned permanently because I was apparently cheating, all I did was run from a truck to the BLUFOR base) but this shouldn't put you off the other servers where admins are decent.
8439	1	a	I bought the game and all the DLC for $80 My game crashes ten minutes after I join a server.   Best ten minutes of my life   10/10 
8441	1	a	Amazing game with so many different ways to play.  You can be a part of a tactical realism squad.  You can just play king of the hill for fast paced action.  There are lots of mods that you can play like battle royale and breaking point.  Only bad point is the multiplayer can run badly.
8443	1	a	Perfect game 5/7
8445	1	a	This game is just amazing, so much content for the price. Definitely worth the buy :P
334	0	a	The game is absolute garbage. I thought it would be fun, I guess not. Stick with Arma 2: Operation Arrow Head if you want better experience!
8447	1	a	You can shoot fish while scuba diving. 11/10 Best Call of Duty
8449	1	a	I was all like, hey â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me right my PC can run this. Apparently it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing can't and i can barely squeeze out 25 fps in towns, which infact makes it way more cinematic so thats good. Hey, i mean keep being autistic on RP servers tho, thats actually all you can do in this game.
8451	1	a	This game is a must get for milltary shooter lovers. There is an editor and can even get mods for it like Garys mod. This is great and I think that anyone can use this game. Also great story.
337	0	a	Don't buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   The campaign is still bugged, years after the game got out. Too many bugs and just annoying little things to be bothered playing it through. There is still a bug in place that prevents you from entering a boat and thus advancing with the campaign. The NPCs are often slow and hinder your progress. I found myself waiting for 15 minutes just for the idiots to catch up with me. I've restarted missions at least 5 times because some events just wouldn't trigger, making me stuck.  The optimization is a joke. It's laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Especially in multiplayer, where changing your settings doesn't mean jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because the server bottlenecks the fps (??!!).  You're basically forced to buy the DLCs. Most of the servers have DLC guns which you can't use unless you buy the said DLC, which makes the game kinda pay to win. Being forced to buy DLCs when you've already paid the full price is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing disgrace. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Bohemia
8453	1	a	  love the game such realism
8455	1	a	Russian tested, Putin approved. Needs more Russian mods though.

8467	1	a	This game will make you lick your own lobster!
8469	1	a	Arma 3 tons of mods, good servers, great campaign THis is War!
8471	1	a	Very nice military simulator. Very realistic for people who enjoy that type of game. For fast past gamers I would no recomended this game for you as it is very a very slow.
8473	1	a	I absolutely love Arma 3 and would in every way recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest. There are somewhat valid criticisms of it which I will get out of the way right away, before getting into why the pros by far outweigh the cons. 1. Lack of Content - One of the more popular criticisms of this game is the lack of official content in the current build, especially compared to the amount of content in Arma 2. The two main factions currently (at the time of writing this review) have no fixed wing aircraft, armoured vehicles of different factions have the same turrets and weapons merely reskinned (artillery, anti-air and remote controlled turrets on smaller vehicles) and UAVs/UGVs are identical for all factions except for different camo patterns. 2. Performance - Another often heard criticism of Arma 3 is that it performs very poorly on some machines that it often should perform well on. Like machines with top-end graphics cards and powerful CPUs.  Addressing these points one by one, I will say that while there is content missing that even I would have expected the game to have at release, it isn't a whole lot. Arma 2 did not have all the content it does today at it's release either, and much of it is inflated by there being separate entries for guns with different attachment combinations, so that the same gun with four different sight attachments would show up in a list as four different guns. As for the performance issues, the game runs perfectly fine on my middle-of-the-road gaming rig and runs at playable rates on the old low to mid-end machine of my best friend. The performance of the game on some people's high-end machines is in no way a sure indicator of bad optimization, especially when the same game runs great on other machines with the same hardware.  Now getting to the real meat of the review. The visuals of this game are amazing, especially if you have the power to crank up the graphics settings. The lighting is great and makes the game look heavenly, especially at night. The texture quality is top notch, especially for foliage and I fully believe anyone interested in first person shooters, should experience one where you can freely roam a huge 270 square kilometer beautifully rendered island with a rendering distance of several kilometers. Other cool graphical features are the volumetric fog and clouds as well as rain that is rendered as independent particle effects for each raindrop in stead of a mere filter or overlay.  Audio-wise the game could do with some improvements that are guaranteed to happen over time, if not by Bohemia Interactive, then by community modders, however overall the sound design of this game is really quite good as it is.  The gameplay is where Arma 3 really shines over it's predecessor, as controls of your soldier have been improved to feel a lot more direct and fluid than in previous games, though the action menu still tends to limits how good the game can feel in certain situations. The inventory system has seen huge improvements from Arma 2 and is much more streamlined, without sacrificing flexibility. Vehicles are now physics simulated objects, which is a huge improvement over Arma 2's incredibly janky vehicle physics. Underwater gameplay is a really nice addition that looks amazing and gives mission makers a lot more freedom and variety to work with, when making missions and giving the players different approaches to completing them. Firing weapons in Arma 3 feel pretty damn good as most rifles have a good deal of kick to them, making them both sound AND feel powerful in stead of feeling like Call of Duty or Battlefield style bullet-hoses. Different weapon calibers penetrating diferent materials differently at different angles and distances gives both the shooters and the people being shot at a lot of things to think about and decide how to react to in every firefight, which is great in a game that is so decidedly slow paced as Arma is, compared to other first person shooters.  If you get this game and want to dive straight into some fun Arma 3 gameplay, I suggest playing though the first episode of the single-player campaign first, to get acquainted with the fairly complex controls and spotting/shooting enemies at ranges that other FPS games would never expect you to. Once you feel somewhat at home in the game, I highly recommend looking for a multiplayer server running the Wasteland mission, which is sort of like a 3-way Team Deathmatch gamemode with survival elements, base-building, resource gathering and impromptu mini-missions against AI that all of the three teams are given and can undertake at the same time, each team trying to beat the others for the promised reward, leading to some very interesting clashes.  So all in all, I can barely recommend this game enough, but to get some real enjoyment out of it, you'll want to run it on a decent mid to high-end rig.
8475	1	a	TL;DR:  Easily the most realistic military game I've played. Definitely much better than the previous games. It's best to wait for a sale, however.   Pros:  -Very strong creation engine -Notable Mods/Community -Descent Graphics -Very realistic bullet physics/aiming -Strong campaign  Cons:  -Not the most optimized game ever -Slow-paced (but that's to be expected) -Sub-par infantry animations -A few notable bugs (especially in the AI)  9/10 Overall
8477	1	a	I Think it's ok
8479	1	a	Another rip-off of all of the popular good games, such as FNaF, Minecraft, Garry's Mod and Pokemon Go.  In Arma, you play as a man or a woman, which is strike one of this game since there are NO OTHER GENDERS TO PLAY!!!!! What you do in this game is shoot and survive, as well and try to eventually get to the end of the campaign, which is the same thing you do in Minecraft. There is even crafting if you get mods! This game wants to be like Minecraft!  Five Nights at Freddy's comes in at night time. You walk around trying to avoid other harmful cisgenders, or sit in your base (like in FNaF) and try not to die. This is a carbon copy of FNaF at night time, yet it costs twice if not thrice as much.  Then there's Garry's Mod RP when you play a mode called Altis Life. IT'S THE SAME THING! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE GRAPHICS, AND IT'S WORSE THAN DARKRP! You have to grind for hours just to get a gun license, and when you get the gun you are shot down by police for being black and have to start all over again.  And finally, it also copies pokemon go. In a mode called Wasteland, you walk around on your map trying to collect different vehicles to harm other cis-gender scum, but there are WasteStops, or as they call it in game, 'shops', for you to get the appropriate gear as to set out to find the vehicles. or you can just purchase them, which I think is a Pay2Win aspect and that's why Pokemon Go is better.  In conclusion, this game tries to be what it shouldn't in order to make money.  10/10 game is good
8481	1	a	Smoke heroin, sniff weed, inject cocaine and worship Satan.. Oh, and Arma is awesome despite the low fps... just don't come with a ''BF or CoD mentality'' here, this is the real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
8483	1	a	10/10 would have a terrorist attack in the general store again.
8485	1	a	this game is the best army/war game i have Ever Played id say its better and more immersive then any other army/war game that i have seen. if you like atkeast 15hr of gameplay in a game that you can play with friends and team up with other players and fight other player this is a game for you there are rp servers and survival servers aswell and teamdeath match but i dont like that but none the less if you like spending hours in a game with friends roleplaying in games get this one because you wont regret it trust me I LOVE IT      oh yeah this is the longest review i have done
8487	1	a	  very good game, play it a lot. certain you do not have this game I recommend this game a lot. ;)  
8489	1	a	A great first-person shooter that's been around for a while now, but has been kept fresh thanks to the DLC and the mod community. There's a lot of love gone into this series, especially with the Tanoa map. It simply is a beautiful map to play. The only issue with this game is the resources the engine uses. It's infamous for sapping CPU cycles. But there's lots of help on the forums with assisting you tweak the game to provide the best FPS possible.  If you're wanting support for this game however, it is best to use Steam's community Arma 3 forum, as the official BI Arma 3 forum is now run by some (not all) overzealous moderators who move, delete and lock threads for no real reason other than they're not adhereing to whatever it is they believe is 'their' interpretation of the rules. In short, if the mods don't agree with or like your post, they'll move, delete or lock it.    
8491	1	a	&gt;Plays offline 3 hours. &gt;Decides it's enough. Goes multiplayer. &gt;Buys a car &gt;Teleported by a hacker in a strange place. &gt;Gets a parachute from a guy.  &gt;The parachute was actually stolen. &gt;Gets shooted by the guy. Best game. 10/10 would stole parachute again.
8493	1	a	Best game ever!!! Cannot wait for Arma 4.
8495	1	a	Hard controls 100000000000000/10 real life so good for friends this game is so niceeeeeeeeeeeee ho buy this game is so good
8497	1	a	Its ok
8499	1	a	1. Bought Arma 3 2. Joined Altis Server 3. Got robbed twice by the same guys when was on the way from apple fields. 4. Joined to them as a bait 5. Proven my self, got a gun. 6. Called police 7. Get them arrested 8. Profit. mlg  Would collect apples again. 11/1
8501	1	a	sooo much fun... u have to get this. and then fact they are adding mods. OMG
8503	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
8505	1	a	WAGWAN BLUD DIS GAME BE BARE TRIM LIKE THAT INNIT
343	0	a	Oh, so you are soldier ready for some action ? Avid sniper ready to take souls of your enemies from kilometer away ? Helicopter pilot inbound to support your troops ? Nope, you have to buy DLC for that, an overpriced one.   Bloody Bohemia, you own best milsim franchise out there, one of the most popular survival games, and you are telling me I need to support you with these DLCs which are just basic content ripped of game. Don't take the path of Ubisoft or EA, you can do better. I think 45â‚¬ is more than enough for full content of game.  Game 10/10 DLCs ripoff 0/10  Get your margeting together.
8507	1	a	Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.
8509	1	a	Was driving around with a friend in a car. Drove off a small hill, and proceded to stop moving. Asked why we had stopped moving. Friend answered: 'We appear to have lost a tire'  Walked 5km to the next objective.  10/10 would lose tire and walk to objective again.
8511	1	a	Simply Amazing.  After playing arma 1, arma 2, arma 3 is by far the best.  Guess what?, iv never tried the mulitplayer, also guess what?, iv never even attempted to try the single player...  All 350 hours iv spent on this has been on the Editor, making missions, huge battles, base attacks, its just great.  But i have to say, this game wouldn't be what it is, without the Modding community too, Mods are essential.  The only downfall i found with arma 3 is that its set in 2035 i think?, the future weapons are very tacky, nothing beats a good old AK47 show down   So because of the whole future thing, i rate it 9/10
8513	1	a	Arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a 'war simulator' overall. It is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. The games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. I find this single feature what makes Arma stand out the best. More shooters should have the level of control Arma 3 gives players. There were a few 'cons' to all of its 'pros' though, so I will list my biggest as follows.   1. Multiplayer Servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your FPS (frames per second)   2. I feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players.   3. Better single player. Arma may be best for its multiplayer but I think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable.   All in all I think Arma 3 does the 'shooter/ war simulation' best, it may not be as popular as games like COD or Battlefield but thats not a bad thing. Imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those 'guys'...
8515	1	a	Best game, played it a lot.
8517	1	a	10/10 -Im Hillary Clinton and I approve of this message.
8519	1	a	This ia an amazing game. Even for 60$. As it shows I have about 700 hours, and some of my friends have even more. Anyone that says they don't like Arma is lying
8521	1	a	Arma 3 Is a Game like no other, Bohemia Interactive is a one of a kind company aswell! They Treat their Customers with Respect they listen to their fanbase and They dont rip us off infact they let us rip them off lol! But the Arma Series Is amazing And Arma 3 the latest installment is No Acception when Compared to Arma 2 Or Arma 1 This game is just amazing anyone that is looking for a Hardcore Military Simulator Based on the future of warfare (2035ish) The core game is Perfect for you! But since Bohemia Interactive and this games Fanbase are amazing you have thousands of mods at your disposale Arma 2 Combined Operations ( Last Arma with DLC Operation Arrowhead) had mods witch enabled you to expierence the games simulation in WW2 Battles or Vietnamn or the ever now popular DAYZ (Zombie Appoycolypse Survival Simulator pretty much lol) But the mods and the game Give you 100% Freedom to do what you want where you want when you want!
8523	1	a	The best and biggest milsim sandbox out there. If you're a fan of PC gaming, this should be in your library.
8525	1	a	&gt; Buy Arma3 after playing 2 &gt; Seems alright &gt; Spend 800 hours in milsim &gt; Play on milsim server as per usual one night &gt; Next morning go to school &gt; Kid drops book on ground and makes the classic *SNAP* noise &gt; Had to stop myself from dropping to the floor behind a desk and yell: 'Where is it coming from?!?!' &gt; 10/10 would PTSD again
8527	1	a	Beautifull game  But my PC is piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. and there for everything must run on Standard During Online gameplay.
8529	1	a	This right here, this is not a game. This, Arma 3, is an EXPERIENCE!
8531	1	a	Most fun military game ever so many ways to play arma 3
8533	1	a	Arma 3 is like its predecessors. When Bohemia launched it (I mean after Alpha and Beta Phase) it was still incomplete, lacking content (for example: I mean the biggest Island ever and only one Jet for a minor Fraction the AAF) and Bug riddled. So nothing changed, Behemia is still greedy and the community has to bring it arround. Wich it does! Missions Mods everything is comming from you guys! Thanks for that.
8535	1	a	Great game..
8537	1	a	Hmm... Where do I start... Well, imagine this scenerio. You and 5 of your best friends are told by a commander to please take out an enemy/ hostile base. You have an amazing pilot who takes you there. Its night time and you and your crew are all in the chopper getting ready to attack. Ropes come down from the chopper and you and your 4 friends land on the ground. Immedatley one of your friends gets sniped right beside you. The chopper lands and the pilot is asking what happended. You put your friend on your shoulders and start taking him to the chopper for a heal up. The pilot starts giving him CPR. You and your friends go towards the enemy base. Taking them out with advanced stategies and tactics. Finally you finish them off. One of your teammates was hit. He's losing blood. You throw smoke for a helicopter extraction. The pilot responds with an ok and heads towards your direction. You tell your friend he's gonna make it as the helicopter becomes visible. The helicopter starts descending when BAM it gets it. Its starts falling and explodes one of your guys goes down. Another rushes in to save him and catches fire and burns to death. Its just you and the guy that limping holding each others shoulders heading back to base far, far away. Your friends gets shot while going over a hill. He dies as you try to save him. You keep walking as suddenly you see a car approaching. Enemys come out as you put your hands up. One pulls the trigger, then again your getting shot constantly. You fall on your knees. Someone shoots you in the head. You fall... And its over.  This is just ONE of my hundreds of experiences with gamemodes from Battle Royale to Serious RP to Wasteland, King of the Hill and so forth. I could never recommend a game so much...
8539	1	a	Takes me back to the days in 'nam
8541	1	a	If you're into self deprevation and hating yourself, than this is the game for you. Every modd for this game looks amazing, and turns out to be completely buggy and unplayable. Cheers.
8543	1	a	Its not COD 0/10 -ign
8545	1	a	Flying tanks, aimbot AI and all rounded shenenigans and barrels of Charlie Chaplins everywhere. Get this game!  ROCKET GIVE ALPHER PLZ! à¼¼ ã¤ â—•_â—• à¼½ã¤ Give SA! Rocket Plz
8547	1	a	The best tactic-shooter on the market. Really like it, especially the different gamemodes, for example king of the hill, or altis life. But even if you have a really good PC, it will still be a bit of laggy, it needs a lot of resources. 09/10
8549	1	a	Its a very good game. :D
8551	1	a	ArmA III is great. Arma II aside, thereâ€™s nothing else like it. As time goes on will only get better â€“ but, at launch, it feels a little like moving sideways rather than forwards.
8553	1	a	roleplay to the point of it being depressing and stop playing it for weeks
8555	1	a	Best War simulator you can get!!   If you looking for immersive play, where you affraid for your life. this is the game!
8557	1	a	Great game really love the customization of the game 10/10
8559	1	a	This is the dogs nads....
8561	1	a	Good game so many mods and addons a 3d scenario editor just get teamspeak get a couple of friends and arma is the best game ever but i have 1 problem NOT WORKING ON MAC OS i want to buy a Mac Pro and i want to play arma bohemia pls Apple is the best company ever why dont u support mac almost every american has a mac book or a mac pc and im planning to buy one too cuz theyre so good and the beautiful apple on it is the most important part getting a little bit off topic huh ?
8563	1	a	pretty good tbh
8565	1	a	I have put in a nice amount of hours into this game and it's truly beautiful, I have to say one of the best Military Simulators out there along with all the mods that spice this game up. But anyways with any game there are some bugs and glitches and Arma 3 isn't rare with those. And one last thing If you're playing with AI prepared to get rekt those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s can see you coming from miles away and have nearly perfect aim, although there not the smartest about moving into cover when they see you, nor are they the smartes if you flank them, So yea if you're going to play against AI flank them.
8567	1	a	I know it says recommended, but if you have no patience or toleration for bugs, crashes, and a large amount of trolls and hackers don't get this game. That being said, if you are ok with dealing with a un-optimized, buggy, but AWESOME game: it is best to wait for a sale because $60 is a large amount of money. But if you are seriously considering getting the game read below.  | | | |  \ / \ / \/ \ /   Now to that you have the game start to familiarze yourself with the gameplay, but don't get too frustrated because they can be a bit wonky if you have never played a tactical shooter.  Once you do this, there are two big player bases to this game: RP (roleplayers) and MIlsimers (hardcore tactical military simulation). I am a mixture between the two but I can't say I'm more towards one or the other.  If you like the sound of doing roleplay and want to jump right in, find a good Altis life server my favortite is CGIs server.  Oh wait you don't like roleplaying but you really want to be a hardcore milsim player then my suggestion is to find an 'online military unit'. The 15th MEU is a good one as I know a few people that are members. With many of these military simulation units there are age limits, it is usually 17 but all communities are different.  I really hope this review helped some people decide if this game is right for them as there are many people that absolutly hate the game and then there are people that are completely adiccted to it and play nothing else.
8569	1	a	it's ok
8571	1	a	very good role play and domination game but note u need good computer (I AM GOOD)
347	0	a	3.5/10   If you are a passive and slow in playing game this is the right game for you. It is too slow and has SOO MANY GLITCHES YOU HAVE NO IDEA!! I will give it credit becase it is like skyrim, free roaming type but the controls are too much and in general, it sucks, i would recomend no getting thi sgame and not wasting your 60 bucks, keeps it for something better. Please, don't buy this game.
8573	1	a	joined a Wasteland and spawned. ran up a stairway and died. 10/10 would die on stairs again
8575	1	a	I would not say this game is worth buying at full price, but I can tell you that it's really fun nonetheless. There are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated Arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good. The game requires a really beefy computer to not run on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you don't want to see â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics, then don't get this game. However, if you're up for an intense milsim, then get this game.  Rate: 8/10
8577	1	a	The vast amount of game modes will keep me entertained for hundreds of hours and I've only played two of them! Altis Life is fun and wasteland mode is some of the most intense FPS action I've ever played.
8579	1	a	Call of Duty's more educated and respectable older cousin. An FPS for the thinking man who appreciates the real life brutal realities of combat. This game doesn't grab your hand and guide you to its breast, this game makes you work for your entertainment. Treat this game right, take the time to understand its nuances, and never underestimate it's bite, and you'll have a much more rewarding experience than you can achieve with most FPS games. When a mission is carried out via your own strategic wit and whim, and hours are spent infiltrating and avoiding enemy patrols so that you can make it to that perfect firing position for your sniper, it really makes that one shot a lot more heart pounding than any round fired in any other military shooter. If you have ADHD, watch wrestling, appeared on Jerry Springer, think Call of Duty is a good game, and/or are the offspring of two genetically similar parents, you will NOT enjoy this game.
8581	1	a	Very Good.
8583	1	a	This game is epic, if you're a Battlefield or COD troll then I suggest you move on to something like SiMS. Don't waste your time on campaign mode, get yourself onto multiple player, find a clan, get on TS, and trust me you wont look back.   See you on the battlefield â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es
8585	1	a	Amazing Game would recommend to 100% Everyone
8587	1	a	I mistaken a rock for a car. 11/10
8589	1	a	Game has amazing graphics. That is all I need to say.
8591	1	a	Arma 3 is probably one of the best games ever in my opinion. The RPG is unbeatable and people who play this game like to actully play it legit.
8593	1	a	If you are into Stat Padding then this is not for you. Yes the Arma range has been problematic but Arma 3 has solved most of that. This is a game of patience, team work and skill. If you are a 1 man platoon then yes you can play but you wont get the full experience this game offers. This game has so much to offer and such a large community adding content that you should give it a tryâ€¦.
8595	1	a	One of the best military sims out there. If you like immersion/sandbox, then you will love this.
8597	1	a	Good but wish there were way more planes
8599	1	a	I play ArmA 3 since Alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. Its currently best game to buy if you think about Tactical FPS game, and also it isnt just that you buy ArmA and its all you get. ArmA 3 like ArmA 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. DLC-s like ZEUS make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. Only thing i wish to see in future ArmA 3 development is more DLC (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and Directx12 witch will help to improve performance.
8601	1	a	I love this game, it has brought me plenty of fun and I can assure you that you will like it too. If you have enough cash to buy this game (as it is expensive) I highly, highly recommend.
8603	1	a	You won't regret this! Unless you're FoshoTM
8605	1	a	this game took away all my downstairs hair
8607	1	a	Good game. It's not worth 60 bucks. Game is glitchy and still needs lots of works. Feels like a Alpha/beta game.
8609	1	a	The engine man! get it now!
8611	1	a	What's people complaining about? DLCs a rip off? Then don't buy the DLC. No one asked you too. But if you do want the DLC, then buy the dlc bundle if you have the game already. BUT if you don't have the game right now, buy the Extended Edition. (You can wait for a sale on that) This game is such an improvement over Arma 2. Graphics are better, physics are better, and now BIPODS. If the game isn't running nicely, you can go into the launcher and tweak the settings like adding more RAM for the game to use and how much cores.
8613	1	a	I loved (still love) Arma 2: CO and Arma 3 is a brilliant successor. They've added a lot of polish to the game, made movement feel much smoother, and really improved the graphics. With Steam Workshop, new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent user-made missions out there. Moreover, there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game. I've put more than 400 hours into Arma 3 playing and creating missions and that's just in single-player. I can't recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic, open-world shooters. It'll be installed on my PC for a long, long time.
8615	1	a	I laughed, I cried, I shot people in the face....
8617	1	a	Excellent game, I would highly recommend.
8619	1	a	Great game
8621	1	a	oh soso good :3   This is one of the best games of forever :D  10/10 IGN 'kinda good i guess'
8623	1	a	great game my friends need this game fun to play with a bunch of people
8625	1	a	Dear beiber fan _69,  Here my love xoxoxoxoxo HB  sort yo ping den wees play togeth  gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg   Lov Dirty mike and the boys   - Trev   Thanks bro for this Amazing game  and the Review: this game is amazing, smooth engine, great missions, a nice step up from arma 2, Downside: multiplayer is to time consuming. qq
8627	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Love playing this game. need to be worked on some more but great game and modding community.
8629	1	a	its like an army simulation its so real ! it might laggy at somme points but still a good game
8631	1	a	One of the only game where i spent more time on the graphic settings for optimal 60fps and training in the tutorial than actually playing the game. Aside that the control are smoother than arma 2 and feels more optimized but the content is still lacking. It become a great game if one get invested in it, otherwise pass your way if you expect playing it like a regular FPS with WASD and left click, you'll become a machinist on your keyboard.
8633	1	a	Its so real its almost like am actually playing a video game.
8635	1	a	Can't recommend it more, try it out!
8637	1	a	This game is the best Arma game in the entire series it is truly an amazing game. The graphics are suprisingly good and the gameplay is very fun especially if you like realisic war games that takes teamwork and strategy to stay alive. But I would not recomend this game to the daily Call of Duty fan boy guy, this game is slow paced and takes LOTS of strategy and teamwork, unlike Call of Duty's run and gun and lone wolf type of game. If you are familiar with Arma 2 this is everything you love with better graphics and physics, for example. Arma 2, you shoot a man he stands there for a sec then falls down and dies with no blood affect. Arma 3, you shoot a man he realistically falls (some what rag doll physics) and there is a realistic blood affect. Overall I think the game is great and I give it a 10/10.
8639	1	a	This game is too hard for me.
8641	1	a	Best game ever. No need for explanation. On of the only games created that should be worth more than $60.00
8643	1	a	The newest game in the Arma series from Bohemia Interactive offers a wide variety of new vehicles, weapons and gameplay options. If you like war-games, but want something a bit more realistic than 'CoD', Arma III is for you!
8645	1	a	it is a good game i love it
8647	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balls
8649	1	a	To start off, this game is AMAZING. There is so much you can do in this game. I would call it basicly Garry's Mod with its own engine, amazing graphics, and a even better gameplay experience. There is multiple ways you can play this game. One, being its singleplay (Its 'okay' not the best, very good to learn the basics). Two, mission gamemodes, these can range from being 'Wasteland' to 'Altis Life' which are all fun and you can put tons of hours into them. And lastely, Mods, the PC community is known to make mods for popular games, you can play mods like 'Epoch' or 'Breaking Point' which are mods that are made to be like DayZ. Then there is the popular mod, 'A3L' which has brought a lot of attention to mods and arma 3 it self. Sometimes at night, with the light setting on Ultra it was the best looking lights that I have ever seen in video games EVER. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this game 9/10.
8651	1	a	The game is Great, but when I try to host my game crashes!!
8653	1	a	I have to say, this game blew me away the first I tried it. Here's what I think of the game:  Pros: -Realistic, if you get shot twice your dead, no regenerative health. -Editor allowing you to create your own missions. -Hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -You don't always have to be the commander, or even fight.  -Multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the AI. -Makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -Actual terminal ballistics. -Booming mod community.  Cons: -Hard to learn controls (If new to series) -Some minor bugs (This will go away hopefully after beta, so I'm not taking a point away for it)  I can't think of any more. So, overall, I give this game a 10/10.  EDIT: Just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people:  Optimization issues. New score: 8.5/10.
8655	1	a	If you get bored of all those CoD/BF clones out there, try something 'new' and more real. In Arma 3 one bullet can be your end, at 'full health'. How it should be. It has far better emersion than any CoD, BF or CS game ever had.
8657	1	a	Ran for barely a minute, couldn't run anymore. 10/10
8659	1	a	This is the most realistic game i've ever played. Everything from the cars, armored vehicles, helicopters and jets to the boats and combat, this game has it all! The controls are completely realistic to a certain point. The possibilies in this game are vast for a war-based shooter. You can customize how you look, how your guns look, even how your vehicle looks! I highly reccommend this game to anyone looking for some realism.
8661	1	a	Roses are red Violets are blue I am a dog  10/10 'Would Takistan again ' -IGN  
8663	1	a	If you like DayZ style mods, this is the game for you.   A true survival sim, yes you still have to use your imagination and yes there's a steep learning curve but it's worth it if you think you have what it takes to be a survivor.  -Breaking Point (DayZ with factions) -Epoch/Overpoch (DayZ with base building and more guns) -Exile (Haven't tried yet but it looks like to be the best 'DayZ' out there atm  Keep Calm And Respawn
8665	1	a	8/10 Excellent game, great tactical shooter with first person and third person perspective. Lots of game modes and even more coming out all the time, so many to name and not enough words for them all. Great Campaign very challenging with many challenge modes to also play. Play with friends or by yourself in land, sea and air combat. Weaponry ranging from Pistols to Rocket launchers ATV's to Tanks Hummingbirds to Jets.
8667	1	a	A very great game to play 
8669	1	a	Buy it as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!! you never try you never know!!!
8671	1	a	Fantastic game with a lot of mods. The best military simulator i have played, you should get it if you have the money. The arma 3 Life Mod actually reminds me of GTA V but a lot of more role play in it. I recommend this game 10/10.
8673	1	a	Amazzzing game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mate love this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game great grafik and much more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ LOVE IT
8675	1	a	I dont own the game but i can write a review :3  Now I DO own the game and I can say it's amazing :)
8677	1	a	this game is amazing it offers hundreds of joices so you can never get bored. this is a definite ten out of ten
8679	1	a	some one plz buy for me
8681	1	a	If you like sandbox games and especially military sandbox you have to play Arma 3, but if you're bad at games that require tactics or you think this is CSGO you should not buy this game. Personally I did not enjoy this game because for me it is pretty boring or maybe has no action, but you decide. However I recomend Arma 3.
8683	1	a	Oh Armaâ€¦ How I love you.  I have put a pretty good amount of time into this game and I believe I can give my opinion on it. Where do I startâ€¦   Experience. This game has SO much to offer and I can easily explain why. I have the worst computer you could possibly haveâ€¦ It is total trash. With my computer I can only run arma at minimal settings, I cant play multiplayer and I can only play on one of the 3 maps. My machine is 9 years old. The graphics card is totally outdated, yet I still manage with 32 fps on minimal settings. I have a bad memory leak with my shity 4gb of ram. It stops me from playing any type of multiplayer and I can only play on the smallest map, Straits. Yet I still manage to have so much fun playing on a tiny map without multiplayer. Worse still, I can only play for an hour before my game crashes due to the memory leak. Yetâ€¦ I have over 320 hours playedâ€¦ That is how much this game has to offer. Id say I only experience about 5% of what arma has to offer and just look at my time played. That is how many hours you can put into this game and still be entertained.  Repetition. Most games tend to get boring after you play them for a while, however good ones manage to keep you into the game for a very long time. Take civilization 5 for example. You try to play for 15 minutes, but end up playing for 12 hours. Arma does the same for me. I can keep playing this game for hours at a time before I finally stop, and remember how shity my computer is... That is saying something.  Fun. How this one you might find funny or bad. While arma will state that it is a â€œRealistic Military simulatorâ€ it has some really funny glitches and other things. I have sent my helicopter to space because I tried to land it on a quad. I have taken screenshots of some really funny death poses and body glitches. I have used a set speed script to make my tank go 500 miles per hour. It can be really fun to do, however if you are not a fan of being able to do this in a â€œRealistic Military simulatorâ€ then that might put you down.  The steam workshop/Modding sites. One of the main reasons that this game has so much to offer is because of the mods available. There are so many great scenarios,mods, maps and so much more that so can simply download in a matter of minutes. I can even begin to describe them due to how diverse they are.  While I would like to make my reveiw longerâ€¦ I have yet to experience the rest of arma. I will be getting a new machine soon and then I will make a full review, but for now I will leave it as it is.  Overall this game is great. I can easily say that this game is worth the price and I can easily say that you will enjoy it. Even with a crappy computer I have managed to spend over 320 hours playing this game with the machine I have.   (Note) There are a few negative things that I do have problems with, but I wanted to keep my review as positive as possible.
8685	1	a	Closest you can get to a real life war simulator. 10/10
8687	1	a	This game is amazing I think everybody should have it king of the hill is my favorite game on you should also try to get modded things like Arma 3 life maybe Takistan overall it's a really good game I'd recommend it to anybody
8689	1	a	Don't know why but at 5 pm, every server can't support us with our internet for some reason so be careful when buying it.
8691	1	a	- Best Military Simulator for Infantry. - Great Mod Community
8693	1	a	This is an ever developing MilSim. awesome realism and with the community mods out there, what more can you ask for?!  Get it you will so enjoy it.
8695	1	a	11/10 Ruined my entire life. Arma will ruin every single military shooter on the planet for you. If you are looking for a game that will completely cut you off from civilization, Arma is the game for you!
352	0	a	If you want a realistic multiplayer shooter Arma 3 might be a good game but the campaign is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the story is average the allied AI is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and makes some missions close to impossible cause they love to run strange ways into the enemy line of fire and they dont know how doors or stairs work the AI regularly drives over you or your troop members if you are not really really carefull I have never seen such a bad AI
353	0	a	No tutorial and no easy way to figure out how to play this game. A case of trying to make a simulator but not realizing it still needs to be a fun game. Not fun at all.
8697	1	a	The game is pretty open ended, which is a very good thing and gives the oportunity to have a possibly endless spectrum of gameplay experience and oportunities. From the casual gaming fun moments to the hard core full on military sim career , the easy to use moding system (i say easy but needs caution and alot of research) guaranties that the possibilities are endless. personally i came for the full on mil-sim experience and i gotta say, i got all i was expecting and then some.
8699	1	a	So realistic it'll give you PTSD.
8701	1	a	its great
8703	1	a	Lol xD Rawr Did it for the Badge: But still a really good game. Would recommend
8705	1	a	My rig could barely hold 20fps so i ran around in wasteland shot some people drove a guys car full of stuff off a cliff.  10/10 would run around again.
8707	1	a	highly reccamend
354	0	a	I bough this game and was thinking how cool it was gonna be by watching videos. Sadly, the game nees to have a a buffy computer to have great experience and you need to download/pay for a ton of stuff to be able to play on most servers because it seems like vanilla servers are dead. I don't konw.. On the search system I tried to find TDM DM CPTF but couldn't find any and if I browsed for one I would need to pay for the apex dlc :/ Honestly this might be just me who doesn't quite have enough experience to know how this game works and stuff you can do :P I'll update this if I feel like this might be a good game after all. I have to say that if you like realistic military games then this is the perfect one, it has almost everything that you would have in the army! Hopefully for my future playings I might be able to enjoy it as my wish was to since the start.
8709	1	a	I used to have a job and friends. Now I have Arma.
8711	1	a	Do you enjoy constant CTD? Get this. It's all it does. Get a good desktop wallpaper, because you're going to be seeing it alot.
8713	1	a	  Great war game! Got it on my last PC for a free weekend! I had loads of fun! Thinking about purchasing it for real now!
8715	1	a	Best shooter since, well, arma2. Make sure you try its wasteland mod, specifically sa-matras wasteland. the only legit version of it. Arguably arma2's version of wasteland is better, but arma3 is the future.   pros: realism  cons: not enough realism (sci fi elements)
8717	1	a	This is the best Army-Stratgy-War game you will ever find trust me. you NEED to GET THIS
8719	1	a	Best game ever you can play as a rabbit. 100/10 masterpice!
8721	1	a	In my opinion, much better than any of the previous Arma games. First and foremost where do i start? The animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! The optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. The Co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.
8723	1	a	Must buy! Sure to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay!
8725	1	a	The very best Arma that has ever been made, great Game.
8727	1	a	Everyone knows it is a nice game
355	0	a	Do people REALLY accept the price of that DLC??? I can't accept that price not what so ever until I'm provided more than enough reason to.  Love the game though. Bugs suck so much but meh whats given is pretty awesome.
8729	1	a	Good game, Its fun and it's cheap for a big game so get it :)
8731	1	a	Eats time like the cookie monster eats cookies
8733	1	a	Simple.I loved it gj.Putting money on this game. 
8735	1	a	If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
8737	1	a	Great Game Very Realistic And amazing
8739	1	a	  20 fps is more like 60 fps in this game :P
8741	1	a	it is a lote of fun i hilly recomend this game
8743	1	a	One of the best FPS games ive played by far recommend to anyone
8745	1	a	It has to be one of the best games i've played, and i have played almost every single console and pc game out there. just literally everything about the game is incredible. the realism, the gameplay, just its a truly amazing game i paid $59.99, im fine with that price for future expansion of the game... constantly updating the game. i currently play Arma 3 Epoch, and i really enjoy the mod, most of my hours are from the mod and i havent even tried the other mods yet. highly recommend the game to anyone unless your a call of duty fan boy or your a young kid. As soon as the marksman dlc comes out, of course i will be getting that. so if your on the fence with this game DONT even think about NOT getting it. The one and only one con to this game is gonna have to be the opimization. If you DONT have a intel chipset its gonna be very hard to run this game, i currently am using a AMD 8350 and i only get 30-low 40 fps in multiplayer server Standard settings with a GTX 960, so with me loving this game soo much i am currently saving a little money to purchase a Intel I5 4690k so i can run this game at ease with my card. So if you have a intel chipset and a decent graphics card, you should be fine with this game, and I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend gettng it, if you dont like the vanilla game, the mods make it 200% better. Men Do Real Life Young Men Play Arma Boys Play Battlefield Kids Play Call Of Duty
8747	1	a	What can I say about ARMA.... Well I've logged well over 200+ hours on the game , mainly on CTI. But none the less the game is a masterpeice. I don't mean that it's perfect (because it is far from it). But you will find something here most FPS games will neglect or even bother to look into. REALISTIC WARFARE is the game and Dan is my name. But seriously you will not find another FPS besides BF4 that will entice you so. When you play online and you kill someone from a mile away with a very powerful sniper rifle, I DARE YOU not to feel a bit giddy about it. There is something magical about this games that appeals to me above all other FPS games. When you are in a fire fight you have that feeling of being on the edge of your seat whilst your heart pumps away at the thought of respawning or even when just playing side by side with your mates and helping each other out to defeat an enemy. I have never regretted buying this game and never will! Happy hunting -DH
8749	1	a	Must play game!
8751	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ai but is great fun. pls buy
8753	1	a	Good game to play with friends but if you don't have friends you can find a lot of friends in the server 10/10 would buy again
8755	1	a	Over 1000 hours in arma 3 and 2000ish in arma 2, This games performance ruins all gameplay mechanics no matter how amazing they are. while somedays fps is at 40-60 others (Now) 3-15 quite frankly its pathetic, if i could refund it i would, HOWEVER lets say u have a solid 60FPS ALLL the time, then, this game is 100% â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing and i love it when its like that, the pure nature of the game is unlike all other militarys u will ever find and even though the performance sucks and makes this amazing game unplayable for the few times ive had where i go a full day on 60FPS they have been the best gaming days of my LIFE. In conclusion, if u can run this game at 30FPS and beyond, 100000000)% get itif you cannot, get CSGO :P
8757	1	a	I have killed like 5 people in all my playtime.
8759	1	a	BUY APEX worth every penny
8761	1	a	I knew what to expect going into Arma III from previous experience with Bohemia Interactive games, yet I was still overwhelmed by the amount of features I had to wrap my head around before I could play it with even moderate proficiency. Itâ€™s a first-person shooter alright, but itâ€™s not another â€œleft trigger to aim down the sights, right trigger to shootâ€ kind of game. Youâ€™re going to have to use almost every key on your keyboard, memorize specific key combinations and what each does depending on whether youâ€™re on foot, in a tank, a helicopter, etc.  I felt comically inept fumbling through my first few hours. With so many different firing modes, stances, movement speeds, and other options, I had difficulty just walking, drawing my weapon and firing, to say nothing of using my equipment, making sense of the map, and working with my squad. I had to wonder what my AI squadmates thought of me, the clueless rookie, stumbling into the bushes before I accidently pulverized myself with a satchel charge I didnâ€™t even mean to deploy.  To make matters even more difficult, in its current state Arma III doesnâ€™t offer a real tutorial. Its Showcases (playable scenarios showing off its many features) follow a logical progression that introduce you to increasingly complicated mechanics. However, they each do a poor job of explaining how to use them or how they may be useful later on. The only real instruction comes in the form of on-screen hints that tell you which keys do what. Itâ€™s an inefficient method to teach you how to fly a helicopter, and practically useless when it comes to explaining the tactical value of more esoteric equipment and features.  In one of the more interesting Showcases you are given access to a non-lethal aerial drone and an armed ground vehicle drone which you can use to eliminate targets in a nearby town. After much experimentation, I devised a tactic of sending my aerial drone ahead to scout and tag targets, which then allowed me to coordinate mortar fire and corner enemies in the town. It was satisfying because it allowed me come up with a strategy which felt entirely my own, and one which nearly no other shooter could accommodate. On the other hand, there was a needless amount of frustration along the way that could have been avoided with clearer UI and better instruction.  As you can imagine, Arma IIIâ€™s potentially much more enjoyable when youâ€™re playing online with real people â€“ especially those who already know how to play and can teach us its secrets. It doesnâ€™t have a capped player limit, so in theory a server where 100 players are facing another 100 players in a gigantic sandbox where almost everything is possible is one of the best shooters Iâ€™ve ever played. But without investing long-term in a clan or other group that will ensure a reliable team of significant size, those are hard to come by. In practice, new players are presented with a list of servers half-full of random people who arenâ€™t communicating, and where everything that can go wrong is going wrong. Since Arma III doesnâ€™t offer obvious incentives for players to cooperate or even funnel them to the same areas of its enormous maps, multiplayerâ€™s mostly uncurated chaos. Itâ€™s amusing in its own way, but something I would rather watch in a YouTube video than it play myself.  Counterintuitively, smaller matches are more fun for a new player trying to find his way in this world. In one pick up co-op game, six fellow players and I (and a group of AI bots) were tasked with a simple mission: find a way off the island. We spawned at a random spot along the coast and were given two locations, miles away, where we could find a boat or a helicopter for extraction. We ended up not even making it halfway to either destination, but I enjoyed our journey quite a lot. We heard a gunship in the distance and dashed across a field to take cover in a forest. We stumbled upon and successfully seized an enemy outpost, where we commandeered a truck. We arrogantly tried repeating the same strategy with a larger town on our way to an airfield... and were caught in the open by snipers. This is what developers mean when they talk about emergent gameplay, and itâ€™s where Arma III shines.  Altis and Stratis, the two islands that serve as its massive military sandboxes (270 kmÂ² and 20 kmÂ² respectively), are truly impressive and the foundations that make everything else about ARMA 3 possible. Whether youâ€™re scuba diving to disable mines or sniping from a church atop a high hill, everything looks crisp and sufficiently believable... as long as you donâ€™t look too close. Thereâ€™s an obvious amount of recycled assets used to fill all this space, and many empty buildings. With its overall clinical style, Arma III can seem sparse, even boring when you stop to smell the roses.  Its sound design, however, is disappointing at any distance. It suffers from laughably cheesy electronic music and sound effects that make some actions feel insignificant, vehicle movement and firing in particular. For all I know thatâ€™s what tanks and helicopters really sound like, but it makes them feel like toys.  But like I said, this is a game where we have to make our own fun, and at least Arma III makes that much relatively easy with a built-in mission editor and Steam Workshop integration. Itâ€™s inherited the modding community that brought us such hits as DayZ, and as its marketing materials insist, Arma III really is a â€œplatformâ€ more than a stand-alone game, and what it may evolve into in the months and years after release adds immeasurable replay value to its $60 asking price.  Arma IIIâ€™s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once youâ€™re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, youâ€™re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat thatâ€™s simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable, making Arma IIIâ€™s nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know thereâ€™s a long, dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light.
8763	1	a	its okay, performace is a nightmare even if you optimise the game, but I guess thats what you get for using the since 2001  disclaimer: i dont actually know for sure if the engine was made in 2001 i heard it and im too lazy to google it please dont â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lynch me
8765	1	a	It's aight
8767	1	a	Honestly the best game ive ever played.
8769	1	a	Game of The Year! Even after the release was Published in 2013! 10/10~
8771	1	a	Amazing game! Two thumbs up.
8773	1	a	Really great game. Put in so many hours. Different types of game play and many mods. I fully recommend this game.
8775	1	a	Good Game But Too many Glitch,Die For No Reason (5.1/10)
8777	1	a	The most joy you will get from this game isn't in the playing itself, but instead the creating of your own custom content and seeing others enjoy it.
8779	1	a	I like this game when I get bored of Cs
8781	1	a	Gather a group of friends and play on a wasteland server! Very fun and very intense gameplay if you go for the missions that pop up on the map, but make sure you gather resources like good weapons, armor, food and water, beacause your enemies will.
8783	1	a	Military simulation at its best. If you want to try something different other than arcade COD/BF, definitely give this a try.
8785	1	a	i dont even own this game XD
8787	1	a	Man, max this game out graphically and you are in for quite the treat! This game is incredible in the short time I have played it. Did most of the tutorials and simulators and started Campaign mode. I absolutely love the realistic way of the shooter (if you can even call it that). They did plenty of research and work for this simulator and it shows.   I would recommend this over any other title in the genre any day. Looking to take a break from the run and gun? Arma is your answer.
8789	1	a	There do not exist a better realistic tactical shooter out there. The mod support is also a bonus.
8791	1	a	You know. This game is great! If you love flying helicopters and getting hookers!You will die to play this game forever! I know when i first bought it all i did was watch my guy sit on a rock! Its like im watching a second me watching another person play this game watching a hooker inside a game inside another game! what im trying to say is... This game has hookers!!!! GET IT!
8793	1	a	any 1 givin arma 3 away i would be most gratefull 
8795	1	a	TL;DR Score: 9.0/10  Quick Review: Just from playing a few game modes (it has many), the games are endless. good with friends, good anticheat, i personly play Altis Life gamemode alot, since its basicy a better gmod in terms of graphics. Controls are still a bit like you want to scream at your guy, however it does still get tweaked here and there, with updates still rolling last i saw. Tons of replayability.  Pros: Â» Tons of diversifying gamemodes. Â» Ok-ish graphics Â» Good anti-cheat Â» Some major communities you can get involved in.  Cons: Â» Feels like my character is unable to follow simple 'turn the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around' orders sometimes. Â» not much major difference compared to Arma 2 in graphics, but i might be wrong (been a while)  Main Review: Again, as with Arma 2 review, iv not played much besides king of the hill and Altis Life (which i love), but the game has improved alot, has a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of gamemodes all varying from each other alot, and a massive amount of items in the game. (weapons, gear, armour, clothing, etc), hell iv not even scratched the surface of what to expierience in the game yet, nor have i done the basic operations on single player. xD  Any Updated Review:
8797	1	a	i owned it once but for some reason i dont anymore i didn't refund it idk but it was cool while i had it, the campain was hard dough
8799	1	a	love the game so glad i got this!!
8801	1	a	It's pretty good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when you have mods.
8803	1	a	Amazing army simulator that's more than just 'DayZ.' Buy this game if you want a more realistic experience than 'Call of Duty' or 'Battlefield.' 
8805	1	a	This game is fricking amazing its got HD textures and the driving and shooting is well thought out and that just makes this a whole lot better. There is nothing I dislike in the game
8807	1	a	Arma for life
8809	1	a	+â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of content, community content of course. -not allowed to pick up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DLC GUNS IF YOU KILLS SOMEONE
8811	1	a	got one word for y'll 'epic'
8813	1	a	Ran than jumped off a stone wall than flew like supa man than flew to my death 11/10 BEST GAME NA
358	0	a	This sucks balls compared to A2.
8815	1	a	Only game I really play on steam now. Highly recommend getting it if you like realism in games
8817	1	a	This price is outragous, i cant speand this kind of cash. sure this game is great but still, i want it but for like 20$ pliz.  
8819	1	a	Arma 3 is a semi-new game that was released in 2013, and it is thriving with players! From game modes of Team Death Match, King of the Hill, Zombies, and Roleplay, Arma 3 has tons of game modes for you to play! My absolute favorite game mode is King of the Hill, where three teams pit themselves off against capturing and holding a point, there are vehicles, a leveling system, and different weaponry and perks all included with a cash system.   Arma 3 is open for modders in the Steam Workshop, and this increases great chances for the game to survive upon the universe of gaming in general. Modding is perfect for games, because players can do the work, they can create what they feel is needed, what they want to see in a server, and what they know is perfect for the community.   Good things:   -Great combat  -Tactical combat, and meant for strategy, not run &amp; gun  -Has Steam Workshop support and availability, great for modders who want to help the Arma 3 community out!  -Plenty of gamemodes, ensuring to keep you endlessly drooling for what may happen next  -Plenty of vehicles   -Large, full scale maps with the ability to go inside almost every building  -Destructible enviroments (limited to some different entities)  -Amazing campaign, and tutorial (the tutorial kept me entertained for a good while)   Bad things:   -The game has a semi-steep learning curve to it  -Some minor bugs like playermodel glitching, etc  -Things arn't fully destructable like in the Battlefield 4 engine (but good enough)  -Graphics may seem outdated on some models  -It's abit hard to get into the game as a new player, but you'll grind into the game eventually   Neutralities:   -The game requires teamwork, and a mic if you want to be involved in so, although there are many lonewolfs out there  -Your average PC might be able to handle it, it all depends  -Cats enjoy watching you play it (atleast mine does)  -You may have tons of fun in this game if you know how to play it in your own special ways, wether it is transporting toops via aircraft, or by infantry squads/ground missions, to full-fledged combat in the many suburban towns of the maps in Arma 3  Overall, I  do  recommend this game to anyone and everyone that is around 14+ of age, whom can understand how to work things, and avoid the sharp learning curve, along with that I really do hope that for any of you that have quit the game because of the learning curve, to give the game a few more tries, as I did this before, and I came back loving the game.  If you'd like, you can add me and play with me on Arma 3, Garry's Mod, TF2, CS:GO, Battlefield 4, and many other games that all of you should commonly know if you're an average gamer, anyways, take care.  
8821	1	a	such freedom, very tactics, much stress wow
8823	1	a	Arma 3 is a military simulator. It's not supposed to be played like Call of Duty or Battlefield where you run and gun, but you most certainly can. It helps to play this game with other people, because the AI isn;t very helpful. There is also the problem with bugs that come with any Arma game. You will break your legs from running around, you will get trapped in the world, and you will get stuck doing simple actions; you will also love every minute of it. When you learn how to deal with these issues, the game is an absolute blast.The draw of the game isn't the base game, it is the mods. Just like Arma 2, this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like Arma LIfe, Epoch, Battle Royale, Breaking Point... just to name a few. Just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you don't have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong.  9/10 Would fly a helicopter into a tank again, bring a friend, but please fix the annoying bugs.
8825	1	a	To much fun
8827	1	a	This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you haven't played it, then you should probably save your money instead of buying cases in CS:GO. Only problem I have is that the game is only optimized for Intel Processors, so basically anyone who bought a AMD processor is screwed. With a team as big as they have, you would think they would work on it. Especially for all the people who spent money on this game, but never got to experience it as they should have.
8829	1	a	Best army game 10/10
363	0	a	This game was so fun until this new Apex DLC came out and completely ruined the game and play style and the new UI is cancer. I just wanted to play it i opened it then realized it has the Apex DLC and i slowly moved my cursor over to the X in the top right and clicked... RIP Arma 3
8831	1	a	this game is great
8833	1	a	Most if not all reviews of this game took place before they had a campaign, workshop support, and Zeus. I love this game... Thats all i have to say.
8835	1	a	I don't even know where to begin with Arma 3.   Pro's: Realistic combat that really gets your heart pumping at time. Realistic scenarios complete with standing by to stand by while you wait for your commander. Fun that just makes you smile for hours and hours.  Con's: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ framerates online regardless of your system. It simply doesnt matter what you run for a system. You will have poor frame rates if there are more than 20 people in your game. Desync detracts from a lot of the fun, however you can generally play through most of it.
8837	1	a	Awsome game ;)
8839	1	a	~ DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE HERE FOR AN ARMA LIFE REVIEW ~  Arma 3 is a great game. Although it can be hard to enjoy it when you are constantly playing on domination servers with frustrating teammates. That is why it is important for the players who are interested in the tactical, militaristic simulator Arma is meant to be that they get in touch with the many groups out there. I was so bored on Arma until I found my group, now I actually play with a group who know each other by name and don't just mouth you all the time.   + Great Game, Highly recommend! + Huge amount of mods to improve gameplay + Amazing private communities!!!!! +MODS &amp; MAPS +Mods lol   - Vanilla AI are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - Public servers can be frustrating with noob pilots and high pitched children.
8841	1	a	This is a very Fun game and worht the money if u like it sure some parts could be a little berter but over all it is a really good game I can get 30 FPS on a muitiplayer server with a 500$ labtop
8843	1	a	Good game. I probably spend too much time playing it, but there is just so much to do.
8845	1	a	Its the greatest game i ever seen in my whole life 
8847	1	a	Best of its kind ot their. However you need to be a patient learner as their is a steep learning curve and i would recomend finding a group or friends to teach you
8849	1	a	I shoot at 3 men in a field   Killed a goat  11/10
8851	1	a	It's one of the best FPS/Simulation games out there to enjoy non realisticly or realisticly however you want to play it. Really fun without friends to easily meet and make friends online but if you play this game with friends mod-wise or vanilla, you will have a blast I can guarantee.  The most fun I had was the cooperation servers on Linux server betas where we all worked together to destroy the enemy and unlike any other game the AI is pretty smart to notice you're not a friendly. So it is challenging to fight against them and its fun new experiences all the time, that's just the vanilla out of one gamemode. There is plenty to try and I really do suggest this game if you love working in a clan or solo against the enemy.
8853	1	a	This Game Is Very Very Awesome. 
8855	1	a	  If you like to use a compass, cordinates, and other things to calculate range, and place of the enemy, and don't understand like every person who plays the game, this game is for you         +The Realistic graphics Mil. Simulator. KoTh, Altis Life, Battle royal, And zombie MODES, wasteland and many other modes. and LOTS of running, if u don't have a car, like in wasteland.....Or exile/Epoch..........Or Altis Life................OR KoTH............OR almost every mode. 
364	0	a	its gay you idiot why make a game which is gay 
8857	1	a	Great Game! worth every cent!  
8859	1	a	I started of playing ArmA 2 but came out somewhat frustrated because of the controls and interface, the game explored new concepts but was not an enjoyable or intuitive interace. ArmA 3 and a completley different expirience for me. The game still looked and felt like ArmA 2 but they have fixed my few problems that I had with the previos game, making probebly the best expirience in a game ive had in a long time, The map 'Armory 2' by Happy Comedy makes the game easier to learn alowing players to test out vehiclels, a must have map. The 60 dollar price point can turn people off but trust me, if you are looking for vehiclels, guns, boats, scuba diving, drones, tanks, cars, planes, helicopters, and a @#$% ton of amazing and cool mods, this game is definitly for you.  -Fuze
8861	1	a	I can be a rabit 10/10
8863	1	a	Pretty amazing game lots of addons and user made missions to play would reccomend 10/10
8865	1	a	Difficult, absorbing, I want it so badly.
8867	1	a	I've been playing since release and have expierenced so many great moments with this game. The potential is huge with thousands of missions on the steam workshops and many great mods. The Devs really work hard on the game and have made many great improvements since release like when they improved the gun sounds (MASSIVE improvment). This game will provide hundreds of hours of fun, no moment like the other in the 2 islands the game offers (although a third will be soon released). The only semi negative point I have is the multiplayer. I find the gamemodes that allow for regular combat simulation (not talking about 100% simulation) are pushed down by gamemodes like altis life (a gamemode I love, don't get me wrong, and others like wasteland. The game offers huge customization, vehicles, and weapons like for example static AA launchers, static MG's just as a vague example, all of which aren't used in the popular gamemode. It would be great if it was simpler to find gamemodes such as a good PVP server where you play as a soldier and no 'money' to buy weapons, just a good simulation where both steams are palyer and just fight
8869	1	a	Well. This is going to be gud.  First off was playing King of the Hill.  So I was running around and a â™¥â™¥â™¥ sitting on a hill killed me.  Then I respawned was hiding in a house and stairs killed me #fakyoustairs  Then I got in a chopper and some â™¥â™¥â™¥ kamikazid me what a â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Then I ran into a wall, the wall killed me.  Fell through the floor of a house. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ builder #BlameTheBuilders.  Then I got a jet. May or may not of recreated 911   There is my review of Arma 3. THEY ARE NOT BUGS THEY ARE FEATURES!!!! :D
8871	1	a	To play this game properly, I highly recommend watching Brandon Buzards Guides on YouTube on how to tweak your PC for higher Performance. Also his video on how to optimize Arma 3 was a huge help. I went from avg. 15-20 FPS to 40-60 FPS. Without these tutorials this game will be hard to enjoy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LwIfcW0EnY   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgckg16UC-Y  (They are about 2h but its worth it)
8873	1	a	not bad needs a few improvements
8875	1	a	TactiCOOL
8877	1	a	u shuut guns and fly helicopters wich is fun bt hard i giv this gaim 10/10
8879	1	a	Just purchased Arma3 on the 50% of sale. I have to say I am a huge Arma2 fan, but I was blown sky high when I started playing Arma3. The reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big Arma2 fan. I actually did not know if it was that much different form Arma2. I was so wrong. Arma3 is better in every way so far. Weapons, graphics, sound, player interaction, UI menus, etc. etc. I have only had it for one day now, and it is by far my best PC purchase in a long time. Also, I have bought into all of the survival games on EA to which even though I am happy to support the games i chose to support, none of them have become fun to play for me. I like DayZ Mod and let me tell you Breaking Point for Arma3 is the answer! You get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! The Epoch servers are also so much fun in Arma3, vehicles everywhere on some of them, planes, helis, tanks...etc. So much fun. Good Job Bohemia Interactive and Good Job to all the modders out there!
8881	1	a	a great game! if you can run it........
8883	1	a	If you like open word shooters this game is EPIC! best to get with friends
8885	1	a	First time playing arma was unexpected to say the least. Classic king of the hill match. Im apart of a team of SIX guys in a ghost hawk with some stanger that came along. We enter the AO in the heli. We begin taking fire from both sides. One shot takes out the back roter. All you hear is JUMP NOW! Only 3 of my group jump out and the rest blow up in the air. I land in a tree and my two other group members are no where to be found. We meet up only to be BLOWN UP by a nade.   12/10 Nades
8887	1	a	2014 Best Military Simulator available for the general public. make sure you try out the mod, King Of The Hill (KOTH) 
8889	1	a	Unlike Arma 2 , Arma 3 can give much more. Not that Arma 2 is bad its just that Arma 3 is like gmod. If you want to play DarkRP you join a server other than downloading the addons and only picking from a small ammount of servers sometimes. Along with the ease of access to the numerous amounts of gamemodes it also has a certian play style to it.
8891	1	a	get this  
368	0	a	Bad game. Horrible game engine. System requirements for what? Nope company. Few models. Multiplayer always glitches. Waste of money.
8893	1	a	Drove 10 minutes to get to the objective, i hit a tree and my ATV broke. Had to run for 20 minutes to the obj. and got immediatly shot. 10/10
8895	1	a	This is war
8897	1	a	Pros - This is by far my go to PC game of all time. Are you looking for a gaming experience like no other? Then go with Arma. I've been an Arma veteran for awhile, and don't regret any minute I've put into the game. Yes you do need a somewhat powerful PC to get the best Arma experience, but the community and the people that you will meet while playing the game are what makes it amazing. Check out the video I linked below with some 'Wasteland' gameplay with friends I've met through playing the game! Hope this helped!   https://youtu.be/EZHJVrx7wX8   Cons - Controls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and not as optimized as it could be.
8899	1	a	geart game enjyed a lot,but not much of a multiplayer game..
8901	1	a	Phenomenal military simulation
8903	1	a	I highly recommend Arma 3 if you're into Army games with a (high) sense of realism. You can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. Depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who you're playing. I'm part of one of the largest Arma 3 clans out there (Joint Task Force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a Tactical Realism based clan. Think of stuff like Basic Training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc.  check us out over at  www.jointtaskforce2.com 
8905	1	a	absolutly amazing game!
8907	1	a	Like it's predecessor, Arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. Graphics, Beautiful... Physics, Fluid... Gameplay... Enagaging... You won't find a shooter like it! The number of mods is growing rapidly, and that's what really makes the Arma series what they are today. As with Arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer.  Due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and it's only recently been available! However I would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as I do think Â£40 is a little steep, atleast for me.
8909	1	a	This is a great game. They've fixed a lot of the wonkiness from Arma 2, and the community workshop adds TONS of content.
8911	1	a	DON'T PLAY WITH JOHN COS HES A FK-ING LYING PIKEY TW@T SRSLY
8913	1	a	Good game, much game mode.
8915	1	a	Do you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed, only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet? How about spending 20 minutes to get the the AO only to realize that your team has already captured it? Do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar, just like real life? If you want real military simulation (including the time it takes to get into combat) then this game is for you.
8917	1	a	2700hours and still playing.
8919	1	a	Great and adictive game, and even more addictive when you start to install mods, A little buggy. 9/10
8921	1	a	great game. 11/10 if you dont mind it murdering your system
8923	1	a	Recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. Has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea, land and air) combat.  The weapons don't customise very much, but that doesnt matter so much as there is a VERY wide range of weapons and attachments. Very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. The only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings, as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can, and sometimes becomes annoying. But the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.
8925	1	a	This game is very realistic and i like it a lot. It has every thing guns, vehicles,editors, good AI, Its better than eny call of duty game
8927	1	a	Military nerds! Buy this game for all the military porn you can play with.
8929	1	a	My tank hit a bunny and exploded. Anti tank bunnies- great game fully recommended.  1500/10
8931	1	a	Did two drug runs. Bought a gun, took two people hostage. Made them phone the police. Killed two police officers. I was then tazed and arrested, then put in jail. Someguy flew in with a helicopet and broke me out. 11/10.
8933	1	a	this is a good game!
8935	1	a	Great gameplay,graphics and content, but can be daunting when first starting out. The tutorials are a must and also watching video tutorials helped a lot. Definitely worth sticking with.
8937	1	a	The game is very fun but the 20$ for a helicopter dlc is completely insane.
8939	1	a	I realistic military simulator based on the island of Altis and Stratis.  There is a campaign and multiplayer. The campaign is not that interesting since the multiplayer is where it's all at.  You can play gamemodes such as King of The Hill, Wasteland, Battle Royale and Life Mods.  This is not a fast paced game. You can not just run up to building expecting to kill someone. You have to slowly advance and make sure you are not going to get shot at if you were to stand up.  Shooting is really difficult, if you stand up, it is nearly impossible to aim, crouching is easier and going prone is very easy to aim with.  The game has a virtual Linux and Mac port, meaning it is not a native port. All though, the performance is nearly identical to Windows. The port is an open beta and may be discontinued if the developers feel there is no reason to maintain it. There is no Battleye (Anti-Cheat) workshop scenario support (crashes on start) with this port and the game is slightly outdated. Meaning that servers running on Windows PCs (using the latest version) will not be able to play with Linux and Mac users, sadly. I really wish they go on with this port.
8941	1	a	Good game, the freedom of choice to play multiple game modes. Spent way to many hours playing life servers.
8943	1	a	Great for realism and simulation enthusiasts. But if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked DayZ, you can promptly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and not get this game.
8945	1	a	 I can't tell you how good this game is. Insanely good. And then times that by the biggest number you can imagine. There, I  can  tell you how good this game is.   Lets lay down the basics:  Kids Play CoD, 'hard lads' play Battlefield Real men play ARMA 3.   The mods are extremely extensive. Heard of DayZ? There are no longer DayZ mods due to obvious reasons, but Epoch and Overpoch are pretty much the same as it. Like the Hunger Games series? try Battle Royale. Like massive open-world money-based (ingame of course) team deathmatches? A3Wasteland is your mod. And then there are the singleplayer mods. Iron Front, the WW2 squad based one (which I believe is multiplayer too), Dynamic Universal War Simulator, a massive war of which you are pretty much a field generalblowing up those damn OPFOR kiddos. These are only a few examples of what are to come if you just buy this game.  And could I forget the voice commands? GlovePIE or VAC, whatever your thing is you can just shout into your mic THREE, SUPPRESSING FIRE or TEAM RED, GET IN THAT TANK and they will and you will feel good about yourself.   That's just the mods, nevermind the in depth campaign, which is very extensive or the multiplayer vanilla gamemodes, the DLCs, such as Kart mode and many more that you can just find out for yourself.
8947	1	a	It's good, get it.
8949	1	a	10/10 I have probably spent too much time in this game! The game has so many areas to it so there is always more to do. For example, there is RP mods, DayZ like mods and even servers like CTF. It is so much fun and it is a total must have!
372	0	a	the game is very fun to play with if you have a team or a squad of friends to play with, HOWEVER, this game is not worth (what it currently is) to buy. You still got the bugs like walking down steps and dying, dying from walking into a door, getting launched by rocks. The AI is still pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to arma 2. Plus the damage system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HORRIBLE. The fact that you have to PAY to get marksman stuff is disgusting. Is bohemia turning into the next EA? Probably. Altough its a leap from arma 2 in graphics, Arma 2 was actually better IMO.   Basically it still has the same game breaking glitches that should have been fixed a long time ago. AI is still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Damage system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. And the only things that they did right this time seems to be the ZEUS addition and the graphics.   TLDR: Bugs suck, p2w sucks, too much focus on graphics, zeus is probably the best thing
8951	1	a	Hands down the best military type game there is. Cod and battlefield can't hold a candle to Arma.
8953	1	a	  Hellmann's and Best Foods are brand names that are used for the same line of mayonnaise and other food products. The Hellmann's brand is sold in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, and also in Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Canada. The Best Foods brand is sold in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, and also in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.  Hellmann's and Best Foods are marketed in a similar way. Their logos and web sites resemble one another, and they have the same English slogan: 'Bring out the best'.  Both brands were previously sold by the U.S.-based Bestfoods Corporation, which also sold several other food products in addition to Hellmann's and Best Foods mayonnaise. Bestfoods, known as CPC international before 1997, was acquired by Unilever in 2000.ï»¿
8955	1	a	buy it its awesome !!! 
8957	1	a	Even though I just started playing this game, I would already say it was worth my $60. The graphics are amazing and the detail makes everything look cool af. The only cons I would say are there are so many different controls that you will be referring to the field manual very often. Also, the keybindings are very awkward. For people that play different FPS often and are used to things like ctrl or c for crouch or space to jump or e for interact, they'll be annoyed when they constantly forget it's x to crouch. I was also sort of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that I couldn't change the keybindings...
8959	1	a	Great game with a lot of potential to be something more than it is, unfortunately the game engine sucks. After more than 2000 hours on arma 2 and 3, its still the number one complaint. Maybe they'll get right one day?  If you like Mil sims, get this. This isn't like COD, you won't be doing any 360 no scopes. You may be running to get into position for over and hour to get to your objective and for that one chance of a shot. Tactics is a must, there is no god mode. Do anything stupid and you will be punished severely.  7/10. (would be 10/10 if they had a better engine)
8961	1	a	Really great. Mods that lack 12 years olds. 10/10
8963	1	a	nice game but you will need a beast of a pc
8965	1	a	With all the different multiplayer modes and missions, plus custom made scenario missions from the workshop, this game never get's old. It is a great game for hardcore players. The game is gorgeous. Especially at night. I paid full price for this game and never regretted it. If you see it on sale, it is a must have for military fps fans.
375	0	a	this game is good and all.. but its complete garbage. first of all its fun..... when it actually works... i bought the game for 40 bucks. had fun... but now i cant even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing connect to stupid piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ server without the game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing about how its stopped working. if it worked 10/10. but its so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i have to give it a 0/10
8967	1	a	+
8969	1	a	its arma. buy it
8971	1	a	Great game I will never get bored of it and there are endless scenarios that you can put yourself in to make the game more fun :)
8973	1	a	10 Kart DLC advertisements out of 10.
8975	1	a	First thing I'm getting once it's 75% off (bless the family sharing and thank you Tora). Pure gem for military sim, with next-gen icing on top.
8977	1	a	ArmA 3 is a great game, there are some down sides like the optimization, and the hackers, but they have cleared mainly all the hackers out, but the FPS is still kinda bad. Lots of ways to 'Fix' it, but overall the game is amazing it has so many different game modes to play like Wasteland, Altis Life, King of the Hill, and many more. I really would say if you are looking for a game to have hours and hours of fun, never run out of things to do, get ArmA 3. So many different things you can do.   I rate the game 8/10 because it looks amazing, so many things to do, but the optimization kinda sucks.
8979	1	a	all round good game
8981	1	a	After playing the entire ArmA series I have been very impressed with this game. It brings together many aspects that make it a game worth every penny. While some of the bohemia content is not as desirable as ArmA 2 the modding community has much more than made up for this. The biggest thing however is the fact is ArmA is meant to be played in large groups not as individuals but as cohesive groups which is why I highly advocate joining a realism/ milism unit. All in all I have been very impressed over the 1k hours ive put into this game and will contiue for many more hours to come.
8983	1	a	Holy, What can I say? Bohemia you did it again, there is never a dull moment with this game, one moment I was walking through a forest with my men, being stealthy (I took my pants off to be super sneaky) and one guy set off a mine, killed 2 of my men, we had to fight a whole squad of the enemys my heart was racing.   Think you have had enough of this game? Your wrong, there is TONS of modders out there creating mods for our entertainment, from zombie killing to diving contests, there is a mod for you.  Don't feel like playing a mod? Go to the steam workshop and find a mission that others made, for you to play!!! All in all 12/10
8985	1	a	Great game for immersion, and Infantry simulator... IF... You can find a good server. Many servers will claim 'realism,' but are just a bunch of 'Call of Duty' players who run and gun. That's not what this game is about. If you can find that server sweet spot however, then you have a very eventful and structured experience. Real squad tactics are welcomed.
8987	1	a	I don't have lots of hours but its a ok game.
8989	1	a	Very fun game you can have custom missions but also the 3 fun multiplayer gamemodes life, king of the hill, and wasteland each has its special perks
8991	1	a	Loving this game
8993	1	a	Great millitary simulator game would recomend for people who like to feel like there in the action 
8995	1	a	The latest edition of the best military simulator series. Has a steep learning curve and requires an up-to-date machine to run, though.
8997	1	a	For my opinion this is the best shooter on steam brilliant game.
8999	1	a	I walked and walked for days. Found one guy. He killed me. Had to start walking all over again. 10/10 Would Recommend.
9001	1	a	Arma 3 Is Great!!!!  Let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? I know i am. This game Gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. Sometimes the Action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. Plus Getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.
9003	1	a	Ooh you got DLC:s coming nice! Ooh I have to pay for those :( What OVER 10EUROS FOR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CONTENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME FROM THE START? Aah you got expansion coming nice... How much do we have to pay for that? Let me guess... If you own arma2 and arrowhead you will get some % off? NO CAUSE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU! WE DON'T GIVE A FLYING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IF YOU PLAYED ARMA2 and pre ordered ARMA3! WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY AND â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THE CUSTOMERS!  Still recommend this game if you like Arma at all.  Good Work Bohemia! You have become full BS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jpk0_oDRhA/hqdefault.jpg 
9005	1	a	The Best Mil Sim I ever played. I just finished campaign, it's amazing, immersive and not too long or too short. There are also a lot of good mods and the multiplayer is amazing.  10/10 :D
9007	1	a	Good Game for Roleplaying
9009	1	a	AWESOME SAUCE FOR $32!
9011	1	a	This is a very immersive game, with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities. Every peice of your gear is changeable... i mean sh*t you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a t-shirt if you so please. You can change your camo and helmet and LBV and backpack and every other thing you carry. Everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to LBV or pants/ shirt pockets(and vice-versa). It provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft (if thats what you're into... I am into airsoft) without the 'Hey call your hits' or 'Hey are you dead' BS. You are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the in-game mission editor. Anyway I figured I'd share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in Arma- or any game out there.    I was playing on a mission that I created on Stratis(One of the in game maps). I was leading a 10 man assault on Air Station Mike 26. We were all riding in an APC. My gunner was doing great taking out ground troops, and even took out an Ifrit or two. Out of nowhere an enemy hit the APC we were in, popping all left side tires, stoping it dead in its tracks. I immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark. Unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the APC exploded. In that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed. worried, I threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill, dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles. Once behind the hill I healed my self, and radioed in for a helicopter extraction. I waited and waited until the heli showed up. All I could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating, and the swooping of the rotor. The heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base, taking out enemy after enemy. I knew the helicopter would not last long, as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction, and not any sort of combat, so I called in an attack heli for some added assistance. After the attack heli started to engage targets I sprinted inside the base behind a large H-barrier. I could see lots of enemies. I quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another H-barrier when I was hit. I quickly went prone and healed up, and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base. After about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build I ran up to a building and began to take out target after target, in some sort of spec ops manner(Yeah I was that good). I ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat. After I called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage. It was quite the experience to get the juices flowing.    This game never fails to impress, and I still find myself learning new things about it every day.
9013	1	a	while playing i take off my clothes and carry bloody men around while they float like ghosts behind me like ghosts
9015	1	a	A true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game  Certainly the conflicts of the Middle East are encapsulated in the King of the Hill servers. Driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck, not really knowing where you are going, you squint awkwardly into the horizon; then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb. Seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire. Being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming s***t flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies. The gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall. He is now dead. The passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun, firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops  The car is fixed, you are still alive. You make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades. The truck stops as an rpg slams into it, exploading and killing all inside. You are dead. You respawn and do it all again.
9017	1	a	This game is awesome really fun to play with your friends. Lots of game modes and endless fun. Got it when it was 50% off so well worth it!

9019	1	a	This game is just great the combat the feel, it feels so amazing the atmosphere is so realistic. I must say tho online when I played at least seemed to lag or just wasn't optimized correctly (might be due to it being online and having tons of mods and so on.  Besides that the game is fantastic its so live you feel like a real soldier in battle taking shots and being shot at. Not like COD or Battlefield. Where your the leader and do pretty much anything. But ARMA has never been like that its been more of a real team based where every move you do counts towards the team and can and most likely put them at risk.  I would recommend for those who like full realistic combat.
9021	1	a	yeah i reccomend it as i crash all the time but im hoping to fix that soon and the times ive been able to play it was a fun time killing ai 
9023	1	a	This is a fantastic battlefiled simulator game which is great if you play with a community :)
9025	1	a	This game is Amazing! Battle Royale King of the Hill Breaking Point, Theses are just three of the awesome gamemodes/mods
9027	1	a	This game is one of the best Military shooters. It requires a clear head and patience. 10/10
9029	1	a	there is not enough keyboards in this world to get every keybind harambe/shot
376	0	a	Gameplay is perfect, the idea is perfect. But expect low fps ( even on high end pc's ) Some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. My friends have the same problem. It happens in the city;s. Not in the open. Looks like this game can't be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. The only fix is a entire new engine. Like they are going to do with dayz standalone. I get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20's  If you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. The gameplay is the best part of arma 3. The sound is below average. Not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from
9031	1	a	i cant even begin to say how fun this game is at first theres a huge learning curve but after u will have so much fun theres so many severs and game modes and great moments its fun solo and with friends i would buy again for 80 if your getting any sale its sooooo worth it and its one of the best games on steam 10/10 only regret is not getting sooner   ps cant spell
9033	1	a	im going to give my honest opinion, the community is what makes this game worthwhile, everything from arma life to wasteland, i really enjoy it. However the base game is not great...
9035	1	a	i DONT LIKE WARFARE IN THIS GAME. SOUNDS WIERD RIGHT? well I prefer the altis life!  Update - what a stupid review, i actually now enjoy warfare and would say i am good at it, i have my own gang/clan on arma 3 now and everything with a lot of members who respect me and follow my orders.  Update 2.0 - that last uopdate sound slike i am 9, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my life...   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^GONNA KEEP ALL THIS FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT IN THE FUTURE BUT I AM NOW GOING TO WRITE A REAL REVIEW^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Pros-   - no litle kids - no aim assist - really good mod support - best community ever - insane realism - Beautiful graphics  Cons -   - big learning curve. Took me ages to know how to play properly.   Overall-  Great game, lovely looking with fab community but is very complex...+
377	0	a	When I launch it, it just comes up with the thing with Parameters, and the other three options, HOW DO I GET INTO A MISSION OR MULTIPLAYER!!!!
9037	1	a	Best from BIS 10/10, now just wait for ACE2  10/10
9039	1	a	I absolutely love this game
9041	1	a	why is this game still $59.99
9043	1	a	WTF....... 260 ping and getting kick curse you Battle eye..... and all password server......
378	0	a	Game performance is far too horrible to even play this game past the introduction. You want to look at all the benchmarks online before you decide to buy this. 
9045	1	a	Worth every penny. Fantastic military simulator.
9047	1	a	well can i get my friend this game for free cause he really wants it he has to walk 1k to his friends house so yeah  
9049	1	a	This is one of my favorite games to play!
9051	1	a	I was able to pick up a snake. 10/10
9053	1	a	Arma 3 is a really great game. I loved Arma 2, and I love this game too. It's really awsome and fun to play, the graphics just look amazing, the gameplay mechanics are better then in Arma 2 ( a lot better ). I don't like the DLC thing that they are doing, I mean Arma 3 got so much less weapons and vehicles then Arma 2 + expansions, and the idea of charging us 10-20â‚¬ for simple dlc like marksmen or helicopters that should be part of the main game ( beacuse there ain't much weapons in the game, atleast compared to Arma 2 ), I understand that you want to make money but atleast make the DLC 3-10â‚¬ MAX! It's just not worth spending 13â‚¬ on a simple dlc that adds few guns and a full ghillie, or few new helicopters, or if you are going to make expensive DLC's make them atleast bring much new content with them.  ~Ratings~ - Gameplay: 9/10 - Graphics: 10/10 - Story: 7/10 - Multiplayer ( best part ): 9.5/10 - Price: 6/10 ( beacuse of the expensive dlc but if i had to rate the price of the game without the annoying dlc: 8/10 )  ~~My overall rating is~~ 8.5/10... why?  - The game is worth buying, but as I said above, it has expensive DLC with not much content in it and it makes it hard to play the game without it ( mostly if you play mp you won't be able to acces the new weapons / vehicles and you are kinda in a disadvantage ).  - Sorry for my english, it's not perfect but I'm doing my best :) -
9055	1	a	The best tactic game i ever known and such good grahpics and such smooth gameplay i rate 10/10 also no lag at all
9057	1	a	bohemia did somthing right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love you bohemia but dayz fix it.  Update:since playing this game alot now i have a great understading of it and once you know it it's one of the best games i could play right now 9.5/10 one bad thing altis life squeekers (WORST IS SQUEEKER COPS BEWARE!!!!!!!)
9059	1	a	Amazing game. If you're a fan of the other Arma games, you need this.
9061	1	a	This game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. The singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. The audio is somewhat clear, but I can understand people clearly in chat and I can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. The multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the Altis Life RPG addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of DayZ to surviving and fighting in the world of Wasteland. Last but not least, the editor for Arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. This game is not for the regular FPS players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than Call of Duty or Battlefield. You actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you can't run forever. So at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. Very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. This game is a thumbs up! :D   12/10
9063	1	a	I love this game. so much fun!!!
9065	1	a	I wish I could Pull the sh*t Frankie does. Oh well, I still enjoy getting executed.
9067	1	a	Awesome ***** Have only played a few minutes of the single player, NPC asked me to shoot the medic WTF ? But 50+ hours of Altis life (mod) has me hooked, not since the early GTA games have I experienced the wonder of an enormous game world.  Add the pvp elements from dayz and a thriving community, its the best thing going.  
9069	1	a	Arma3 is a great game for anyone wa ting to burn hours From a developer standpoint the game is easy to code so if any devs are reading this and is thinking about being in the Arma 3 community it's good don't worry I'm a dev for Arma 3 and I wouldn't change nothing about it
9071	1	a	Not for the COD or BF player, there is no bunny hopping here. Arma is a combat simulator. The learning curve is high but the overal exp IMHO is awesome. I've played them and I cant wait for the polished version to be released.  
9073	1	a	'Recommended Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or AMD Radeon HD 7750 with 1 GB VRAM or better'    hahahahahahaha, no. this is a very graphically intensive game and you need a gtx 970 if you want your game to look like the screenshots on the store page, and play at 60fps.
380	0	a	hint 'BIS sucks donkey balls';
9075	1	a	10 -10 Full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play  :)
9077	1	a	it is realy fun i recommend buying it there are mods like wasteland and altis life those are really fun
9079	1	a	The Best
9081	1	a	Awsome game pritty nice grapics ran on full blast fps around 30 but will need a beafy computer to run it on full grapic but i really wish they could combine all arma 2 oa weapons and vehicles into this game and THEN it would be the best arma to me.
9083	1	a	So fresh, so clean!
9085	1	a	So epic I want it so bad
381	0	a	Not worth $60, constantly bombarded me with DLC notifications, modifying is extremely unorganized. A super fun and well made game besides my complaints. I recommend only buying if you like multiplayer, and if it was cheaper than $60.
9087	1	a	I love Arma 3 Altis Life, The Quality of the server you play on depends on the admins, I love the game over all. 10/10
9089	1	a	Excellent sandbox simulation, but unlike others I will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls, pathfinding, etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however, ARMA 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods, game modes, and missions and nothing can beat ARMA 3. i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it, and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.
9091	1	a	Best Military Simulator Ever. 12/10
9093	1	a	Been a big fan of what BI does. Now that we get to Epoch it all up it's even more amazing. From great single player missions to user created content. This is a game that can keep you entertained for years to come!
9095	1	a	The best game Ewer
9097	1	a	Very fun game. Need a pretty good system to run it but it is very good none the less. Performance issues no doubt it is fun. Not to happy on the price though
9099	1	a	Nice game !
9101	1	a	Great game! bad dlc content!
9103	1	a	i still dont know how to play this game
9105	1	a	Good tactical, action, multiplayer game :) 10/10 A lot of weapons i like it !! :D
9107	1	a	This is a really good game but dont get me wrong when i say this but this game breaks quite a bit i dont really know if its just me but besides that the game is amazing so many things you can do in it.  10/10
9109	1	a	Arma III is a very complex game and requires a little bit of a powerful computer to run the game but with all that said there is many more positive things about this game such as its wonderful community, the mechanics of this game, the strategy and close quarters and long range fun fights that are very intsense and the ammount of mods there are that are a availible with this game.  Some of my favourite mods and gamemodes for this game include: -Arma III Life mod -Wasteland -Dayz (epoch and overwatch) -Sector Control (aslo known as King of the Hill)  Pros: -Graphics are beautiful with extreme detail. -Variety of guns and open world exploration. -Realistic Combat.  Cons: -Controlls feel a little bit clunky at first but you will get used to it over time. -Some technical issues. -Takes a good computer to run this game and get 60fps.
9111	1	a	What I love about this game is that it's not about the firefight, it's about the pressure leading up to the firefight.
9113	1	a	Great Mil-Sim. I love the graphics, gameplay, and the amount of content it has. It's endless fun, really. Do you like realistic shooters? This is for you. Do you like military simulators? This is for you. It's been 2 years but this game is still hella fun.
9115	1	a	Really Good Game, Thats For Sure!!
9117	1	a	This game is just one of the best fps i have ever seen.
9119	1	a	Arma 3, a game that blurs the lines between being a military sim and being absolutely rediculous. The engine is powerful enough to allow for small countries to be mapped, have thousands of ai's, and also have over a hundred players. Mods offer near endless content. This game can be litterally whatever you want it to. Zombie survival, milsim, roleplay, or whatever. The limits are your imagination and not if Bohemia will add functionality to allow your mod to work correctly, but when.
9121	1	a	Fantastic sim/game. Learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! If you like action games, blowing sh!t up, team work, driving, flying and diving! Then this is probably the best game out there!
9123	1	a	Great Game
9125	1	a	An amazing game despite the bugs and excessive payment for extra content, I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys realisitic shooters and a childish community.
9127	1	a	the definitive go karting experience
9129	1	a	i'm just so glad this game doesn't have dayz.
9131	1	a	Amazing game. hours of fun played on this and many more to come.
9133	1	a	So along time ago i did a review on this game. But now im older and i understand more about what i said so heres a new one.   I love this arma its not as good as cold war or Arma 2 but its still just as much fun. I play this one alot and as im writing this im playing it i do think you should get the game because its alot of fun and has alot of things you can do in it like.... King of the hill, Life, Coop and much much more   What i like to do is go in the editor and make mission for myself and my friends and we have alot of fun with that also theres so many mods if you dont like the factions in the game you can just go online and download more.
9135	1	a	joins server 10 fps to 30 then i get shot 10/10
9137	1	a	Dear Bohemia you guys made a nice game, yes. The cons are easily noticable, starting witrh the beta ready engine, (we all know this but still love it) The fact that you're money farming people for helo's dlc's and seeing if it works.  The fact you pander more for the life community side this time than the core fans.  But hey, you take what you can get.  It's still a good game if you can find a good unit to play with, and mods. Games legit worth is about $39,99 USD without the modding community.  I recommend this if you are someone who has a vast majority of free time playing Army Barbie or just a kissless virgin who never touched a woman and spends it playing out a simulation of a real life. If you're a core fan. don't bother 90% of core servers are hosted on 4gb of RAM
9139	1	a	There should be more sales on this game 
9141	1	a	I just like flying the jets in this game.  Jets are cool .
9143	1	a	GREAT GAME !!! I LOVE IT EVEYTHING ABOUT IT IS REALLY AWSOME!!
9145	1	a	This is a realistic shooter, with teamwork and everything. At some points you can be so immersed into this game that you think you are a real soldier that is fighting in a war. I also think this is a game that people would say 'Buy this game for me' to their friends or family for the holidays.
9147	1	a	Other than the few glitches and bugs, this game is about the best simulator I have ever played. ITS YOUR CALL! YOU CAN PLAY IT SERIOUS such as RPG servers or even for fun such as Stratis-Altis- Life. The mods available are very fun and diverse! Top NOTCH!
9149	1	a	i love killing people and selling drugs in this game awesome game 100,000,000,000/100,000,000,000 great game who ever the hell made this
9151	1	a	Simply the best team, team orientated, tactical sim there is.
9153	1	a	10.0. The graphics for this game are amazing, but you may need to turn it down in case of lag. The Co-Op is awesome and its great to play with friends. Also on some servers it will get extremely laggy and hard for you to enjoy the game. Do research if you can run it before you buy it. Not a waste of $60.00.
9155	1	a	I stopped playing all other 'war games' the day I got this ! Brilliant game 12/10
9157	1	a	Not the best game in the world. And when they launched it; it didn't even feel finished. This Game is NOT worth $59.99 if you have arma 2, UNLESS you want better graphics or your a die hard Military Sim. Monkey. Now as for the sale's, which one is going on right now ( 2/24/2014 ); Its 40% off, that makes it about $35. BUY IT! This game has many diffrent mods just like arma 2, and if you dont have arma 2, DONT BUY IT! Get this; its $15 more. SO in all: Pros :  Better Graphics More In Dept For Military Sim Monkeys  Cons: Price Less Mods Higher PC Specs ( Expected ) Worst Graphics Than Arma 2 If You Run On Lowest.  Still Doesnt Feel Fully Finished.
9159	1	a	ARMA III  In my eyes, personally i think this is a game. Thank you for spending time for reading my review:P
9161	1	a	one of the best sim games ever made   
9163	1	a	Played King Of the Hill Stole helicopter Everyone entered Helicopter i tried to fly helicopter  I crash helicopter into spawn Got abuse in chat  10/10 would get called â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Pilot again.
9165	1	a	I swam for 30 minutes and the black man ran over by boat.

9177	1	a	I wish this would go on sale already so I can murder my friends like I've always wanted to
9179	1	a	I barely got this game and let me tell you I had the most terrifying experence ever (to me that is)  I just finished Basic Training and finally knew how to play and understand this game, I joined a King of the hill server with 103 people in the game. As i joined i bought the first gun given to you and went on, I marked where my objective was at and catched a ride from a fellow teammate flying a helicopter over to the objective. I introduced myself to him, He Introduced his name as well. His name was John, as we were waiting for more teammates to join us on the ride to the objective, We chatted about this war (Trying to RP Here and he joins me in RPing) As we were chatting he told me that he been playing this game for 769 hours now, and that he was going to quit soon. I told him i understood why, The helicopter was full now and we began to lift off and go to the objective. As we were going there we were shot at and began to crash everyone jumped off and was killed, Me and John were still inside the helicopter that was falling slowly He told me 'Jump, go now you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er.' I jumped and made it into the ocean with a broken leg, I swam up as fast as i can, and saw the helicopter slowly fall and crash into the mountain side, and then exploded. I swam to shore quickly and patched my leg up and ran to crash. I found his dead body and said in chat 'RIP IN PIECES John.' i took his gun which was better then mine and ran to the battlefield. As i made it to the battle field, there were explosions, gunshots, Helicopters crashing and then exploding, and People dying right in front of me. I have indeed seen some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I saw a fellow soldier on the ground i asked if he was ok he replied' Does it look like im â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing OK?'  'I'm crawling for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake when i could be running at the hill and be taking it over.' I said 'Ok, ok here' I dropped a med kit and ran to the Hill we were suppose to take over.  I saw 3 enemies run pass me, i shot at them and killed 2. One of the enemies saw me and began to fire at me and shot at me chest once. I ran and the enemy followed. As i thought i was going to be found and then shot, I attempted to heal up but then he found me and was about to fire when 2 teammates came to me and killed the enemy.  I thanked them, healed up and ran to the belly of the beast. I met a teammate being shot at heavily and was wounded I told him to run to me, he told me he couldn't he was hurt and couldn't run. I threw a gernade at the area where all the enemies were shooting at and got a double kill but 2 enemies survived. He had time to run towards me and survive but as he tried to run towards me a Sniper got him in the leg and made him crawl, as he was about to die he told me to run, the sniper finished him off and hen payed attention to me. The sniper shot me injuring me and i began to crawl. 4 Enemies ran toward sme and all four shot at me. And i respawned. 10 out of 10, will get shot at by 4 people and wounded by a sniper again.
9181	1	a	Found a chance to try RP. Bought a car and equipment before a crew bumped to my car. They stole my equipments and my clothes also my car. I've said them I need to find my kid. They said we will help. They took me a place where they stole your kidney. They stole my kidney and literally gave it to my hand. Then they took it back and put a bullet in my head.   10/10 Would take my kidney on my hand again.
9183	1	a	This ame sucks I can't stop playing it
9185	1	a	Very cool, Very swag I live it
9187	1	a	This game is really pretty.
9189	1	a	Better than ninja Gaidon on hardmode
9191	1	a	Arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks... But hey! let's get past that one con. Arma 3 in general is a frun game, But when you have friends that play it, when i first bought Arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat, but when you really get into it and start playing Altis Life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing, it really hits how the fun this game is, and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics.... 8/10 realy fun game  Pros: Gameplay Altis Life Online Multiplayer  Cons: Physics Single PLayer
9193	1	a	Like Skyrim but realistic.
9195	1	a	Arma 3 is my favorite simulation game I have played on Steam. It's fun to play and you won't get tired of it. The workshop is amazing for Arma there are always lots of missions to play. The helicopters and jets are fun to fly around in. I don't like that there are limited amounts of weapons (so if you want more guns you need to download a mod.), there is also no melee attacks. over all Arma 3 is a really fun game and I highly recommend this game.
9197	1	a	At first, I realized that my gaming PC could not run Armo 3. I spent years becoming a doctorate graduate in theoretical physics to have access to a supercomputer. The supercomputer was able to achieve an astonoshing -1 fps, something I didn't think was possible. As a result, it divided by zero and the universe collapsed.  6.9/10, would play again.
386	0	a	I purchased the Delux Edition expecting the DLC to be included.. Well its NOT inluded, OK, fine its 2 helicopters and the carts suck, i can live without them..  BUT !!!!! WHY THE HELL do i have to see adds for the DLC while I am in game...????????? The ADD's are big massive translucent helmets tilled across my game screen with a large popup window in the centre of my screen that appear every 5 odd min, and you cant get rid of em unless you select L/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥+P..    
9199	1	a	tried to get in my friends car and got hit by the side mirror and died realistic/10
9201	1	a	guys i got this game on the free weekend and now it says update queued and purchase game and it doesnt let me update it haaaaalpppppppp
9203	1	a	im not addicted
387	0	a	poorly optimised piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, pretty good gameplay if you can get past the 10fps tho.
9205	1	a	I was surfing a quad bike around a gun store. 10/10
9207	1	a	Welcome to slow asthmatic jogging simulatar 2015.  From the constant retardation of your teammates to the never-ending kilometer long walks to the AO to just get killed by a random pistol round from some guy 2 kilometers away. I've listened to my soldiers heavy breathing for hours on end because he has the stamina of a 93 year old man. All vehicles will basically one shot you before you can figure out what 9+10 equals. I can't express enough how much I love it when every little bump and rock on the road will completly destroy any vehicle that isn't armoured. You also never know when the game might decide to fling your vehicle half way accross the map when you hit a rock. The lag on king of the hill at 120 players makes my eyes bleed and my head hurt. This game is just amazing!  11/10 would hit a rock at 15 km/h to fly 30 kilometers again.  But in all seriousness: I have always been a fan of the ARMA series because its really different than the other shooters. There are so many different ways to play this game, I spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. I don't play multiplayer that much but it's still a great experience when I get to it. This game is very heavily GPU and CPU dependant so I wouldn't recomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming PC. Mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of FPS drops below 30 fps. This game is really fun and easy to get into. I am proud of the work that Bohemia Interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. The only problem I have with Arma 3 is the poor optimization of the game in multiplayer. Lag spikes and random fps drops sometimes make this game a real pain to play. I rate this game a 8.5/10.
9209	1	a	10/10 player once liked it
9211	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, especially with friends. Once you get tired of Arma 3 you can download the mods - Breaking Point, Battle Royale and others make this an epic title. This game has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my wife off because I play it so much!  10/10 Would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my wife off again.
9213	1	a	this game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part, oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat. the dlc's on this game is great, my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game, it has also a go-kart dlc and that's very fun with friends to race with. so yeah i rate 10/10
388	0	a	If you played BF1942, you've played this.
9215	1	a	Like Skyrim with guns.
9217	1	a	It would be fun they said... It would have cars they said... I would not die horriobly they said... I would not get run over they said... My framerate would not dip below 60 FPS they said... I would have no bugs they said... I would not get pushed off the road by some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a gokart they said...  They lied...  11/10  Would get run over by russian guy again.
9219	1	a	I mean seriously? It may be a laggy piece of absolute cow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But it's Arma â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in 3. 420/10 Would Blaze.
9221	1	a	I couldn't reccommend this game anymore if i tried. It is very fun, very replayable, and intense at times. The Zeus addition to the real time editing of scenarios has made this so much better tahn arma 2 its practically silly. The modding community is as good as it has always been maybe even better. There is plenty of servers and people to play with etc... Go buy it!! nowwwww!!! :p
9223	1	a	Mah hours dawg, need I say more...
9225	1	a	It is a lot of fun if you have friends to play with. 
9227	1	a	this game u get shot alot and you go argh but u keep playing cas it good when u drice car and go swimming. i lik cas you can drive really fast and stuff, in this gam eyou can t shoot anyone cas the y kill you fisrt lol
9229	1	a	I love and I hate it
9231	1	a	Very hardcore game for anybody who likes Mil Sims as much as I do, although, if you are nto used to the ARMA series I do not reccomend it to you, there are so many controls to remeber but you can still learn them! Def a 10/10 game
9233	1	a	This game has brought me hours of fun and i'm sure it will bring me many more. If you have the cash, pick it up ASAP!
9235	1	a	Best simulation game ever!
9237	1	a	Fun army simulator game, although I play it for the RPG city life element. It's also less buggy in comparison to it's predecessor, ArmA 2.
9239	1	a	This game is nice, I like vac, I like vac bans. I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yo sister in bed, she number 1 prostitue in kazakhstan!
9241	1	a	Awsome military/sim game for sandbox lovers! 
9243	1	a	Great game. Would be great with more weapons and a useable bipod. Controller support is great; just a few button maps don't seem to work. Awesome game overall. 9/10 would eat.
9245	1	a	prob one of the most underrated military shooters ever
9247	1	a	The most complex and realistic Tactical Military Shooter ... once ghost recon went down the tubes after ghost recon 1 this filled the void for me and gets allot of my attention and game time :)
9249	1	a	buy it for wasteland mod, never regret
9251	1	a	Pretty Awesome
389	0	a	I found solitaire more fun  1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. If you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. No way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked  Jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to
9253	1	a	Absolutely marvelous piece of art.
9255	1	a	 8/10  There is so much content to enjoy in Arma 3-from cooperative missions to battle royale to wasteland. I guarantee you'll be spending hours playing through it all. The experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. Even though the single player isn't very enjoyable, it's a huge leap from that of Arma 2. If you can catch Arma 3 on sale, I definitely recommend you buy it.
9257	1	a	Fantastic Game ... Best Mil Sim game i ever palyed !! :D
9259	1	a	its good. stop being a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and play arma.  since there's some whiny baby down int he contents  imagine all the things Chris Roberts' said about Star Citizen being able to be any game you want it to be  then make that the truth  that's arma 3.
9261	1	a	I suggest waiting for it to come on sale, then it is definitely worth it. I will forwarn you, the game does not really seem complete at purchase. However, the modding community is amazing and their mods have not ceased in amazing me. I would strongly suggest the mods that add the old arma 2 units and maps (MARSOC and Spetznaz maybe on armaholic for units?). It is really great to go back and see these remastered maps, then playing on them with the updated engine.... WHEW BOY, thats some good stuff. Id say that finding people to play with is really important too, I dont do the altis life games, but i have friends that do and they enjoy it. Finding squads that are nice enough to allow pubbies on are generally the way to go. If you will be playing MILSIM, then for the love of all that is good.... GET TASK FORCE ARROWHEAD RADIO! It will enhance the gameplay experience tenfold. The only real con to it is that sometimes good games are few and far between, but the time you spend to find one is well worth the reward when you get to play! Make sure to star it in your server list. I am not a part of a squad, but if you really want to boost your gameplay, then i would strongly suggest it.  Overall, Im not impressed by BI's work, but moreso the modders. (AND TO ALL THE MODDERS OUT THERE... THANK YOU :D) If you wanna game thats run and gun, this isnt for you. If you wanna game that will challenge you and put your skills to the test, this is it. I will honestly say one thing that pisses me off more than anything is the AI's accuracy, but it is possible to change. Nothing like getting capped in the head by and AI with a pistol 45 yards away...  I would definitely recommend it to people who are tired of COD or BF, or are like me and never really liked those other two in the first place because I jumped into arma :P Enjoy it and have some good times, you may even make a friend along the way!
9263	1	a	This is Petty much BF4 but more realistic.. Better Vehical machanics, Better Graphics, and Alot more recoil. I give this a solid 8/10
9265	1	a	arma 3 is buggy but very fun with friends scenarios great every thing is beautiful couldnt reccomend it any higher
9267	1	a	Huge open world sandbox. Multiplayer desyncs a lot, too many kill trades online. The content is created by users, so there is not that many good missions or multiplayer modes. Theres is about 3 Main modes that people play; King of The Hill, Wasteland and Altis Life.  This is still a great buy and many people are working on creating new missions and improving current missions.   Warning: There appears to be a high number of squeaky kids considering how kids usually are into more casual games. Must be all the Day Z fuzz arma has gotten into.
9269	1	a	awsome game! :)  but can get very boring if playing alone on altis!
9271	1	a	10/10
9273	1	a	Great game with the Breaking Point Zambies Mod :)!  You need a good PC to run it good though xD
9275	1	a	1. Play Arma 2. Pick a gamemode 3. SHOOT THEM â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ES! 10/10 IGN would rate again
390	0	a	Was a fantastic game at one point. It has been ruined hard by power creep. Bohemia made the weapons in each DLC pack more and more powerful to basically force people into buying them, and we are to the point where laser accurate AK-12 7.62x39 rifles can one hit kill people through MRAP armoured windows.  A pile of garbage at this point.   Oh, and by the way, did you enjoy being able to hide behind things like walls and smoke? Well then congratulations, you cant anymore. They changed the way the renderer works so things fade in and out when they're supposed to be drawn or when LODs change. This has had the side effect of making it so that you can see through walls. This isnt even a thing you have to exploit, just being near something else (ie the window that you are shooting out of) can glitch out the renderer and make walls no longer draw, which means you can see enemies (who do not fade in and out).  Its something you personally can avoid, but all the guys shooting you through buildings with AMRs wont.  Wonderful...
9277	1	a	Goes great with the Breaking Point mod! Way better then DayZ!  Edit: seems Exild Mod is pretty fun as well!
9279	1	a	Dont buy this trash game, Looks good on streams looks and sounds fun as F! but the game is trash! FPS chop all servers in games with 1-24 players i got like 100fps + all max settings games with 70-100 people i got like 20-40 fps chopping also the game lags alot the mic chat is GODAWFUL annoying! people in global chat with there mics lagging bad due to severs. The game is worth 10-20$ tops until they fix the problem they never fixed in arma 2 or never will fix cuz they suck at scam money from people. Worst game of the year No joke
9281	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ awesome game. Get it when it goes on sale. Play it for the mods. I mainly play it for Battle Royale, an extreme survival mode.
9283	1	a	Like its predecessors, ArmA 3 succeeds at supplying a realistic, entertaining, and accurate game experience that provides great scenery, new weapons and units, a community-based scenerio workshop, and a game that can be played professionally with a developed community or leisurely on a public server.
9285	1	a	GET IT
9287	1	a	TL;DR: Pros: -Extreme realism (damage, movement, fatigue, healing, equipment, ect...) -(sink or swim) training of very valuable combat skills used in real life and useful in other games -very useful AI companions (most of the time) -everything has a counter and can be taken down with the right equipment and/or exceptional skill and/or lucky shots Cons: -Extreme difficulty (probably harder than darksouls at times, save often between engagements and stay with your team) -Characters occasionally feel emotionally stunted -obvious 'god mode' NPC sometimes (coughcoughfirstmissioncoughcough)  Too Long;Read it anyway:  One of the most realistic warfighter simulators to date. As such, it's also difficult to the point where anyone who plays a 'standard' FPS will quickly die due to lack of caution. Everything is simulated to an extreme degree from the problems associated with exaustion and fatigue resulting in slower movement and trouble aiming, to the reality of taking fire causing tunnel vision, realistic injuries, and extremely quick death.   One of the first lessons you will learn in this game is to keep your head down and look for cover. Always be looking for ways to find your enemies before they find you and never take any advantage for granted. The second someone knows where you are before you know where they are, you are at a crippling disadvantage as it is all too easy to line up a steady shot and kill someone before they even knew you where there. A good way to learn just how scary it is on the modern battlefield today for anyone involved since you'll find yourself relying on your AI and player teammates almost more than you rely on your own skills. You might find yourself actually following around the AI for cues and clues on how to fight and the level of communication between both players and the AI allies is far above what most games have ever accomplished on a practical level. Simply put, this game has NPCs that you may actually find a bit of value in compared to the inaccurate, incompetent, prescripted 'spehshul farces' NPCs you see in other games  The actual campaign is pretty good too, giving you a good look (in my opinion) of what combat arms guys would actually deal with in a desprate situation (out numbered and out gunned in a hostile foriegn country with little in the way of support) I wont tell you how things got this way, but right from the start, the entire remaining NATO forces (in that particular area of operations) are hanging on by a thread and fighting a larger, albiet less experianced, local military and it's extremely satisfying to survive each mission and see the desperate struggle continue.   Now as great as the AI is in this game, it's not without it's flaws. They are skilled, but occasionally have path finding issues in vehicles that make you wonder who gave these guys their license. In the campaign, occasionally the 'god mode' will kick in and reveal that the character is obviouslly story critical before they actually are but it's rare enough that you won't be annoyed by it long and chances are that you'll be too busy trying to stay alive to notice it.   There is also the fact that I think that maybe they could have increased the emotional factor by allowing the characters to grieve a bit more over the loss of their buddies during and after combat, as sometimes it feels a little cold that they just ignore it other than a call out that someone's down. You see it effect them every once in a while for certian characters but really it seems they either aren't really feeling it right then or are really good at not showing it which is something that legitimately happens so I find it forgivable for the devs to have not made the call outs for each death a little more emotional. There is another factor I think could play into why they can keep it to '(number) is down' but for spoiler sake, I won't say that theory here.
9289	1	a	arma 3 is a good game you should buy it unless you're a part of isis
9291	1	a	Fantastic and has a great community and Life mod
9293	1	a	Awesome military sim
9295	1	a	Probably the most realistic combat sims ever
9297	1	a	Definetely worth the money!
9299	1	a	i dropped the soap
9301	1	a	Eat, Breathe and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Military life. Fantastic.
9303	1	a	Its OK
9305	1	a	Walked 5 Miles just to be Shot by a Sniper  10/10
9307	1	a	I highly recommend this game. very realistic, very hard. what i like most about this game is the combat is not over in 5 seconds like most action game eg call of duty. Also with all the wide range of guns and very unique future vehicle makes this game incredibly fun.
9309	1	a	Vanilla ARMA 3 is alright, but ive found it to be better with mods from both the Workshop and Armaholic. Ive got in total about 30 monds that run everytime i play.   I do however dislike the fact that they went all futuristic with the guns (the MX series is 'based' on the ACR) Leaving it up to the modding community to devolope mods that add in better guns :)
9311	1	a	Amazing military sim! Endless expansion posibilities, and already plentiful mods!
9313	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends or by your self. There are lots of game modes you can download and install such as: Battle Royal,Wastland,Altis Life ext. If you are bored of playing multiplayer (Dont know how you would be) you could play the campain or play some of the show cases. 10/10
9315	1	a	10/10 Would recommend to anyone! Great game and many things to do!
9317	1	a	Great game, if you are interested in having a Dayz like experience I would recommend downloading the Breaking Point mod.
9319	1	a	Arma 3 packs a full punch, improving on all aspects of Arma 2. From the weapon system, the flow of your character, or even the smallest thing such as your side mirrors and rear view mirrors in your car actually work. Pick this game up. You will not be disappointed.
9321	1	a	10 - Graphics 9.5 - Sound 10 - Gameplay 9.7 - Voice Acting 10 - Potential (Modding, and custom mission scenarios)  Overal this is a great game! 
9323	1	a	Best real life combat simulator hands down there is no better foot, land, air and sea Arma series does it like no other game I have played.  Player made addons and missions making this game stand like the leaning tower of pisa it may not be perfect but it does look and feel great.
9325	1	a	I have played the predecessors for a long, long time and always thought of them (although crooked) the games to end all games for me. Then ARMA 3 came along, and now I know that ARMA 2 and especially ARMA were good games, but far from being the nearly perfect games I made them out to be.  IÂ´m not on about realism, because it is a game after all. No game can ever come close to the real thing, and it would be a horrible game if it would. Think of realism as things like 'take a bullet to the head in game and never be able to play ever again'. What I AM on about is the level of immersion. That ARMA 3 can put you under real stress, can make you involuntarily shout out 'INCOMING!' or make you race for virtual cover, make you flinch and instill fear for your virtual life.  This time around, the experience is hindered by far fewer bugs and glitches than in any ARMA game ever. The inventory system has been reworked, vehicle and aircraft physics have been improved, the engine has been rebuilt from scratch. All while retaining a 'feel' very much like ARMA 2. In essence, this game is the best ARMA ever released - improved on all fronts, no features lost in translation.  On top of the technical aspect, even though this game hasnÂ´t been live for a long time now, it has already been modded, customised and improved by the vast, loyal and savvy community, to a degree that ARMA 2 saw about 2-3 years after its release - and there is far, far more to come.  Can I recommend this game? Yes. Is it a game for everybody? No. But it is a game *everybody* should try. This has been the only game I have bought for full price (44.99 â‚¬) in years, and I donÂ´t regret a single cent spent. What are you still waiting for? get ARMA 3. It will be different from anything youÂ´ve ever played. Except ARMA 2.
9327	1	a	nothing to say,and Great Game. (i'm Speechless)
9329	1	a	10/10
9331	1	a	I have not played it, but looks cool. 10/10
9333	1	a	You can fight wiithout pants! my gawd best game ever 79 fishsticks out of 56 cakes
9335	1	a	This game has one of the most powerful graphics that has been seen in any game so far in a fps and survival etc game. No screen tearing, Hardly any graphics problems on terrain or sky etc.  This game is a 9.5/10 game, and will beat the bf4 and cod series if the developers concentrate on this game for the long term run. 
9337	1	a	its bloody crap fam
9339	1	a	Arma 3: is a good game but has it's bugs but over all and rilly good game
9341	1	a	I will rate this game very 5 ways VERY SPECIFICLLY:  1. 5 points for physics/ballistics (very life like) 2. 5 points for gameplay/style (if your looking for that real gritty down to earth COMBAT experiance this is your game) 3. 4 points for diversity ( from weps, vehicle, guns, its not too much and not too little. just right although perhaps a few more rifles) 4. 4 points for tactical (in order to be succesful you must work as a team in this game, i didnt give it 5 because of the lack of communication quality between squads) 5. 1 point for optimization( HORRIBLE HORRIBLE optimization. Good or bad pc we all basically get the same level of performance wth higher end pc's pbvoiusly getting a LITTLE TINY bit better performance)   this is the major flaw which can kill this game for some. FORTUNATLY for ME i have a pretty powerful rig so i can opt out 31-37 fps in cities with 75+ people online. which in all honesty is RIDICULOUS but boehemia is what it is.   MY HONEST OPINION:  If you sick of disney-like run and gun war games liek BF4 or COD and want a more real play experience \, i'd reccomend this game HIGHLY.   +=+WARNING+=+ If you think you are going to get amazing graphics AND above 40 FPS (LOL) you are either nuts or rich. You WILL need the TOP OF THE LINE n i mean at least $2500 rig to run this game MAX at 60fps. but you can still run it at Mediumhighish and hope to get 30fps.   well good luck and make the best descision.
9343	1	a	Before i start this i want to say this a great game. best game i have but.. They are asking for money all these DLC's. This game is't cheap, and they are asking for all these 3 dlc's thats out, and APEX will cost too?! Anyways it's a good game.
9345	1	a	Fantastic game. Full or suprises and great realism!
9347	1	a	best game ive played in a while , needs some optimization but its good
9349	1	a	Awesome game countless hours of gameplay and theres always something new to experience.
9351	1	a	10/10 great game, would do again -IGN
9353	1	a	Played Altis Life, Smoked Weed, Got Arrested, 10/10
9355	1	a	Great to play!
9357	1	a	THEYRE GONNA RELEASE THIS GAME WITH 64BIT EXECUTABLES HOLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9359	1	a	This game is great! It is its own category of games and is like no other. Its one of the best Military simulators I have ever played. It has a great community and many people dedicated to it! 10/10
9361	1	a	It's a very good game and lots of fun, especially with some of the mods you can download.
9363	1	a	Great game!
9365	1	a	Very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all
9367	1	a	THE BEST GAME
9369	1	a	Played it a litle it wasn't bad
9371	1	a	Definetly a very fun game. The recent DLC that they released, Apex, I think is slightly over priced, and you should wait for the price to go down or for it to go on sale, but it's also worth it. A lot of work went into this game and is a lot of fun with friends. There are a lot of awsome mods for this game that really add to this game's worth, as well as a lot of fun life servers. But it can get kind of lonely without friends to play with, so defnetly consider that. I would give it a 9/10.
9373	1	a	It's a very good game and lots of fun, especially with some of the mods you can download.
9375	1	a	arma 3 is for scrubs. joe is a â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10 wouldn buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again
9377	1	a	this is the game i got a pc for and im so glad i did.it looks amazing and.there are a lot of buttons to get use to but u can just use basic buttons to get started and learn on the fly.the battle royal mod is worth the price alone.cant say enuff good about this game.get it 
9379	1	a	This is a superb game! I have played it for years and I highly recommend it!
9381	1	a	Definetly a very fun game.

9383	1	a	Like this game. It's one of the best game's i've ever played!! +rep
9385	1	a	A very good game.Thx Bohemia
398	0	a	I would reccommend this game to anyone who wants to play arma life or wasteland however if you want to play for the millitary simulator aspect of the game i wouldnt recommend it you will find the majority of the servers are arma life wastland and epoch ect. there are a few servers and if you want to play for the realism i would recommend invade and annex as you work together as a team to accoplish objectives against the AI. also it is pay to win there is content in the game which you can not use in multiplayer matches such as sniper rifles and helicopters without purchasing the DLC i understand they need to make money however i beleive they should develop the game to make more maps and encourage people to buy the game as there is only two maps in the game (without spending Â£25 on the expansion and getting one map and some extra content) and the terrian is quite simular. also infantry is more obsolete due to most vecheials having thermal vision and being able to spot infantry much easier however if you want to play life ect. i would recommend however from my point of view this game is a waste of money (i have also brought the marksmen DLC at first to invest in the company to hope they might bring out some more maps and more content however my funding has gone towards APEX which i would have to buy for Â£25) remember this is not a rant this is just to help people decide on the purchase on this game.
9387	1	a	Fantastic game in my opinion. Definetly requires friends to play with. If you're looking for a hardcore shooter, look no further than BECTI hardcore arma 3 servers. Rolling in transport choppers with entire squads of players rappeling down with armor being lifted AND Close air support is the exciting and fun. I give a solid 9.5/10, I only give the 9.5 because of the fact that there are still some bugs that can cause crazy things to happen (Such as a tiny one foot high post blowing up my armored car)
9389	1	a	Two thumbs up
9391	1	a	Visual Quality - 10 (Outstanding) Gameplay Mechanics - 9 (This may not feel like your average first person shooter.. Slower paced then most mainstream shooters, The controls feel solid and actually shooting someone feels increasingly satisfying. Also the game will slowly force you into using a more planned and strategic tactic when facing your target, as using the 'Run &amp; Gun' tactic will get you killed in this War simulator.) Multiplayer - 6.5 (Poor Performance drives away the whole experience.) Sound - 8 (Although clumsy at times, Some sound effects may postively enhance your experience.)  I would definately recommend this game.
9393	1	a	Arma 3 is fun
9395	1	a	Kids play COD, youth play BF, men play ArmA. 5/5 would glitch and fly to the sky and die again.
400	0	a	this game is slowly dying along with its servers very hard to get into, and just not worth the price  refunded
9397	1	a	Arma 3 is good game, but its not like common run and shoot game like COD or BF. Since Arma 3 was made more like a simulator than a normal game, the controls is a bit spesific. You wouldnt understand it if not played it before, but you will learn it quite fast.  The graphics is great, but not the best. the details though is very well done.   The gameplay: Arma 3 is a game you will probably either love or hate. In the sigleplayer you get to do almost whatever you would like to. From diving and desarming mines to defending towns in badass helicopters. the multiplayer can also be amazing. Team up with a couple of friends and you got it! Thats some hours you will probably never regret spending.  Now, there are som bugs and all of that, but screw them! If you like detailed and huge maps Arma 3 is for you. If you like realstic shooters Arma 3 is for you. And if you love having a good time with friends driving around in various vehicles mowing down stuff, this game is deffinitly for you!
401	0	a	The Sims of fps-me A good concept ruined by dlc that should been in the game since launch or free.
402	0	a	I want to like this, but I just can't. The controls aren't nearly intuitive enough, especially switching through the aiming modes, which seem to only work half the time with no explanation? The campain starts by putting red squares around the enemy, then without explanation completely drops this behavior, leaving you to have to visually locate and identify the enemy that are camo'ed and prone all around you, all while they can spot you from miles away and snipe you to death without you even knowing where they were. I gave up after the guy I was following was blown up and have no desire to return to this mess of a game. Maybe the mods/multiplayer are better, but the campain start is such utter crap I can't even bring myself to keep this installed.
403	0	a	This game is a HUGE improvement over ARMA 2 in terms of the engine and its looks, graphically. The game works much better than the second installment of the series, and is much easier to use. But, the game's setting has completely ruined it for me, I really dont appreciate what bohemia did moving the setting to 2034/2035. I really loved the setting of 1990-early 2000s ARMA 2 provided, and i dont feel that ARMA 3 provides a very immersive feel (For me, anyways) I'm sure there are mods to change the game for the more cold war 'feel'. But i havnt found many that are what i want.
9399	1	a	This game is one that is either love it or hate it in regards to the original, unmodded game and it's concept. It's realistic and while people call it a 'running simulator' in real gameplay modes unlike Wasteland where you start with a good set of military assets, you only have to run for long distances unless you wrecked 4 vehicles and don't have friends in a squad to pick you up or to respawn on.   Here is the easiest way to explain the concpet of this game, look at a game where you fight in a plane, stuff like Star Fox and Crimson ties are arcadey, gamey takes on this, then there are combat flight sims that are in-depth, thoughtful, and inforgiving as well as realsitic as hell. This game is basically the flight simualtor approach to the concept of a Battlefield game, where military infantry, land, sea, and air units fight in a very large environment with a lot of units at once in a game session. Except this has very in-depth coop and singleplayer unlike Battlefield.   It's not for everyone, but for those who always wanted there sooter game's guns and vehicles to feel more realsitic, who wanted strategy, tactics, and thoughtful choice of action to be more important than in arcadey military shooters, and who wanted a military experience over a hollywood, michael bay interpretatino of a military experience like in CoD and BF. This is the game for you.   Developer support is great, new DLC and patches that actually help are regular occurences.  Mod support is arguably the best in all of gaming, offering anything from new experiences like zombie survival to post apocalyptic warfare to doubling and greatly expanding the amount of guns, vehicles, units, and gameplay mechanics available all for free through playermade content heavily supported by the developer, a modding contest with a large pool of prize money is even comnfirmed by the dev.   9/10  Some tips for potential buyers:  -If you are new to Arma, play the 'bootcamp' campaign first, that gives you a tutorial to teach it's unique and pretty complex mechanics and controls, this will make it much easier and less frustrating to learn.  -Never use Vsync in the in-game menu, it causes frame drops and sluggishness, adaptive Vsync via gpu driver software may be a better option  -Never put view distance over 2500 meters, most mp servers lock it too 1600 meters maximum anyway (and override your settings) and anything longer distance than 2500 is not optimized and is meant to be enjoyed by future machines who easily overpower the game.  -For specs, 8+ gb of DDR3 RAM and a modern CPU with a high clock speed is most important, you only need a mid grade video card to run things on high and medium with a distance below 2500 and vsync off, and having more than 4 cores in a CPU matters very little, but clock speed does, I'd say at least 3.5 Ghz for over 30fps.  -Don't expect to fully understand or master the game anytime soon and expect to be challenged a lot, if you do so, you'll get a rewarding experience that others wanting instant gratification (which is fine, but just not what Arma is good at) may find frustrating.  Hope this helps, as an Arma maniac I want to steer peopel who won't like this game away from buying it as much as I want people who would like it to put their money down.
407	0	a	this game needs work on some of its finer functions such as difficulty aiming and lag time as well as sensitivity.
408	0	a	Don't buy this game unless you're willing to pay more money for a game you already payed for.  The game has the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥est marketing system I have ever seen, you have to pay $70 just to get it and an extra $20 to be able to use half the guns in the game, you would have thought its original hefty price tag would have been enough.  Other than that it's a good game.
409	0	a	The last of the 'Arma''s series...  What to say? A great 'technical' game, a really poor overall display.  Not fun: buggy AI, dull mission, difficult controlling of vehicles, not so many vehicles, not so many good (and bug free) mod...  It's Arma 2, with some improvments and better graphic...  Really disappointing.
9401	1	a	This game. this game is ballayoloswag420
9403	1	a	As someone who plays Wasteland a lot. You either live long enough to be the person to kill fresh spawns, or you die quick enough to become the fresh spawn a lot.
9405	1	a	its so good add a f15 f16 and c17s
410	0	a	dlc that should be free or 1/5 the price, I used to love this game but the price of dlc and the size of what you get, back to the drawing board you ruin this game by taking to long to release new content and over charge for it, I'll buy another 4 pack of terraria at least their content updates are free and don't get kicked from every second match because you refuse to pay for over priced extra content
411	0	a	this game has constant DLC in order to play, Bohemia Interactive is becoming like EA. I could play with certain mods, and now this Apex DLC came out, I cannot use certain mods without buying the DLC. Please dont support Bohemia Interactive, as they just strive for money and not customer satisfaction
9407	1	a	10/10. Would walk 6km and get one-shotted again.
9409	1	a	Awesome,simply the ultimate military simulation. Fantastic graphics and visual and pure realism. Incredible weapons feedback and perfect accuracy of balistic and physical.  Many awesome user missions such as: Altis life RPG, Wasteland and many more .   
412	0	a	Graphics are pretty shocking and the tutorial is very simplistic but when you begin the first mission there is little help regarding what to do. As a soldier you're left to your own devices and to complete goals solo. Yet some of the goals aren't clear.  Not sure if it's just my old PC but if you're running windows 7 you may have a rough time as I found myself constantly lagging which heightened my annoyance.   I personally would not recomend this game to anyone and I can 100% guarantee I will not be buying the full version of this game. 
9411	1	a	This the tactical shooter you deserve. Buy this game along with Apex and all the add-ons.  Arma 3 doesn't dissapoint.
9413	1	a	This is defenently a work in proggress but with a leap in animations from Arma 2 but still requires jets, planes and more variety of cars and classes with an ability to customize your firearm
413	0	a	This game is hands down the best shooter ever made. It is a very immersive game that has features that make it feel like real life. You get injured and if you heal you will walk slower, carry too much and you won't be able to move, realistic stamina, etc. The amount of weapons and vehicles is nice but nowhere near the competitors. Yet those few weapons have the most realistic damage and ballistics of any game I've played.  Now after seeing that you are probably asking why I didn't suggest this game to others. Well the game has a lot of cool features and is very promising in all the different ways you can play. But the game is unplayable at times and is very unreliable. In single player a $2000 dollar computer will run at 40-50 fps on all maxed out video settings. (That being one of the major faults of the game itself; a game shouldn't require two to three thousand dollars for a computer to run single player at subpar frame rates.) That same single player also has one of the worst AI systems in a game. If you're in the line of fire prone with your group of guys they will shoot you to get to the enemy. This happens more often than you would think, and itâ€™s such a problem your squad mates will often kill each other. The enemy AI is far superior in combat and you will find yourself leaving your AI squad behind so you can actually accomplish missions because they tend to get the attention of the enemy AI which seems to target you first no matter what. The enemy AI can see you through bushes 800m away crawling through the 3ft tall grass. So if you want a stealth shooter go somewhere else. In fact if you want a better AI and squad experience go buy the original Ghost Recon because it had a better AI and squad system than this game.   WHO CARES ABOUT SINGLE PLAYER JOHN!   Ok then, so you give up on the single player and you go to multiplayer expecting a similar experience without having to worry about the AI. You'll start up a moderate sized 40 man server that has a ping of 30 when you join that is about full and your system will bog down to 10-15 fps. You go around a corner checking for enemies in a town and you won't be able to move your gun fast enough and you'll get owned over and over. If you try to be in a vehicle with a person who has a junk computer, good luck seeing anything.  All in all, great features on a horrible performance platform, and to make up for it you need a server for a computer. 
9415	1	a	Oh Arma....what do I say about you? You have given me some of the most satisfying video gaming of my life. Theres nothing quite like being dropped into a hot AO with tracers lighting up the sky as you dive out of the chopper and run like your â™¥â™¥â™¥ is on fire to the first available cover. After ten minutes of trading fire with an enemy squad 700 meters away, you run up on some poor  CSAT ba$tard ten feet away and you both frantically try to switch from semi- to full auto fire and take each other down. After 30-40 minutes of tense, frantic combat with your squadmates who actually want to win and survive and not just be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the enemy town is clear, and you pop some cool colored smoke and have a dance party while waiting for the exfil chopper. Halfway to the next area of operations, an enemy jet screams by and blows out your helicopter's main drive rotor. As you and ten other of your fellow soldiers plummet towards the ground in a flaming mess, the pilot screams out over voice chat: 'I'M SORRY BOYS, I LOVE ALL OF YOUUUUUU!'  Boom.  Dead.  I love this game. It has a steep-a$$ learning curve but you will feel like a hard, tough, deadly warrior when you figure it out.  10/10  EDIT: 64bit is a game changer
9417	1	a	THIS is an AWESOME game to play. The developer team is really caring about the community. The workshop and map editor helps you to do a LOT of things that no other games can. The hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. PLUS, if you one of those people who play COD or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to L2P this game. ARMA 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the AI is pretty good at aiming). Stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.
9419	1	a	I love this game
9421	1	a	This is 1 of the best games i ever played, its so realistisc and evrything whit it is good!
9423	1	a	  so much fun. a good friend gifted this to me and only a few hours in and its so fun! you should try it
9425	1	a	Now, with almost 700 hours on Arma i would say that this game has so much replay value to it. Arma 3 is a Army Shooter Simulation. The campaign is excellent, including all addons and mods on the steam workshop are FREE and Arma releases their OWN addons. Overall, its a great game all around where you can use teamwork, play against each other competitivly, or join a unit to get the full experience of a Military Suimultion out of Arma. At it's current stage i recommend this 100% Great Buy :D
9427	1	a	ArmA III, a product by the company in which has been the start of my gaming days. ArmA III offers a new atmosphere to the gaming community with countless diffrent modding communities, diffrent maps to choose from, and a long list of game modes such as Survival, Zombie Survival, Roleplaying, Military Simulation, and much more. New game modes are always being made and overall the game its self is worth it becuase it has an endless line of fun and variation.
9429	1	a	Great to play with friends. Awesome support from the community with mods and players alike.
9431	1	a	Awesome,simply the ultimate military simulation. Fantastic graphics and visual and pure realism. Incredible weapons feedback and perfect accuracy of balistic and physical.  Many awesome user missions such as: Altis life RPG, Wasteland and many more .   
9433	1	a	10/10. Would walk 6km and get one-shotted again.
9435	1	a	Great game! Need a very good rig to run with decent fps online though. Servers stack memory causing FPS issues in multiplayer sometimes. But this game is another Arma classic and is absolutley gorgeous.
9437	1	a	Rate 9/10  Hi there!Personally i believe that all Arma series games are just perfect and they deserve every single dollar you pay for them.Very nice graphics,Ultimate battle simulation,mods supported,perfect gameplay and much more.... the only minus is the poor optimazation in some PC's... that they dont have a decent cpu-gpu combination....
9439	1	a	Perfect game!
9441	1	a	I don't know how to write a game review, so I'm going to show my favorite Fish Pie recipe  Ingredients  400g skinless white fish fillet 400g skinless smoked haddock fillet 600ml full-fat milk 1 small onion , quartered 4 cloves 2 bay leaf 4 egg small bunch parsley , leaves only, chopped 100g butter 50g plain flour pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1kg floury potato , peeled and cut into even-sized chunks 50g cheddar , grated   Method  Poach the fish. Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the milk. Stud each onion quarter with a clove, then add to the milk, with the bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil â€“ you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish. Hard-boil the eggs. Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil, then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil, with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins, cook, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel, slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish, then scatter over the chopped parsley. Make the sauce. Melt half the butter in a pan, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little of the cold poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bringto the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then pour over the fish. Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil the potatoes for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining butter and milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in â€“ push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle with cheese, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins.
9443	1	a	Beautiful graphics, massive scale (terrain is huge and PLENTY of weapons and vehicles to use). The game has a growing mod support, gametypes like Wastland, Battle Royale, King of the Hill and Domination gives the game a big lifespan, where boredom is a hard thing to find. The requirements are a bit demanding, but with an old phenom processor and GTX 660, I run the game fine.
9445	1	a	Not much i can say one of the best games i have played
9447	1	a	If you like playing games at low fps, this game is for you.        No joke lol.
9449	1	a	If you are the type of person that likes military shooters and/or Milsim, this is the game for you. Great graphics, but slow at times. Mulitplayer fps is not the best. But this game is VERY CPU dependant. I reccomend this game if you have a good pc
9451	1	a	supeer funny and super realistic
9453	1	a	Remember when driving into a chicken-wire fence would blow up your car around 60% of the time?  Let's bring those days back.
9455	1	a	Buy it now :)

9463	1	a	best milsim of all times. period
9465	1	a	This game is hands down one of the best experiences you can get on a PC. The gameplay is amazing and the amount of great mods is breathtaking.
9467	1	a	Fun and epic game.
9469	1	a	For the little I played, this is definitive game for military simulation lovers.   It has some bugs, but the game is great and offers TONS of customizations and options to make it your own. A word of advice: You will never learn what is to play Arma if you are alone. So get an unit, soldier!  10/10
9471	1	a	Intel 2 Cores 2 Thread = 10 fps 2 Cores 4 Threads = 11 fps 4 Cores 4 Threads = 40 fps 4 Cores 8 Threads = 80 fps 8 Cores 16 Threads = 140 fps AMD 2 Cores 2 Modules = Doesn't Run 2 Cores 4 Modules = 12 fps 4 Cores 4 Modules = 20 fps 4 Cores 8 Modules = 22 fps  Solution to good gaming experience in arma 3. Waste $3,000 on a decent PC.
9473	1	a	Arma 3 is a really nice simulator. I really like the custom content here and this simulator is definitely going places.
9475	1	a	lITTLE BUGGY, BUT GREAT FUN.
425	0	a	More complicated than an instruction book from Ikea.
9477	1	a	This game is outstanding it has so much more things u can do in it and its only in beta right now. So i can just imagine how good it will be when it comes out fully. 
9479	1	a	good game but my pc is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :/
9481	1	a	Won my first Arma 3 BR, 15th Oct. feelsgoodman, great game.
9483	1	a	I SUCK AT THIS GAME!
9485	1	a	  This is a good GAME!!!
9487	1	a	People realize this game is a MILSIM and developed for it! Exile and Altis Life are modifications and don't blame BI that they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed your server isn't their fault. BI creating a game for military simulations not a dayz or altis life there is other games to play if you want exile buy DayZ if you want Altis life go play smth else but this game is for military simulation and don't cry!
9489	1	a	Uhh, what button do I click to send this review? 10/10 game, must buy
9491	1	a	Great game! Though, I do recommend to someone that is considering buying this game to have a 'somewhat decent' PC to play it. It's no fun playing a shooting game when you can barely even shoot accurately due to having bad performance!
9493	1	a	Best mil sim so far. And besides that, you can have fun in the rpg servers.  Bad side is if you really wanna fully enjoy the game, you have to buy all the dlcs, and the latest Apex dlc is like 27 bucks.
9495	1	a	I have a lot to say about this game and not a lot of time to say it.  Soldiers of the future are kinda dumb but the mods make it cool, AI are immune to pain and they can headshot you from the Greek island of Altis all the way to you sitting at your actual computer.  I like RHS, pretty fun. Uhhh, join my milsim unit.
9497	1	a	This game is extreamly addicting, fun, and diverse... And the maps are HUGE!!!
9499	1	a	you should buy it    Yankee Oscar Lima Oscar
9501	1	a	Its a good game, great community. I have played it a while.... just a bit to..... test things out
9503	1	a	OMG THIS GAME!!!!  BUY IT IMMEDIATELY because with this game you gona play a lot! A well done game focused on pure realism and made for the players in mind!  It has a great game engine you never seen before, everything in the game is simulated. the guns, the bullets, the choppers, tanks,trucks,soldiers etc.  It is a tripla A title based on multiple real life islands the biggest is 270km2 wide with astonishing deatils!  And if you get bored with the original game, theres tons of mods you can play.And dont get me started on the multiplayer part wohooo, its really where the game shines!Tons of players online everyday, and top tier servers available for you without paying any addinational fees.  If every game could be this well made, we wouldnt have enough time to live our lifes....
9505	1	a	 My experience with the game     over 1350 hours    mainly played with realism units    have spent a lot of time mission making and modding    Positives
9507	1	a	Arma Arma Arma.   Live like the original U.S.A Soldier Life.
9509	1	a	Excellant game, great graphics and physics
9511	1	a	You don't have it already? Just get it. It's the best thing on Steam, hands down.
9513	1	a	if you seek a big community this game is not for you. 6000+ Servers with about 500 players online a day, scattered around. Give or take 50 to 100 people. So you have 5000+ Dead servers up with 0 players. Game probably use to be active, now the community is dead.  I would not recommend this game if you seek company. If you like playing by yourself, i recommend this game.
9515	1	a	-Plays battle royal, Survives hour and a half with good loot, gets in truck, drives into bush, truck stops working, gets out, truck explodes.- 10/10 so realistic.

435	0	a	This is a waste of money. You'd think it would be good, but it isn't. It has all the pieces of a good game, but lacks emotion, even for a sandbox.
436	0	a	The most boring game ever!
9517	1	a	'Dude, get in the car' 'Hang on. What is that weird sound'................... 'IT'S A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BATTLE TANK!!!! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING RUN!!!!'
9519	1	a	Did not buy for military simulation experience. Bought to dress up as priest and role play with other like minded idiots. Was not disappointed. Would recommend.
9521	1	a	For the little I played, this is definitive game for military simulation lovers.   It has some bugs, but the game is great and offers TONS of customizations and options to make it your own. A word of advice: You will never learn what is to play Arma if you are alone. So get an unit, soldier!  10/10

439	0	a	Possibly the worst game created so far, even compared to really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ indie titles. This game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. If you run intel anything you'll be fine, but god forbid that you run AMD you'll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. The developers for this game are autistic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue 'It's a simulator, not a game' but it's still a 'Military Simulator'. There is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥torm of a simulator. All the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where they're supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shooting nerf guns at nothing.   TL;DR Pros: It's a game  Cons: It's a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game Low/nonexistant FPS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gunplay Models are ugly Server list sucks  Just about every game out there is better than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and that's terrible seeing as there's a full dev team that made this.  Just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, that's all there is to it.
440	0	a	This game runs poorly on new, state of the art systems. I honestly wish I didn't even buy it. I spent hours trying to get the game to run on my 6700k and gtx 1080, and in the end requested a refund, that was denied because I spent more than two hours trying to make it work. Gpu boosting is terribly implemented, with underclocking in game unless zoomed in. People will tell you that the framerate depends on your cpu, but while zoomed in and the gpu boosts, the framerate is almost playable. As far as the game, get use to getting shot at and killed by people you never see. The game is a frustrating technical mess, that the programmers optimized with the proficiency of a potato.
9541	1	a	So this one is a weird one. On the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. It is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic FPS. The game also looks pretty dang good,  On the other hand this game screams BETA, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. For example bi-pod integration still hasnÂ´t been going in. That alongside the DLC being added even though the game is extremely unpolished.   Simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10  p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!
9543	1	a	this is the game i got a pc for and im so glad i did.it looks amazing and.there are a lot of buttons to get use to but u can just use basic buttons to get started and learn on the fly.the battle royal mod is worth the price alone.cant say enuff good about this game.get it 
9545	1	a	Amazing game! I've put over a 100 hours in this game mostly in the Editor and it still has me coming back for more. The mod support for this game is also freaking awesome with evrything I could ever ask for and more! The campainge isn't the best but the multiplayer is everything a tactical shooter should be.
9547	1	a	  wish i could play this game, if anyone wants to help a poor child in africa pls gift me this game
9549	1	a	Buy this game. 20/10
9551	1	a	I would recommend this game to CoD players
9553	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game with a steep learning curve. If you are willing to put in the time, then you will have a great time playing this game; you will make friends, enemies, memes and everything in between playing on servers. I'd recommend bring an irl friend along for the wild ride that is Arma Epoch/Exile/Overpoch and building a base. Great Game - 5/7
9555	1	a	Great game if you have the patience to play it, but has quite a few bugs/glitches.
9557	1	a	Really fun 
9559	1	a	Love this game with a passion, there's so many things you can do and I've spent nearly 1K hours on it with both my accounts together I can highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys open world roleplay or playing tactical
9561	1	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate this game yet I'd buy every single DLC made.
9563	1	a	its cool
9565	1	a	I've been running for an hour in this game

9571	1	a	Very good game if you like to rolepay.
444	0	a	 https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Analytics   Opt-out and not Opt-in. There is no prompt to inform the user of this while launching the game.  PSA: 'Anonymous Data' doesn't exist.    UPDATE 07/11/2016
9573	1	a	A very good game. Admittedly I haven't played it very much since Counter Strike took me and didn't let go. However, if you are looking for a good military simulator game with a intresting campaign and fantastic multiplayer, this is it. Play PlayerUnknowns battle royale, it is a classic and where I have spent ~75% of my play time.
446	0	a	Having spent about 1,000 hours on Arma2/OA (between D2D/Disk Version/Steam) and 70 hours in Arma 3, it's no contest in anything but graphics. Arma2/OA is much better in terms of realism. The bullet sponge AI in Arma3 (sorry body armor doesn't let you just keep trucking like it was a bee sting) just kill any immersion whatsoever along with the ridiculous fantasy Iranian units. Also simple things like the 'flying' drop down when placing units are gone in the new editor for no apparent reason.  Overall Arma 3 does look a lot better, but still runs pretty poorly regardless of high end hardware (i7 960@4.1Ghz+STRIX R9 390X/ 3930K@4.2Ghz+STRIX GTX 1060/ i7 4770K@4.3Ghz+780Ti MATRIX SLI (previously 290X MATRIX CF and 390X STRIX CF) / i7 6700@stock+GTX 1070FE / i7 5930K@4.5Ghz+STRIX 980Ti SLI (previously 780Ti MATRIX SLI).   Rather than wasting time on a dubious futuristic setting it would have been far better for the developers to focus on quashing performance issues and providing a believable simulation with realistic damage based on impact point+round+angle. Also AI is still very dumb and STILL unable to haul @$$ with a sense of urgency.   I see Arma 3 as a downhill slide for the series, being far more casual than previous iterations in terms of attempted realism compounded by unwillingness to expand the core mechanics for realism that had been laid down since OPFP. In a way it's more like the Battlefield version of the series.  Also on the campaigns; they are straight up trash. Resistance and Red Hammer have not been bested to date, although the Arma 2 campaign was pretty fun. Arma 3 is just a slog of monotony; APEX is a waste of money.
9575	1	a	shot my friends helicopter and it leaked all its fuel  10/10
9577	1	a	it is worth buying
449	0	a	I've gotten this game out of spite from many youtube videos and mods. I've paid money so you can save yours. This is why ArmA 3, Armed Assault 3/Armed Assault III isn't so great.  BattlEye: *shiver* don't even get me started on this false positive piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lol.  Optimization: Warframe = Max settings, runtime tesselation on my AMD Athlon II X3 455 and Radeon HD 7770 Factory OC 60 - 75 fps ArmA 3 = Lowest settings possible same specs as above 13-*20-30* depending on map, level and the server  * mostly Also, graphics don't affect â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you don't have a 'perfect build'  Gameplay: Could fix a few things like standing up when crawling over rocks. Overall, not too shabby.  Mods: Prepare your HDD/SSD space gentlemen. Half the 'realism' or 'USA/RU' content is 500 - 3000 MB Oh yeah, remember optimization? You'll love it with mod optimization too.  Community: Everyone plays Altis Life or Island Life or basically RP those who don't play it play insurgency/ctf stuff but there's a small percent who play 'realism' squads. I've attempted this, good guys, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ experience. CHATLOG: Kawurftha: mfw playing realism with this group I recently joined Kawurftha: &gt;i die Kawurftha: &gt;they don't let me respawn Kawurftha: &gt;i've been waiting for 1 1/2 hours Kawurftha: &gt;they are finally almost done Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 'Because you don't respawn in real life' Oh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'm sorry I didn't realize banding all your wounds no matter what and injecting morphine instantly cures everything in real life? *cringe*  Graphics: Could be improved, pretty good overall but see optimization.  Overall: 4.5/10 Now I hear you ArmA people saying 'WOAH WOAH WOAH SUM1'S ANGRY THE CAN'T RUN ARMA!!! SO THEY GIVE BAD REVIEW!!!!' No, Your just too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to realize that BIS isn't gonna fix optimization Not just that, but 66.49 CAD? FOR A FULL GAME IN 2015? THIS ISN'T THE 1950s. Warframe is free and it runs better than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and I can max it. 'b00t teh warframe is missions not open wurld' I mean Warframe has a pretty big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing view distance (I so think) Warframe would probably still run better than ArmA if it was open world.      I'm still gonna play this game every now and then though.
450	0	a	now i really want to thumbs up this game but i just cant unless u have an amazing pc most game modes especially king of the hill will run at 10-20 fps i dont have a bad computer it rund far cry 4 on ultra at 40-50 fps but this game will only frustrate u if u dont have a really expensive pc ....... i loved it personaly with its team based tatics and damage model yet whn ur in the war zone it lags so much so thts y i dont thumbs up this game
451	0	a	Not worth 60$
9579	1	a	If you want a game where you can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around and have fun then this is it.
9581	1	a	The bible is wrong, Arma has proven the evolution, because you can see fish walking on land
9583	1	a	Very good game if you like to rolepay.
452	0	a	This game has pretty good looking graphics. The options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. The controls are overcomplicated. Ragdoll physics is horrible. But the game is trying to be more tactical like,well its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like 'Hey! Look at me! Shoot me!'. Playing alone isn't to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of Arma 3. The maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploring,pretty cool if you enjoy exploring. The vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. The air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the Armas.(BTW still don't know how to use air vehicles). Is this a full release or a beta? I do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. Like when that time I shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. This game is 4/10 hard to recommend.
9585	1	a	Beautiful graphics, massive scale (terrain is huge and PLENTY of weapons and vehicles to use). The game has a growing mod support, gametypes like Wastland, Battle Royale, King of the Hill and Domination gives the game a big lifespan, where boredom is a hard thing to find. The requirements are a bit demanding, but with an old phenom processor and GTX 660, I run the game fine.
9587	1	a	First of all,  THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  If you like military games, realistic stuff, vehicles, big map, pvp (There is much more). This game is for you. If your bored of doing missions, you can always go and play other gamemode like, King of the hill in which there are three teams and one town and the team who can hold off the town for the longest wins. There is altis life in which you make money by selling drugs/ mining etc. and then spend the money on stuff, you can rob people, gas stations and become a cop (RP). Its a really fun game to play.  I would rate it  9.5/10  because of some fails in the game's mechanics, its still a really fun game to play with friends or alone.
9589	1	a	Real War ;3
9591	1	a	Not much i can say one of the best games i have played
9593	1	a	One hell of a good time!
9595	1	a	Overall this game is very realistic,fun and tactical ideal to play with friends; This game is solely for people who love Military Simulation and Realsim please if you are one of these people I only have one thing to say. GET THIS GAME! :D
9597	1	a	I may not have even played 10 hours of this game at the time I am writing this review but  THIS GAME IS SPLENDID.
9599	1	a	Kids play COD, youth play BF, men play ArmA. 5/5 would glitch and fly to the sky and die again.
458	0	a	this game is slowly dying along with its servers very hard to get into, and just not worth the price  refunded
9601	1	a	10/10 they fixed (for the most part) the optimization issues. I am now able to play at a stable FPS.
9603	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

465	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ optimization.(gtx 780)
466	0	a	unoptimized game with overpriced dlcs
9613	1	a	Well, why should you buy this game?  If you think you've seen some glitches in your time of playing games, then this is going to raise the bar a bit higher.
9615	1	a	A very good game. Admittedly I haven't played it very much since Counter Strike took me and didn't let go. However, if you are looking for a good military simulator game with a intresting campaign and fantastic multiplayer, this is it.

9617	1	a	When i die i feel like rubbing sand paper in and out my â™¥â™¥â™¥.....10/10 for the pain
9619	1	a	its cool
9621	1	a	There is just so much to do in the ARMA series that if you're a fan of first person shooters, there really is no reason not to have this simulation in your library. I may be a little bias since I've loved the ARMA series since the very early days of ARMA 2, but there is also very little not to love in any ARMA simulation. If the base game just isn't enough for you, there's also a few hundred mods you can install to make the experience funner and more immersive. I would recommend ARMA 3 to everyone, there is so many different roles to play offline and online it'd be hard for you to not be able to enjoy the sim and have some fun.
9623	1	a	Cant stop playing!
9625	1	a	Amazing game, with a detailed and epic campain sure to keep onself busy for a decent amount of time. the co-op is also epic, great to jam with friends. 10/10 would buy again.
9627	1	a	just a sphere moving around the screen.  More entertainment playing Pong.   10/10 spicy memes again
9629	1	a	Absolutely fantastic and never played before game. This game is a beast! I recommend this game with 9/10 Stars
9631	1	a	Very Tactical, Strategy, I've enjoyed this game way too much, I recommend it. You'll have way too much fun if you bring friends.
9633	1	a	very fun but cam be a very low fps game
475	0	a	Game was great until BattlEye launcher patch. Now I have a fucntional game that won't let me join any multiplayer servers because BattlEye won't work.   Deleted game and contents x2 with no fix.
476	0	a	After playing this game for a while, the dlc comes and the game still has horrible lag and bug issues.... They do not support the main mods for this game that actually keep the game alive. After about 2 years I have seen little improvement just more money dlc. Some of the glitchy deaths bugs have been around since Arma 2.. I would not buy at full price.. I bought this in alpha, and apparently it is still in alpha 
9635	1	a	I may not have even played 10 hours of this game at the time I am writing this review but  THIS GAME IS SPLENDID.
9637	1	a	Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience. If you want to get familiar with Arma's military machinery, you'll need to look to the showcase missions, download one of the many community-built scenarios out there, or jump into the enormous multiplayer. There are a vast range of multiplayer game modes to take your fancy. King of the Hill challenges three teams of 16 players to wrest control of a particular objective using small arms, tanks, helicopters, the works. If you're of a more co-operative bent, there are a range of developer missions that require teamwork to beat the odds, including the enormous Escape From Altis mission, which tasks your plucky group with safely reaching the coastline while avoiding the sights of a vastly superior enemy force.  Yet the most interesting of Arma's multiplayer modes stem from the community. Wasteland is a survival mode in a similar vein to DayZ, but without the zombies and with considerably more military equipment. Altis Life, meanwhile, eschews the focus on soldiers in favour of a cops-and-robbers scenario, where players tired of making money through picking fruit or mining ore club together to perform elaborate bank heists and player-police hunt them down. A lengthy paid alpha followed by six months of staggered campaign releases has given Arma 3's multiplayer an extraordinary range.  This is largely thanks to the fantastic foundation that is the island of Altis, which makes every mission, every multiplayer match, every combat engagement feel unique. There's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though, Arma 3's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges, but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.
9639	1	a	Sexy ambient, also lighting.
9641	1	a	Greatest slideshow ive ever seen!
9643	1	a	Arma 3, the continuation of the series by Bohemia. New players will love it, old players will love it. At the end of the day, it is still Arma, and it will still make you frustrated. But when it goes right, it's worth it. Even if it only goes right once.
9645	1	a	I wish DayZ would be this smooth.
477	0	a	This game was released in September 2013 without a single player campaign. Part 1 of 3 DLC s to add it was released in October. Its now Christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer, the final 2 DLCs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight....  It will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... Personally I do not.... My advice... save your money for something else.
9647	1	a	The quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game.  This aint arcadey casual rambo CoD or Battlefield rubbish folks. This is the real-world modelled experience every FPS player *should* be looking for. And if you haven't been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.
9649	1	a	Who needs more than one video game when ARMA 3 has mods?
9651	1	a	very good game its very good for misim and if you don't like that there are a lot more game modes to try
9653	1	a	With over a thousand hours on this game, I can say that Arma III is truly amazing. The first time I started playing this game I knew right then and there that I am going to be getting my money's worth. I was impressed on what was being shown right before my eyes when I launched the boot camp campaign tutorial. It was very immersive from the start and was that way until the end of the campaign. I recently joined a military realism/simulation unit because I wanted to get more experience in the game and learn more about the infantry before I am going to enlist in the Army. Joining this unit got me into modding this game.. alot. I will tell you this now, the game is completely different when you add a few mods. I would place this game as a nine out of ten itself, but adding mods as simple as subscribing to content from steam to downloading files from a website just breaks the scale, unlike many games. This game is capable of being a very basic training simulator in the military. Overall this is my favorite game in my steam library and most definitely recommend you get this game. I just cant wait to see whats in store for this game's future DLC's and feature to the Arma Series. Hoaah Bohemia, and HOAAH AMERICA!
9655	1	a	My fav thing to play when I want to cry and die at the same time.
9657	1	a	its lit
9659	1	a	it is worth buying
9661	1	a	When i die i feel like rubbing sand paper in and out my â™¥â™¥â™¥.....10/10 for the pain
9663	1	a	I pretty much only got this game to play Altis Life, which is a server mod for Arma III Multiplayer.  I tried out the single player mode, and as an ex-army man myself, I found the gameplay to be too over-realistic and died too many times. I'm sure if I had my peripheral vision and my best mates beside me, like I did in real life, then I'd survive a lot further in single player mode.  Altis Life on the other hand... I was a mad gansta motherf*cker!
9665	1	a	Altis Life: Walk into a town Get sniped in the head by rebel  Steals my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and calls me a â™¥â™¥â™¥ Respawn in Athira Get arrested for calling a cop a dumbass Get out of jail  Farm money from weed and cocaine Become rebel  Go to city Get shot in face by hacker  Called a â™¥â™¥â™¥  11/10 would recommend
9667	1	a	With over a thousand hours on this game, I can say that Arma III is truly amazing. The first time I started playing this game I knew right then and there that I am going to be getting my money's worth. I was impressed on what was being shown right before my eyes when I launched the boot camp campaign tutorial. It was very immersive from the start and was that way until the end of the campaign. I recently joined a military realism/simulation unit because I wanted to get more experience in the game and learn more about the infantry before I am going to enlist in the Army. Joining this unit got me into modding this game.. alot. I will tell you this now, the game is completely different when you add a few mods. I would place this game as a nine out of ten itself, but adding mods as simple as subscribing to content from steam to downloading files from a website just breaks the scale, unlike many games. This game is capable of being a very basic training simulator in the military. Overall this is my favorite game in my steam library and most definitely recommend you get this game. I just cant wait to see whats in store for this game's future DLC's and feature to the Arma Series. Hoaah Bohemia, and HOAAH AMERICA!
9669	1	a	My first Experience with Atlas Life Multiplayer-  1. Logged On 2. Cop pulls me over, asks if i am a criminal, then leaves 3. Second cop pulls me over and in the deepest voice imaginable says: YA KNOOW WERE TO BUY SOME DRUGGGGSS? Then leaves when he sees the other cop coming back. 4. A Cop pulls over a car near me, the guy gets out and shoots the cop without taking, then drives away 5. I steal the cop car 6. I get arrested 7. 2 mins later i am set free 8. Guy that killed the cop makes me join his gang 9. He buys me guns 10. He reveals he is the owner 11. We raid the police station 12. I die 13. I leave, stunned that all this happend it under 10 minutes.  10/10 Would become a Flabbergasted noob again.
9671	1	a	Love this game ! So many game modes and things to do when you get in to the game. have had alot of fun with friends on this :) Highly reccomend it :)
478	0	a	Awesome graphics and plot but game's playability is very low. Controls are very hard to use. You can not change them in the way you choose. It is the worst game I ever played for 4-5 years. Really annoying just because of controls. There are universal keys like 'T' for chat or 'Y' for team chat, they are totally different. And another problem is that Bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like DayZ. Another not recommended game for me.
479	0	a	I realize the Army's unofficial slogan is hurry up and wait. I didn't think developers would create a game completely embodying that statement.  I have never been so bored trying to play a game before. Keyword, trying, as once you actually get to the combat area (15-20 minutes after loading up this un-optimized mess) you get shot and have to redo the same process again.  0/10   Would not wait in a Humvee again.
480	0	a	DON'T BUY! OPTIMIZATION IS TERRIBLE!

9675	1	a	This game a dream come true for military enthusiast the combat is brutal a punishing some time I jump when I make unexpected contact with the enemy I find my self feeling real fear something I've ever felt playing a war game Arma 3 gets a 10/10 from me.
9677	1	a	This is as real as it gets for war games. If your looking for a good realistic game this is for you 10/10.
9679	1	a	Amazing game Love it so much :3
482	0	a	Yeah 10/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid, pay 40 dollars for the game no problem, goes to join a server = needs dlcs okay? Tried every server there is all need dlcs look there's an extra 50 bucks all up thanks Arma you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t system

9683	1	a	After the great Operation Flashpoint (Now Arma: Cold War Assault) the first two ArmAÂ´s where not THAT great, but still very good and I enjoyed playing them for a long time.  Arma 3 is my favourite part of the trilogy, thanks to a good and thrilling campaign (much better than CoD or BF) and the ArmA formula, that perfectly works now. AI does what you want, their aim is very good and they are very helpful. Enemy seeks cover and is a real threat, which makes the missions very thrilling. Like in the first three Rainbow Six or the first Ghost Recon.  The campaign feels very tense, like Operation Flashpoint or the Addon Resistance and I really enjoyed it.  The game runs perfect on my two year old PC and it is sure beautiful. The sound is also very good and the rifles donÂ´t sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere. Voice acting is great too. The controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you havenÂ´t played the other games of the series, but you get there with a little practice.  The new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons, put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear.  Overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and itÂ´s a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free.   Get it and enjoy it! :-)   
491	0	a	Outright unoptimised
9685	1	a	Arma 3, the continuation of the series by Bohemia. New players will love it, old players will love it. At the end of the day, it is still Arma, and it will still make you frustrated. But when it goes right, it's worth it. Even if it only goes right once.
9687	1	a	This is a great game it has beutiful graphics good gameplay. It makes me fell like im actuall in a real war.
9689	1	a	Greatest slideshow ive ever seen!
9691	1	a	Amazing game Love it so much :3
9693	1	a	You will never know a real game till you play this and learn to play it . 8/10 on game play 9/10 on gfx. love the game check it out.
9695	1	a	Cant stop playing!
9697	1	a	cooler than vape
9699	1	a	I hardly play Multiplayer, in any game, dunno why I just don't....ARMA 3 is one of the three games I player multiplayer in. Here's a story that    As part of a PMC team I deployed into a contested area to eliminate an HVT. Our chopper got shot up EXTREMELY bad, to the point where one pilot and both gunners were KIA and the remaining pilot was struggling to get it on the ground. We proceeded on foot and got savagely attacked, only after twenty minutes of trying to not die did a jet arrive and rake the area with bombs. Once the area was cleared we verified the HVT and stole a luxury car to escape.   Just...insane. The realism of ARMA 3 coupled with the fact that I was fighting alongside guys halfway across the world who were just as invested into the mission as I was made our plight that much more intense.   As a veteran of the ARMA series I can attest to the progress Bohemia has made in ARMA 3. Almost (ALMOST) everything I griped about in previous games were fixed...including some that actually made me stop playing for a while. I was a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at the lack of units at first, but then I remembered the crap-ton of user-made addons avalible in the Workshop and on Armaholic. I now have units from the cold war up to the Vanilla units of the future. I can play any war that I want and I can't think of any other game that can do that.   The island of Altis is HUGE, Stratis is pretty big but meh...it's a fruit fly compared to the Budgie of Altis (look up the difference, it's a suitable comparison...don't you judge me). There's a lot of space to destroy, with a variety of different areas allowing for different combat. You can do anything from marching across a shallow river to an intense firefight in a city.   The variety of fighting is outstanding. Being able to fight as a soldier, then go to a tank commander, then a gunship pilot, and a plane pilot, then to a special operator....it's outstanding. I've played in user-made campaigns where you literally cover every aspect of the war. To sum it up, it's like starring in a dozen war movies on your own.   If you've got patience and a desire to learn you can take a spin at the mission editor. It has a STEEEEEP learning curve, it'll require some serious investment to get good at. I've been playing these games for a while now and I STILL haven't mastered the editor (I'm good but I can't do some of the insane stuff others have). This allows for almost unlimited replayability, once you're done with the vanilla campaign and whatever custom ones you downloaded, you can simply hop into the editor and make your own!   Now time for the gripes  There's some aspects of the game that are...difficult to cusp, mostly in the editor. I feel like the game is actually all that finished yet, I won't go into detail about this but there's features that don't seem all quite there yet. I also don't appreciate minor DLC's being thrown out there with only a bit of content. I liked it better when Bohemia released a DLC with an entire new army and several new maps, like Operation Arrowhead (which was actually stand-alone), British Armed Forces, PMC, and Army of the Czech Republic. I haven't sunk any money into them because I'm holding out for 'ARMA 3 Pan-Asian War' or 'ARMA 3 World War III'...or, something of that strain....something with new armies, maps, and weapons instead of just a few new features. (To specify, I'm not saying that the DLC's are bad but I'm not willing to pay for them until something monumental comes out).  All in all this is an outstanding game without peer (say all you want about CoD and Battlefield, I love both franchises and have sunk many hours into their various incarnations, but they don't hold a candle to the glory of Armed Assault). If you're a serious gamer, this is your game. Military fan? This is your game. Modding fan? This is your game. Micro-transactions to restock energy and make moves? SCREW OFF AND GO BACK TO YOUR PHONE. You're not welcome here and we'd prefer if you kept your micro-transaction covered fingers out of our bowl of Steam.   Score, for those of you who like numbers and slashes (they get  my  motor running, something about it just really gets me riled up) 9/10  PS For those of you who had ARMA 2 there's a lot of ported content on the internet. I personally have the vanilla maps from ARMA 2 and its expansion packs. It's pretty damn cool going back to Takistan and Chernarus with the updated engine!

9711	1	a	Arma 3 is amazing! It has so many things for so many different people, its not just a milsim game its a role-playing game or a strategy game it is anything you wan't it to be. There is Altis Life or Life mod servers which are just RP and there is Milsim untis which are for the people who enjoy the military side of the game. It isnt just a shooter, its whatever you wan't it to be.
9713	1	a	I love the editor in this game, the only limitation is your imagination. Plus this game offers a lot of mods that from the workshop or on websites. The game looks amazing and the maps are HUGE! I give this game a 9/10. If you like building your own battlefield and having vurtually unlimited customization,then this game is for you.

499	0	a	Yes, this is the fanciest milsim(actually it's mostly a walking/driving/looking for only-god-and-thermal-scopes-know-where-they-are enemies simulator) you can find out there, but -  AI can't get more stupid, vanilla weapons can't get uglier, dlcs can't get more expensive, the new running animation can't get more awful. 'please exit arma 3 to manage your mods'. yeah, can't even check out what mods i have loaded - i have to either exit the game or use the clunky mod list at main menu. Recently, the game starts getting random crashes and black screens. But to be fair, it could be caused by mods. Annnd... BI probably found it was a good idea to charge a few extra bucks for some more ugly guns and the bipods which should be implemented years ago. Some mods already had functional bipods/weapon resting way before the official bipod update. Not to mention there are plenty of weapon mods holding a higher quality standard than vanilla and dlc weapons.  So this game only have got worse after all these years? Good job, duh.
9729	1	a	This is a realy nice game ,well made, fun, military Honestly i Think this is the best Military roleplaying game .  -The comunity is full of awensome addons , like climbing addon ,rappel addon ...... and many more  - I do recommend playing with friends for an awensome coop military experience  - Oh yhea and we also have A steam group it Nammed Shadow Company123 (a group that anyone can join and form a team with us , have fun , talk etc ) - The vehicles are are very good and easy to control  - Game Mods: thers a Big variety of mods  - Workshop mission : You can download missions made by comunity and play with friends   Conclusion : this game worths your time .

504	0	a	This game is beyond disappointing. It has so many elements to make it the best... whatever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it wants to be, but it's too buggy and unoptimized. There really is no excuse for Arma 3 to run this bad at this stage of development. Honestly this game is in alpha, whether it says 'full release' or not. There is a huge lack of content compared to the previous Arma. Arma 3 has just about 1/4 of what arma 2 had. The saddest thing overall is the fact that there has been no effort to fix this game in quite sometime. I am fairly certain that Bohemia has the resources, but they refuse to even bother with it.  THEY SERIOUSLY USED RESOURCES TO MAKE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KARTS (a presumably broken waste of money) INSTEAD OF FIXING THEIR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME.
505	0	a	Another day, another ArmA game, another load of bugs and lags. Don't expect this game to run well if you want a solid 60 FPS, it will always find a way to ruin your performance. I'm constanlty monitoring hardware usage and ArmA III lags even while not loading my CPU or GPU above 70% (I'm running the game on a 6 Gb/s SSD). I cannot help but compare this game with Battlefield 4 that runs almost perfectly well. I do realize that BF4 isn't running a whole load of AI and scripts plus its maps and object count are much lower but somehow I feel DICE could do optimization much better than BIS. Seriously, what excuse would you have for a game that lags without hardware bottlenecks (so it seems)? I'm definitely not recommending this game as I'm absolutely convinced that steady performance is above fancy visuals. I've tried all kinds of performance tweaks for this game - launch parameters, custom memory allocators, edits in the .cfg and .ini files, unparking the CPU cores, changing process priority, messing with settings &amp; etc. All they do is give you a tad of extra FPS and nothing more. No tweak will change the fact that ArmA III uses a 32-bit executable and obsolete overcoded engine with no proper multicore support.  On the other note, I don't really like the pseudo-futuristic setting of this game. It's indeed pseudo-futuristic as most all present equipment is denied prototypes or current tech that has nothing futuristic about it except being exotic. Mid-2030s? Even while not being a mil expert I understand that realistic portrayal (isn't this what a tactical shooter is about?) of this age is not possible as we have no idea of technology that's going to be used at the time. Scopes with built-in rangefinders and auto adjustment? That's something already created, greatly promising and not even present in this bogus - same as triton oxygen mask, google glasses, smart bullets, thermal goggles and even real time active spectral matching camouflage (EDIT: The current version now includes Nightstalker Scope that has a built-in rangefinder). A3 setting ended up on the side of cheap pulp fiction. That's not really a major problem since I'm looking forward to mods like ACE 3 and RHS Escalation that should reintroduce the modern stuff by adding new or converting old assets, and it's really good to note that EULA and A3 engine allow this.  The game wields many improvements over ArmA II. The inventory system is marvellous, radio comms sound much more like live chat, visuals, animations and sounds are vastly enhanced but is that really enough when the game often lags like hell because it's purely unoptimised?  A3 is too expensive for its content quality, but I may change my mind if devs manage to improve its performance. However it's unlikely they ever will. The way I see it, in order for ArmA III not to lag BIS will have to code a new but reverse compatible engine on the basis of DirectX 12 with proper multicore support and a 64-bit executable.    http://img.leprosorium.com/2096814  Pathetic performance: core usage, RAM usage, GPU usage and video memory usage. The game barely used 50% of availiable computing power, horrific 22 FPS are of course the result. The only solution is to lower the viewdistance and object distance to the point where whole world turns into a permanent hazy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like your Silent Hill. Needless to say that flying aerial vehicles becomes a questionable undertaking.
506	0	a	WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY 15 DOLLARS FOR 2 CHOPPERS WHEN THE GAME ALREADY COSTS $45?????? SO STUPID
507	0	a	UPDATE 07/06/2014  I was a big fan of OFP. I am playing 'this' game since literally 2002. I was hoping that developers will take it to a completely new level, not only graphics wise, but also improve and sophisticate its Simulation part.  That didn't happen. Instead, what we have now as ArmA III is simply an OFP converted to COD/BF/CS:GO. This game is dead, and not worth spending a dime on it.   PROS + Improved graphics, soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features, leaning, several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands  CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click, horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke, totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck, drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about 'button-press-hold-click' - TONS of bugs without attention.  I do not see a value in this game.  Developers should have been fixing the above issues and improving our gaming experience, instead, those clowns spend time on releasing trash like KARTS in order to suck additional buck from us!   KISS MY A$$ BOHEMIA!
508	0	a	I was a fan of the ArmA series. I really played ArmA II totally grey.. But I had high hopes for ArmA III buying the alpha , promising us more stuff will be added later...  Yes that part is true.. ArmA III on itself is totally empty... You have to get Mods and Payable DLC content to make the game interesting... It is like they gave you the engine of the car only.. You have to pay for the wheels , chassis , doors , windows , lights yourself.  It is suppose to be MilSim , in order to have that label , it should give us also.   What made me being so disappointed about ArmA III... It is that the Helicopter DLC costs 12 euro.. Like WTF
509	0	a	meh.  i have a couple of issues with the game.  1. you need a fantastic cpu and decent gpu to handle this game. otherwise, you will be constantly playing at 20 fps 2. for how much processing they take up, the ai is downright stupid. they are still too slow and hardly use enough cover to blend in with players. -to make up for difficulty, the ai is incredibly accurate and good at detecting. 3. the vanilla campaigns are set so your teams are at poor odds with the ai. this is supposed to be realistic, where real world tactics are used. why is my team running into an enemy town through a valley? 4. the armor system is awful. it takes 5-6 shots to kill with the medium caliber assault rifles. i know they say its because of plate carriers. plates don't necessarily stop bullets, they take a lot of energy out of them so you don't die immediately. getting shot is still going to put you out of a fight. anything past .243 or 6.5 is going to start breaking bones; it would be amazing if you could even still move on your own let alone shoot back accurately. 5. the campaign is mediocre with missions that take too long and put too much responsiblity on the player trying to have fun. arma2 also had bad voice actors with bad lines, but this is a little better. its stilll not much of an improvement.  6.wonky user interface. this have improved on a lot over time, and there are mods to make it more intuitive. it still takes a while to do anything in your inventory though; maybe because in real life, it would take time to rummage through your pockets and ruck sack to find anything. it still sucks though 7. no tutorial. yes i know there is a 'boot camp' thing now. that hardly explains how to use anything. it still missed subjects like actual fighting, flying helicopters and jets, taking cover.  8. mission editor. how do you use it? i don't really know. ive been messing with it for years, i still dont think i know much about how it all works. 9. multiplayer. it doesnt happen. at least from what ive seen. just about all the servers are locked clan servers, or empty public matches. the server browser is cluttered and confusing with no explanation of what it all means. i mean call of duty was so successful partly because of its join a random lobby feature.  i know i mentioned all the bad stuff. there is much good to this game, and im sure other reviewers will point it out. i played this game franchise until i got sick of it. now i play insurgency because its much more fluid and refined with the same idea of critical dammage and little hud.
510	0	a	This isn't really a game, it's more like a dev tool kit for a military shooter. Soldier movement is dated probably the only negative comment related to graphics/physics. There are a couple missions made by arma...and a couple 'showcases' that show you what their vehicles/weapons/drones can do. The training in this game is below average..and the keyboard mapping is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor, overly complicated, and hard to reference. No built in multiplayer like it suggests. Players host their own servers but it's not like BF4, these servers most are locked, others if you d/l this workshop item you can't get in, or if you didn't download another workshop item you can't get in. If you do get in, there's weird rules and no one to tell you what to do.   Conclusion Great platform/developer kit, but i paid good money for a 'game' and as such there's a handful of single player missions, no fmv cut scenes, the 'multiplayer' is not supported through arma only through community, no mission types or user friendly options. soldier animations are oddly dated for an advanced military shooter.
511	0	a	At first this game was a lot of fun to play. But with the time it rather got worse than good.  - The game does not go above 29 FPS for me (on i7 4770k, GTX 770, SSD) - It easily drops under 20 FPS when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - The AI is programmed really bad. Not finding paths. Not moving at all when told to.  The game is just as good without AI as it is with them. Maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. Which again are overly OP compared to your AI... - Since the shutdown of GameSpy it is completely unavailable for Coop missions with friends. Hosting Steam servers was not working since the games release  And last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be 'still under development'  I regret every Cent of the 45 Euros which I payed for this game.
512	0	a	I'd rather stab myself with a rusty pair of pliers repeatedly until death than endure this buggy mess.
513	0	a	The game seems to be ambandoned from the developers... Has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. Also a hell of the lag
514	0	a	ARMA III is one of those games that is really cool in it's own unique way. Unfortunately, ARMA can't stay out of it's own way long enough to remain cool. Before I start, I should mention that this review is based only on my experiences of single player and the editors with the deal-breaking focus on the editors themselves. That said, I'm expecting the dislikes to rain.  This is a difficult one to review. As of writing I've played about 40 hours of almost exclusively single player/editor use. In some ways I really enjoy this game. The biggest draw for me was the editor(s) in this game. The ability to create my own skirmishes anywhere on this giant island and watch them unfold is awesome. You can basically make up any scenario you can imagine and play it out. This alone has kept me entertained for at least 30 hours by itself. I got past the extremely unintuitive user interface and AI quirks and genuinely had a good time hiking around and blowing stuff up.  But, if ARMA is anything, it's a shining example of why documentation is so important in software development. The documentation for ARMA's editors, both 2D and 3D, is bad. And when it's not bad, it's non-existent. What does the Game Logic object actually do in the editor when it seemingly has no inputs or outputs? Why do some modules need to be synced to each other when others don't? How are you supposed to figure out what to sync to what and when?   Usually, there is no answer. Or the answer is outdated or inconsistent between the different editors. Or you'll find other people asking the same questions with the responses basically shrugging. The answers I did find always came down to a 'copy paste this script' or 'follow these exact steps' with no further explanation as to why I was doing these things. That's great for getting something working instantly, not so great for learning how to use the systems and building the intuition needed to take things further.   I don't think this is about the complexity of the editor, I think this is about bad design decisions and lack of consistent, clear documentation. I've worked with Garry's Mod coding for at least a thousand hours and have developed software for many different languages from Python to assembly. The only reason I was able to accomplish these things was from the comprehensive documentation on how things worked and _why_ they worked. And even if they didn't have those things, they at least gave a brief snippit on what is required for the function/module to actually work. Something that the ARMA amazingly doesn't have for the vast majority of it's objects. Just looking at the MP editor modules on ARMA's own wiki page, only about 3% of the listed modules have documentation. The game TIS-100 is more approachable than the depths of these editors.   So, I've had fun with ARMA for the most part. But this well is running dry for me quickly. I wish it wasn't because this feels like the kind of game I would enjoy if ARMA didn't tie its own hands behind its back. For the reasons that I bought this game, I wouldn't recommend it. If you play it for multiplayer, your experience will probably be completely different. So, take this for what it's worth.
515	0	a	unoptimized, has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game modes i can get in garrys mod, all game modes require you to suck the admins male sexual organ just to get in, and good luck if you can find your friends, because this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doesnt even tell you, no, it's not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unrealistic to show you where your friends are, and it doesnt make the game more realistic, it makes it annoying and stupid. Overall, im glad i didnt spend 30 or 60 bucks on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥astraphy because this game sucks major monkey caca, 2/10 id rather play duke nukem forever
516	0	a	I had really high hopes for this game when I was told about it. But I can officially warn you that this game is piece of sh*t. The only functional part of the game is the uninstall option. The physics are none existent and the animations are about as smooth as a man in a wheelchair trying to climb a spiral staircase. Not only that, but the people who play the game are tight f*cks who couldn't make it in the army so they play Arma 3.  There is one positive aspect to this game however, and that is joining high pop servers and team killing all of unbelievably sweaty players who all seem to be consecutively on their periods. It makes DayZ look amazing. D*ckhead simulator 2015
9731	1	a	what? how can I write a review? I don't even have this game... -_-
521	0	a	I keep trying to play this game but I just can't enjoy it because I get 9-20 fps with a i5 cpu and gtx 970 gpu... The game is horrible because of this... When Arma fixes their fps issues then the game will be the best fps and 3rd person shooter ever to exist. I beg them to fix their game... I as well as many others desperately want to play this with a managable framerate.
522	0	a	As a previous ArmA player i couldn't wait to see the new technologies that were going to be used in ArmA 3. Then i played it. From a personal point of view, this game is a complete let down to the ArmA series. Yes it is enjoyable in some aspects, but it is nothing compared to ArmA 2 / OA. If you're looking for a more arcade type military game, you've found it.

524	0	a	I'm gonna get slammed for this review, but you know me:  Arma 3 was recommended to me by a mutual friend at the time, so I looked into it, as well as insisting to pay $60 'the price of a full game' for a shooter that was released over 2 years ago.   I thought I would be amazed with Arma 3... I wasn't.  First strike, I was met with poor optimization and horrendous frame rate issues, even with the terrible looking standard graphics the maximum frames I could only achieve 27. I can already hear everyone shouting 'You're PC is trash! Git gud, Stealth...Poorass.' I will have you know that this is quite the machine I have with an AMD Radeon R7 370 Graphics.  Arma 3's single player offering is a joke. It's worse than Star Wars Battlefront EA singleplayer. After the first mission I just stopped. But then I tried Arma's multiplayer, what the game is praised for. Now I do respect that Arma 3 is supposed to be one of the most realistic military shooters on the market. But perhaps its a bit... too realistic... You're going to spend more time walking with your squad from point A to point B, getting lost and checking your map and compass often alot more than actually fighting in the game.- I've only been in 1 firefight. I would take Battlefield over Arma any day.   I was going to rate Arma 3 a 5. But gets held back to a 4/10 due to it's poor optimization, terrible AI, and dull gameplay.  This was my first refund on Steam and I couldn't be happier to get my full $60 back.  That's gonna do it for Arma 3 and I will see you on the next review. Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548
525	0	a	Great game, But if you plan on playing multiplayer. Expect to get banned by Battleye. Played this franchise since Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis back in 2001 up to the split between Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive. Onto the ARMA franchise. Never cheated and now it's completely unplayable on multiplayer. Battleye has ruined this game for me. They even ban your steam account. Can't just rebuy the game...
526	0	a	I only enjoyed the campaign. It's a great realistic military simulation game but people in the multiplayers are not cooperative. Play it if you want to try campaign and co-op. I Do recommend this game.
527	0	a	I really want to love Arma, but I just cant bring myself to. It's the most realistic game ever, and it has probably a lifetimes worth of content. Beautiful graphics and the complexity of the gameplay isn't actually all that daunting once you get used to it. But thats not the problem. The problem is the dog-dirt AI. Its seriously the worst AI I have ever seen in a video game, EVER. I actually cannot describe how awful it is.   Should you attempt to use AI to help you drive a vehicle, God have mercy on your soul. Try and be the gunner? The driver is going to do his best to run into walls and flip the tank in a ditch. See an enemy? Well then he is going to turn the tank around, expose the weak rear armor, and stop in an open field. Tell him to move? Nope, suddenly they forgot how to obey commands and do a weird back and forth jerking roll thing. Try and be the driver? The gunner in a tank with thermal optics will somehow miss a tank sitting 3 feet in front of him. Your infantry teammates will engage the enemy by breaking cover, running into the middle of the street, and spraying on full auto. Vehicles constantly get stuck on rocks, lampposts, trees, ditches, ect. Sometimes they won't spot an enemy in the open while they are being used as target practice, and other times they pull of aimbot level first-shot headshots from 500m while standing upright. Helicopters and planes are more effective as kamikaze weapons, and single enemies with rifles can easily take out a wing of attack helos.   I really really want to love this game, but its virtually impossible to enjoy with AI teammates. I have every AI enhancement mod I can find, nothing helps. Every time I come back to it I get so mad. Whether its my M1 driver stopping in an open field and then un-learning how to drive so we can be RPG fodder or my gunner in an apache refusing to engage enemy infantry in the open leading to an early demise, the AI in this game is insanely poor. It makes the AI out of battlefield 2 look like rocket science. AI able to take the initiative and get in a technicals .50 without being specifically ordered to approach the vehicle, and then you having to get in and switch spots for 10 minutes to finagle them out of a passenger seat into the obviously useful position is a pipe dream in this game. Its super enjoyable to walk around and play in Zeus mode, but unless you have great internet you are going to get very, very, very upset.

529	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ developers who add DLC into the game which you cant use untill you buy them. Such a foul move to get players to have to buy their dlcs..   Back in my days, dlc were for free. :(
530	0	a	65/100  Pro's Very good scale, and detail in the world allows you to see things miles away.  A large selection of well modeled weapons, gear, vehicles.  Multiplayer if done right, can be epic and quite a bit of fun. These servers are extremely hard to find though.  Cons Very poor AI - I'm talking drop dead liberal half baked hippie 2nd grade education type of stupid.  NO CONTENT - took almost 2 months just to release a few single player missions No Multiplayer Support - no real official missions or servers to help keep the population high.  BUGS BUGS BUGS Performance issues Missing a lot of must have vehicles and aircraft that would really add to the simulation.  I would NOT recommend buying this game until about a year of patches and they complete the game. It is UNFINISHED as of right now.
531	0	a	This game crashes constantly. I have yet to play a full multiplayer match because it freezes within 10 minutes of playing every time. I have a high spec computer and play other games on highest settings. When I try to play Arma 3 on lowest settings, it crashes. This game is what we call a complete failure. Save your money for a game that actually works.
532	0	a	Some background: I first started playing Bohemia Interactive games in 2001, when I played the demo for Operation Flashpoint from a Computer Gaming World disk. I owned all of the Operation Flashpoint expansions, as well as ARMA II, and now ARMA III.  This game sucks sh*t. All of them have, and all of them have depended on the addons to make the game playable. BI Has never made a decent game, only a platform with promise that modders/mission makers polish up.  -I don't know why BI continues to make storylines, they've always been awful at them. -AI sucks. I just fired up a mission and was told to plant explosives on some mobile artillery. The Platoon Leader said 'and everyone else take cover'.. apparently a couple AI thought it best to run towards the mobile artillery, so I accidently killed them ---leading to a mission failure, and them shooting at me.  -Before that two soldiers got killed running off on their own (funny, never saw that in the Ranger Handbook) -Most multiplayer servers with a decent ping are either RPG or DM... I should not have to explain why this is stupid.  +Voice acting gets slightly less terrible each game. +Graphics are decent  I don't recommend getting this unless it's like 75% off and you understand what you're getting.

534	0	a	This is not a good game.   The engine is a mess. I don't think any computer on earth can run this game at 60FPS with a lot of scripts in the background or if there is a lot going on. Everybody knows this, yet it seems to be shrugged off by the community or even laughed at. The game plays awfully as well, it's very clunky and unresponsive. You have to play to understand, of course. It all has to do with a broken and unoptimized engine. I question how they got away with it.  The multiplayer is awful as nobody plays it for the Arma experience. This game blew up, and 'life'servers dominate the multiplayer. You'll either be playing king of the hill, 'life'roleplays, or zombie servers. You also can't forget the awful performance you'll get in multiplayer, as there are usually scripts in the background. Enjoy playing at low FPS.   If you want a military simulator, look elsewhere.
535	0	a	Trailer explain this is game actually is still under devellopment. They are basically looking for players to play this game to actually test the game and server stability and more. Buy game? Not yet.
536	0	a	waste of 40$ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you.spend more time trying to play then actually playing
9733	1	a	this game is so hard, i can't even get in the car
541	0	a	WHERE ARE THE JETS. I BOUGHT THIS SOLEY FOR THE JETS
542	0	a	First off i have to say i HATE Multiplayer games. they are not fun for me in the slightest. just a bunch of idiots modding to win. so i never tried the multiplayer.  I got this for the Singleplayer, and i have to say it sucks. its far too scripted. i cant do any thing my way i have to stand here.. stand there... listen to some idoit talk and curse for half a hour when he could just say it over the radio whilst i walk or drive so i am not so bored with the crappy dialogue, but no... It's BORRING.  Even when i actually got to shoot half a hour later... the gun physics are so lame i laughed and shortley after quit and uninstalled it. If you shoot a rifle at 50 metres square at a target the size of a torso, the bullet will hit it, but in this so called SIM it won't most of the time. Guns just are not that unaccrate. shotguns have spread not rifles. a rifle at 50 metres will be 1 cm each way tops not 50 cm. that alone is enough for me to quit and uninstall it and NEVER play it again.
543	0	a	The engine looks nice, but based on the older operation flashpoint engine still. Entering houses feels 'iffy' and like walking around on honey - god forbid going prone in one... it's like the house knows judo.
544	0	a	This isn't a bad game, but it's not worth the price, and it's mostly a template for mods, and set in the future. If you want a true military experience, i would strongly reccomend arma 2 co, its worth the price, not this template.
545	0	a	Worst FPS ever if you have AMD. 15-22fps in most of the online modes. (AMD FX 6300, 8GB RAM, Radeon R9 270, etc.)
546	0	a	This game is probably the least fun game I've played in a long time. It tries to sell itself as a military sim, but it's as much a military sim as minecraft. Wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. Also, 60 dollar price tag? Games like Red Orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. You're money is better spent elsewhere.
547	0	a	Could be good but riddled with bugs and people that are elitist â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I spent hours watching videos and reading web pages and as soon as I came across a problem that I could not find a solution for online, all you get in any chat channel is a bunch of jerks that accuse you of not looking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. WHAT A MASSIVE WASTE OF MY MONEY!! The technology is there, the game is ok looking but all the time textures pop in and out and there is a lot of glitches and problems. I run this on a great machine that has never had a problem running anything but this game even after 3 years has a ton of visual issues. PASS!
548	0	a	Worst game ever i seen. You are just running. The game is about running. Don't buy !
549	0	a	Worst controls in a game ever... Really want to like this game, but it's hard to enjoy without spending hours learning their painfully unintuitive controls
550	0	a	This game looked promising in alpha but has been patched to a worse and worse state ever since. Don't let any of the pretty screenshots or clips fool you. It's practically still an alpha game and will probably never leave this state. If you're the type of person who finds fun in playing scenarios against extremely stupid bots, this might serve. For anyone else, don't waste your money. The netcode is absolutely horrible - the game is full of lagging, rubberbanding and anything else you might expect from a game that hasn't been finished at all. No matter how fast of a hellmachine you have below your desk, the game will almost always run at max. ~35fps in multiplayer, a lot less if in action. So aiming and hitting someone is rather a game of luck than anything else. Further, the gun and aiming mechanics are absolutely cumbersome and just annoy the crap out of you in combination with the weak engine. Right now you just aim at someone, fire, and very often absolutely nothing happens. No hit, no blood, nothing, even after firing a whole magazine at the enemy while keeping the crosshairs exactly at him, from a distance of, say, 50-100m. Does actually happen. In multiplayer the enemy you try to eliminate then starts running around like a rabbit (because they know exactly how it looks on your screen - it makes it even harder to hit him, because he starts teleporting from one point to another), and tries to spot you while doing so. Yes, that's right. In a 'military simulation' it has proven to be more effective to run around like a crazy ape, right in the open field, than to look for cover and continue from there. The structures look mostly the same and are full of bugs aswell. You can't go through a door without getting stuck in some way, in like 50% of cases you get stuck right at the bottom of stairs and have to take a step back and try again (no need to mention how much it's going to trigger you if you get killed because of this stupid sh..). So stairs and doors are to be considered extremely risky to use - just like in real life right? Right, it's a simulation, it has to be realistic!  In spite of everything the developer of this game absolutely avoids improving the engine or the netcode since release in any way, they rather design some new weapons they can wrap into a dlc and sell for 10 bucks. Since alpha the game has used cpu power in an absolutely unoptimized manner, has therefore extremely poor performance on even newer machines and just makes it impossible to have a nearly fluid aiming experience. There is always some lag or stutter that often will decide about the outcome of a confrontation.  Like I said in the beginning, there was a lot of hope and potential for this game when alpha released, but this is now more than 3 years ago and not many of the relevant aspects and weaknesses of this game were actually improved. It might actually have gotten worse since then. I bought it for like 20â‚¬ back then and even for this price I would definitely not buy it again. Do not buy this crippled piece of software.
551	0	a	Terrible 2/10 such lag the lack of everything in this game gives it the 2/10 save you're 60$
552	0	a	If you came here because saw some youtube of great playz and got hyped on this game go and watch some longplay footage without editing or watch live-stream. Then you may change your mind. Because regular gameplay is way different from carefully edited best-ofs. This game has these nice moments separated by long periods of struggling with interface and trying not to die from glitches.  Is is not kind of game you can grab on sale and have fun with. You can't start playing this game without having someone to introduce you to it because singleplayer is really limited and multiplayer is quite inaccessible to uninitiated newbie. So if you wonder if you could just take it and play for some hours having fun then forget about it - you wont. And if some of your friends told you to play with them then sure, by all means take it - even fighting with sticks with friends is fun so Arma3 can be too ;).  You can read negative reviews about game optimization. These are reviews from somebody who probably never played actual Arma3 - game runs great, looks great, works smooth with hi-rez and hi-fps. But then who buys Arma to play Arma? Not many. Obviously. People install Arma to play mods. But mods, that are lifeblood of gaming and salvation of the industry [sarcasm!], are usually made by wannabe-pros-script-kids who plant hack over hack in mod in attempt to implement anything. Constant loops designed to eat cpu cycles, photo-quality textures for sexy female models, shiny new guns with more polygons than whole aircraft. Then couple of these are bunched together on one server, with possible conflicts and no concern about limitations of average user's hardware. People cry that their powerful pcs can't handle it but it is terrible quality mods that kill it and slow your game to crawl. Game is optimized but mods are not curated so every piece of random hacks are allowed and people who run mods expect the game engine to somehow detect bad code and optimize it. Want high fps? Dont install poor mods. Refuse to play unoptimized mods and encourage others to stop playing them - maybe this way you will tell mod-devs to start thinking about their work [hint: they will just stop making mods].  The problem is that beside vehicle and bullet mechanics things go wrong in this production. Physics is bad - you will make backflips with your APC or die from touching dynamic object. Infantry controls are terrible - probably infantry unit is not required in simulator for army so what you receive here is human character that is controled like a tank. Nobody cared to plan and hone useful user interface to provide smooth control system for player character. You get avatar to control and whole keyboard of buttons to make him move. You can customize it to your will, you can use all external devices you like - but it is up to you to make it work. And even when you make it work as you want you will still have game with unfinished mechanic for infantry:  - your gear doesn't limit your movement so you can carry kgs of equimpent and you will crawl, crouch and stand up at the same speed.  - you cannot even cancel action - you started doing something you are sitting duck.  - missing animations and movement options you would expect from combat-sim. If you can think about doing something you can't do it. Numerous games accustomed us to make quick combat movements, sliding under/over obstacles, hiding behind cover or jumping over walls, entering through the windows and so on so it is painful to be unable to do it here. You cannot even pull out weapon while walking or switch to binoculars while lying down.  - carrying heavier weapon in your hands feels like holding a handgun - you can run around with it feeling no inertia or being slowed down. Some arcade games feel more realistic than Arma.  Game wasn't built around infantry, it is not FPS by heart, this is vehicular combat sim with driver/pilot and gun operator. Infantry units are implemented as VR training for rookies - learning the bullet behavior for long distance shooting, practicing mildot ranging, operating launchers, working with map and team communication.  You won't have smooth close-mid range combat with guns.  This part of the engine was hacked into the existing system and barely works.  Unfortunately.
553	0	a	11/10
554	0	a	DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAY ON YOUR OWN!!!  This is a fantstic game. Lots of things to try but it must be done with friends who can revive you. Otherwise you will fall victim to little boys with snipers overlooking helicopter shops, gun shops etc taking either you out or the helicoper engine immediately as it spawns.  To summarise: Game = Great. Player Base = People who were bullied at school and / or got socks for christmas
9735	1	a	Although many fans of the ARMA series have been critical of certain aspects of this game(such as the choice to make it based in the future) I would still highly recommend this game to any fan of FPS, RPG, or Strategy game types. The base game is basically FPS, but the modding community has expanded it's basic description to meet other gamers needs(Including my own). This game has a strong/loyal fan base, and has for years. If you don't try this game at some point you honestly haven't lived!

I did not drop 60 dollars for this crap.  Nothing like being in multiplayer and finding a weapons and getting 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you buy apex'.
559	0	a	Rubbish game With great good graphics and an exciable ending to the story where meaty m8 blaze tryes to take over europe to save his family and enilate all minoritys. all in all i rate this 8/8 m8
560	0	a	They like to choke people down with there dlc and It's just become to much.
561	0	a	Game is pretty cool and detailed ... but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road Im a cheapskate ... paying for extra model just make me sick ....  if they would come out with actual add-on Ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue  with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng + some mission i m on thats fine by me i'd buy  But here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more DLC's .... Just my opinion
562	0	a	Dear Arma,   It's not you... It's me.  A popular positive review by [Fog]Snow elequiently said, 'Kids play Call Of Duty, Boys play Battlefield, Men play Arma.'   I am a man all day, doing manly things at my manly job, and when I come home I just want to be a boy.   I have no problem getting killed with a single bullet, dealing with bullet drop, limited amo, or stamina effects on aiming. I love all of those things, and those are the reasons I started this relationship. But you're high maintinance, I can't give you the time you require, and I don't have a big enough friend group for you to like me.  Yesterday:  4hrs - Play singleplayer to learn controls, loving the game so far.  0.5hrs - Jump into 'Quick Play' try to go into normal FPS game modes like catpure the flag. All but two game modes either told me it couldn't find a server, or that I didn't have the DLC. Seems odd to me.  0.5hrs - Playing 'Caputre the Island' spawned in the middle of the ocean. WTF!!? Some guy on mic says you need to install something which will make a carrier ship appear, so if you don't have that you just fall into the ocean and can't get to the helicopters. Hmm okay.  1hrs - Same game, spawning at the points that are on land. Me and about 15 people are all waiting on a heli to pick us up. Sigh... Bored... Oh look a heli, yay!  0.05hrs - Heli gets shot down in route to town, I bail the heli like a Jason Bourne bad @ss and go to deploy my parachute to fly in like a tiger ninja raining down bullet hell that could make a grown man cry... but I don't have a parachute. Splat!   0.5hrs - Profanity, inanimate objects accelerating accross the room at forces greater than or equal to gravity, anger at game, dissapointment in purchase, hope of reimbursement, worry about game time spent in single player, sadness at time lost, look at clock and it is past bed time, tired, work tomorrow.  I am a software engineer by day and spend a lot of time figuring out computer related things. Like a TV show watcher, I too like to unwind at the end of the day, but for me I get that in gaming.   No I'm not 60, I am in my 20's.  WORKING FOR FUN IS NOT FUN WHEN YOU JUST GOT DONE WORKING FOR 8 HOURS.  In conclusion, Arma I'm sure there is someone perfect out there for you...but it's not me. I really wanted us to work out, I truly did, but it wasn't meant to be. I hope we can still be friends....  ps. yes I tried other game modes as you can see from my play time, but I didn't have much success. One game I got in and 2 mins later got kicked, I wasn't using a mic, I was playing the objective so not sure what I did.  yes I know this is a strategic sim, not a fly out of a heli 007 game, I was really mad that I had to A) spawn and wait close to an hour for another heli, or B) quit, download software for the carrier and join back in  In that timespan I could have played 2 BF4 games and had loads of fun. I wish Battlefied was more tacticle, but I'll take it over Arma because I have more fun overall.
563	0	a	Broken from the start. Horrible gunplay, often crashes, laggy â™¥â™¥â™¥ multiplayer. The action menu alone is reason enough to not reccomend this game
564	0	a	quite meh to be brutally honest
565	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. They flood the loot tables with DLC weapons, attachments, ammo varients and clothing and expect you to purchase the DLC on the spot. Hell no. Not recommended unless you love having watermarks on your screen and a constant prompt to waste your money on DLC, that, in total, adds up to the same cost of a triple A title.
9739	1	a	It's trash but it's really good.
9741	1	a	It has very poor optimization and since the release of Apex a big chunk of the community has been placed behind a paywall. Despite this the campaign is very enjoyable and does a great job immersing you in the game. The multiplayer can be fun depending on the servers you join and having the Steam workshop available allows you to join any server with mods easily as long it is on the workshop.
577	0	a	The Game was absolutely beautiful to look at, Graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time Arma player the user friendly version is not there. Leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. Camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pad's 0 key a lot. Once outside the vehicle your camera's axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. It does however have the genuine military simulation feel. For the amount of times it use the F-Bomb you'd think you were on a military boat. Hence the term make a sailor blush. All in all I'd give it a 6 out 10.
578	0	a	Can't, just Can't  What can i say. Is it realistic?-yes! But with the laggy connections, question graphics, and did i mention the laggy connection??? gun fights at close range arent about anything other than whos got the better connection to the server.  Ive shot a guy 3 times at close range with a sniper rifle (point blank in chest). He killed me, I asked him how he was still standing, his responce? You shot me? ......   This is what you deal with, you can shoot people but do to horrible server connections the game simply becomes who can get a bigger gun.... Not what i paid for.
9743	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shit i just paid 60$ for this game and now its on sale. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. steam plz refund  
582	0	a	Pros -lots of fun  -two well made maps  -good mod suport -good online play   Cons  - in the two big maps and the manny verations of it i serched and serched and could not find a TURBO MAN doll   final  although it was fun there was no turbo man dolls and for that im out
583	0	a	game is dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ needs optimization. 2/10
584	0	a	It sucks it has the worst campain, it crashes all the time, the phyics suck, it has the worst A.I., and also if your playing on sever that does saves your progress then when you crash which happens all the damn time you have to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing start over
585	0	a	Too advanced, and teamates will ditch you constantly. Also many framerate issues.
586	0	a	very bad optimization. i cant even play
587	0	a	horrible, trying to get a refund... waste of money
588	0	a	do u want to get blown up by screaming arabics? no? DONT DOWNLOAD. do u want to get run over by some â™¥â™¥â™¥ wipe? no DONT DOWNLOAD. ARMA 3 is not a fun game. DONT DOWNLOAD
589	0	a	Waste of money. Nobody in their right mind should purchase this game. When looking at the recommended settings to run the game, disregard them. It is all lies and cannot run. Poor game choice for those who may find it fun. Rating: .5-10
590	0	a	I love arma 2 but arma 3 is one of the worst games i have ever played. one of the reason i like arma 2 is the warfare game mode but there isint a good warfare mode in arma 3.
9745	1	a	Awsome Game! Worth buying! :D
591	0	a	Just get Arma 2 Combined Operations.
592	0	a	This game has more bugs than a bug nest.
593	0	a	not recommended just buy a BF3 or BF4 you will enjoy for long long looong time.
9747	1	a	,
598	0	a	After putting around 60 hours into this game i can not recommend it in its current form. The multiplayer performace is horrible at best. (~17fps at 8320 and a gtx970). The game still crashes randomly which resultet in complete profile losses. (So if you game crashes and you play a multiplayer mod with progression like altis or koth everything will be gone)   Overall i would say do not buy into this game unless you are willing to deal with an incredile amoutn of bugs/glitches and a performance which is on the same level as the slaughtering grounds.   DO NOT BUY IT
599	0	a	ever since i played operation flashpoint, and fell in love with the RTS , you could build a base and then send tanks to kill your opponents base or fly a jet or helicopter to do it personally, the weapons were realistic damage wise which I never see, the idea was amazing but it was buggy I couldnt wait for the sequel that would straighten them out, op flash 2 was a dud. then I heard of the first arma, and again my hopes were lifted. But again I was disappointed. then I bought arma 2 and again was disapointed mainly by empty servers for both 1 and 2. now I see good reviews on Arma 3, and I cant imagine who is giving them since arma 1 and 2 had hardly a soul actually playing, I refuse to be disappointed again.  Also the AA was so overpowered that there was no way you could destroy a base with a jet or helicopter, youd be instantly shot down, super bummer.
9749	1	a	like am relly a sowjer, gunz an tankz anss then big asplowshunz
601	0	a	It's not very friendly to beginners. The steep learning curve takes away a lot of the fun. Especially because it's a multi player focused game and there are very few game types active at any given time, and the ones that are active require paid DLC. So, I paid 40 bucks and it's not very fun to play, if you can even get into a game.
9751	1	a	like am relly a sowjer, gunz an tankz anss then big asplowshunz
613	0	a	trash game u need to shoot some one about 4-6 times with 7.62 in the head to kill someone trash dont buy
614	0	a	constantly crashes and lags but that may be the type of laptop I have got I do not reccomend this game!
615	0	a	The game is poorly optimized. I get around 45 fps on my potato pc in campaign but only 5 fps online for some reason. Moreover, you can barely play this game online without buying all the DLCs. Not only do you have to buy a 55 dollar game but have to buy all the DLCs totalling to 77 bucks. That's 130 bucks for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game where you get destroyed by 9 year olds who've all had sex with your mum. The community is fine actually but some servers are cancerous and I forgot to mention that the game is a bit buggy as well. I'm not made of money nor my parents are rich af so I didn't get all the DLCs and got this game on sale. Even with sale, everything would've cost me about 90 bucks which is just way too expensive for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. This maybe a great game with strategic gameplay but not worth everything you're throwing into it. Also, when I see games like these who divide all their necessary game componets into DLCs and charge you 45 bucks for one of them, I feel ashamed to be a gamer. Arma 3 is no different than those pay to win games you get on your phone and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
616	0	a	I tried playing it sometime ago, not long though. Couldn't get a proper grasp on keyboard controls and found it to be difficult soley on that. Haven't put much effort into it since.
617	0	a	When it can hold 60 fps like dayz can now ill make a positive review.  PC - intel i7 16 gb ram and a gtx 980 20-40 fps in not acceptable...
618	0	a	Lost of bugs. Crashes a lot and if you cant get it going soon (its a bit complicated and will take you a minute to figure it out) you end up playing 'past your refund time played'. I spent hours trying to research maps i can actually play. Thanks steam.
619	0	a	Its a simulator alright..... just not a war simulator. Its more of a walking around/ driving around simulator with occasional shooting. I am going to attack this game.... it won't be pretty.... so if you are faint of heart or have fan boyingitis you might want to not read. Ugh.... but where the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do I start? From the moment you start playing this game it will hit you with 1000s of extremely bizarre design decisions that defy all logic and reason. Like for instance, there is THREE buttons for standing, crouching, and going prone( I may be thinking of dayz, so forgive me if I am wrong because they both just kinda melded into a big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pile in my mind). I mean most games manage to only have one button for this WHY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WAS THAT SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT THAT THEY ENDED UP WITH THREE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BUTTONS?!?!?! Just the excessive amount of buttons on your keyboard this game uses is unbearable and requires frequent control checks to even do basic things like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CROUCHING. Then the game has a third person 'option', but anyone who is anyone knows that if there is an option for third person in a fps that you use it. It lets you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing see around corners, so congratz on giving us that option..... Then there for some reason is TWO versions of zooming in, one makes your person scope in PURELY WITH HIS OWN EYES LIKE HE IS SOME KIND OF SUPER HERO and the other uses your weapons scope. Then we got the insane fall damage. Do you remember playing on the jungle gym at school and jumping off that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like a boss without even a scratch? Well in arma if you jump from that height as a grown â™¥â™¥â™¥ army man you die. Yeah idk wtf............Its shameful..... truelly and I am only scratching the surface, trust me its alot worse then I can put into print.  Alright so lets talk about game modes, Its probably got more then I can imagine, but lets talk about the three I experienced. First team death match, sounds good right? WRONG! Actually it may have been king of the hill, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if I care it still sucked. Well your objective was to go into an area and control it which is perfectly fine, untill you take into acount that you spawn LITERALLY 2 MILES away from the area EVERY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TIME YOU DIE. This isn't like the bf version of spawning far away, in there you always have a way to get to the battle faster like spawning on your team, here you always spawn in the same stupid field with a couple transports. *Sigh* Ok so you get in the vehicle and start on your way to the hill....... thing... where the team death match happens and everything is going ok(slow and boring, but ok). THEN SUDDENLY AN ATOMIC â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BOMB SHOOTS OUT FROM HELL WHEN YOUR ALMOST THERE AND INCINERATES YOUR WHOLE CREW! Then you respawn back in the field(more like purgatory) and wait for the transport to respawn, so you can begin the EPIC ride back to the...place?   WAIT A MINUTES IS THAT A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CHOPPER? OMG IT IS! You quickly run over to it and get in! AW YEAH THIS GAME IS GOING TO FINALLY GET FUN! NOPE! You couldn't have known, but the chopper controls in this game UIBUASDHGIUADBGD!!!!!111! Sorry, they are bad.....they touched me in my no no place and they were coded into the game by cthulu him self for ONLY HE FROM THE DEPTHS could possibly comprehend this madness! Even 'good pilots'(their words not mine) only manage to make it 10 ft before critcal engine failure occurs. Then the real PRO MLG ARMA pilots that actually can fly them by some miracle don't even try to land the damn things. They tell you to just jump out and parachute because they know damn well it will explode if they even barely tap the ground. The first time I ever even got to the holy hill was from parachuting and it worked suprisingly well, so I guess they managed to do something good. I died almost immediately from someone camping in a window, but I at least gazed for a brief moment on the promised land.  Then we got this strange free roam game type with factions. I don't have any clue what it was called because I imagine my brain deeply repressed it into my subconcious to be forgotten. It was the best by far of the arma game types I played, which puts it at about free flash game levels of quality, but at least it was tolerable. Kinda, I guess..... Well anyways you spawn on an island and you fight with your other faction members for control of the map. Its got stores and stuff to buy vehicles and guns, but mostly you will be getting SNOIPED by people hiding in houses like rabid neck beards. I can't imagine these people having any fun sitting In houses, hills, or trees all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing day for that ONE KILL, but for some reason in every game that uses this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ arma engine(such as dayz) these people are all over the place. WTF is it about these games that draw in these campers? Is it because they get kicked out of or mocked for being noobs in every other decent fps? Yeah, probably.... Lets go with that.  Then the final game type I played, if you can even call it that. RP or atlas life or something, who cares. Yeah I tried out a roleplay server because I figured it would be maybe like gmod dark rp, where fun is always the most important part. ROFL you bet it wasn't fun! You start out as just a civilian, but you can mine and make money! It is literally even more boring and more work then real mining, so I promptly gave up on rp. At that point I would just get a real job mining because at least then I would make real money for my hard work. Yeah I wouldn't suggest you ever play this game, even if your real life is more boring then working. I would personally reccommend you stare at a concrete wall and try to see shapes before I would tell anyone to play this game.
620	0	a	Terrible game Purchased the game on my new comp loggen in said i was Global Ban or something tried contacting steam and bhio'ARMA 3'
621	0	a	I have only played this on the Sp campaign so far so my thoughta are based on this as a solo experience. This is a flipping JANKY (holy mother it is sooo janky) game, first of all. i have seen more bugs than a red roof inn, it seriously kindof playes like an early access release. The AI is soooo bad. which wouldnt be that big of a deal except you have to constantly micro manage a group of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ through an active war zone of aim botted one shot kills. This is made somewhat better through mods but not really. i can say for certain that the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN is NOT a military sim in any sense. It is a bad COD level story supplemented by an amazingly obtuse control scheme, that makes this feel more like a typing simulater than any kind of military game.(Honestly i know people are going to crucify me for this, but MGSV, in all its rediculous story glory, is about 1000x a more competant 'sim' than this) It is probably better in Multiplayer when you dont have to deal with the shokingly bad AI, but it basically puts you through a bunch of bad story beats on par with the worst military action game, but with flight sim controls. I am very VERY suprised at my reaction to this game so far. im hoping the excellent MOD community and hopefully good multiplayer community will change my opinion moving foreword. i want a good milsim that encourages smart tactics and careful, controlled action. I hope i find that game in here soon.
9753	1	a	7/10  Single player is fine. Mods can make SP a fun experience. But once you try MP, that's a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. The FPS on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. It is higly unlikely you will get above 30 FPS on a public server. I can't speak for private servers but if you want to play MP, play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server.  Only recommended because of SP
622	0	a	Poor Optimization...for the graphics card...  I have a i7-6700k, with a closed loop liquid cooler, HyperX 8GB Ram, and an AMD R9 380. Yet I can't play this game with decent fps on medium settings...going lower makes it about 15fps...which is still unplayable.  Please Bohemia Interactive you need to optimize this game somehow... :'(
623	0	a	Not good, don't waste $40 on this game, I can't get my money back because I afk'd for 2 hours because I didnt close the game. I regret this purchase.
9755	1	a	If you plan on buying this game. Make sure you have a GPU better then an AMD Radeon 7750 1GBDDR5. Because thats what I have and I CANNOT go higher then standard settings. And on standard I'm getting 27-30 FPS. Kind of sad that this game alone cost gamers $8 Million in computer upgrades. THIS GAME ALONE.

629	0	a	if you like a game full of bugs and major server lag then this game is for you! no matter how good your pc is do not expect anything above 30fps. This is another very poorly optimized pc game. Also its another one of those games that you HAVE to buy DLCs or you will not find anyone to play with.

631	0	a	arma is good ill give it that, but thats all ill give. The game is good, runs smoothly, and for the most aprt without any hiccups. There is only one thing i see wrong, Price of dlc i mean seriously 30 something dollars for a couple of helis the community can make in five minutes? they do really need to rethink this whole marketing thing, not all gamers are rich people

9759	1	a	If your looking for an review you wont find it here. BUT! I have a recipe for perfect Egg Salad.    INGREDIENTS 6 HARD-BOILED EGGS, sliced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Lettuce leaves    INGREDIENTS 6 HARD-BOILED EGGS, sliced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Lettuce leaves Yields: 4 servings NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTIONS  RESERVE and refrigerate 4 center egg slices for garnish, if desired. CHOP remaining eggs.  MIX mayonnaise, lemon juice, onion, salt and pepper in medium bowl. ADD chopped eggs and celery; mix well. REFRIGERATE, covered, to blend flavors.  SERVE on lettuce leaves, garnished with reserved egg slices.  Easy 12-Minute Method for Hard-Boiled Eggs: Place eggs in a saucepan large enough to hold them in a single layer. Add cold water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Heat over high heat just to boiling. Remove from the burner. Cover pan. Let eggs stand in hot water for about 12 minutes for large eggs (9 minutes for medium eggs; 15 minutes for extra large eggs). Drain. Shock the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool them immediately. Hard-boiled eggs are easiest to peel right after cooling.    Tips   This creamy egg salad can be layered with crunchy lettuce on whole wheat toast for a simple sandwich, or stuffed into cherry tomatoes for an impressive appetizer.  Very fresh eggs can be difficult to peel. To ensure easily peeled eggs, buy and refrigerate them a week to 10 days in advance of cooking. This brief â€œbreatherâ€ allows the eggs time to take in air, which helps separate the membranes from the shell.  Hard-boiled eggs are easiest to peel right after cooling. Cooling causes the egg to contract slightly in the shell.  To peel a hard-boiled egg: Gently tap egg on countertop until shell is finely crackled all over. Roll egg between hands to loosen shell. Starting peeling at large end, holding egg under cold running water to help ease the shell off.  Hard-boiled egg storage time: In the shell, hard-boiled eggs can be refrigerated safely up to one week. Refrigerate in their original carton to prevent odor absorption. Once peeled, eggs should be eaten that day.  ENJOY!
9761	1	a	Better than No Man's Sky
634	0	a	This game is a really clunky, boring, running simulator with a lot of pretentious, self-important kids who wish they could've joined the army but had to settle for ordering people around in a video game for no reason. The controls are awful, the graphics are mediocre, and the gameplay is boring because there isn't any. It's mostly just a running sim.

637	0	a	waste of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money
9765	1	a	The Single Player is alright, but multiplayer is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game.   Life Mods/Battle Royale/Wasteland/King of the Hill are all incredibly fun.    Main issues: VERY high system requirements, low frames in altis multiplayer on even the best PCs  6/10 Single Player 9/10 Multiplayer
638	0	a	This game is one of the greatest multiplayer experience i ever had in a video game. Except one thing:  Performance of the game in multiplayer. It is terrible, no matter what your specs are, prepare to face 25-40 fps all the time in multiplayer. I'm glad that developer supporting this game through patches, dlc etc. But i simply cannot enjoy a game when framerate is all over the place. Low framerate=biger input lag, in a game when every second matters, it is unnaceptable.   Besides bad performance, it's a great milsim, with focus on teamwork, tactics etc.
639	0	a	A great game from the start, and later dying. The community is filled with quiet people with little to no communication.
640	0	a	So the majority of players populate RPG servers like Atlis Life instead of servers that host military maps such as CTi Warfare. That is proof enough that the game is a massive failure for what it is intended.   IMO the failure is down to lack of content first and foremost. Lack of guns, lack of everything , not even a BRDM ATGM or 'futuristic' equivilent that I feel is essential for any battlefield.... just one example, nevermind the rest of the stuff that is missing.   Oh, and charging relativelty big money for two helicopters and a flight model that nobody even asked for... Ridiculous. Operation Arrowhead/Resistance etc... cost just a little more and had massive content.   People bleat on (especially the stepford wives on the BIS forums) about 'supporting the devs' and buy the overpriced DLC. I bought the game therefore I am supporting the devs. If you want more money from me then release an OA style addon and not low content DLC BS.   What in gods name have the devs been doing all this time if these simple DLC packs are all they have to release? Every game since CWC has a major addon released within a year give or take a few months..... except Arma 3  And the weapon sway... By all means make the shooting mechanics unique and difficult to master (I dont want a COD clone here) But when I play, I like to play CTI maps. That includes killing vast amounts of infantry. Before it was no problem. Now I have to play a stupid minigame everytime I want to line up my sights with a target meaning the game is impossibly long and infuriating. There is not even a server setting to customise the game for a particular game mode. WTF is that about? If you just put that in then that would make it a whole lot less tiresome for a lot of people.   I had high hopes for the game when I bought it but I just cannot recommend it. Buy Arma 2 and all the addons for very cheap and just play that. Arma 2 is a vastly superior game and that makes me very sad indeed.

9767	1	a	It's a simulator on modern combat. You hardcore or not?
644	0	a	worst arma game in history. it feels more like COD or Battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didn't do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like VTOL planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another LMG. finally the NATO forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the OPFOR and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes, helis and IFVs is terrible there should be more IFVs than tanks and thats not the case, if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 MBTs and a IFV im more likely to take a MBT and 2 IFVs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.
645	0	a	Don't buy BI games. You will regret it.
9769	1	a	Arma 3 is the definite game in the military simulation series from Bohemia Interactive. From massive and highly-detailed environments to expansive collections of weapons and vehicles, Arma 3 is a modern military sandbox for both players and modders. Arma 3's most exciting aspects are the built-in editor, Steam Workshop support, and near endless possibilities of community-created scenarios. Arma 3 refines and masters the military simulation genre.
9771	1	a	The best sandboxes out there
9773	1	a	arma isn't like cod,bf its more like gta but more realistic, i mean you don't rly steel ppls cars you need a key/lockpick to the car and its not that easy to get money either. To get money u have to like pick apples or sell weed. It was boring when i started to play this game but it did become funnier and funnier every time. To play this game u need a lot of time i say.
9775	1	a	Great successor for the ArmA series.  The game itself plus its modded game modes will never get old.
9777	1	a	Pretty good. Graphics do cause a few glitches. Sadly I keep dying in the campaign as Kerry. But besides that, its not bad. 10/10 would bang.
9779	1	a	'I'm not going to pay this money for this game' - Totally not, you shouldn't. 1st you should get a better GPU, and I mean a VERY GOOD GPU, ARMA 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd 'Why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play Singleplayer?' - Well ARMA is made for Coop action, and by this I mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th Buy it and you will see it will be worth it!
9781	1	a	Good game fixed most of the arma 2 bugs, has its own bugs but ehh :l something this big of a scale is going to be bound to have its bugs, Lags on lower end users and gives advantage to users with better graphical settings. my opinion the game deserves a 7/10.
9783	1	a	Arma 3 isn't a game about Shootin. It's About The Life Of Your Character It's about How Long you Can strive And Live It's About Flyig It's about Driveing It's About Liveing! Forget About Shooting let Your Vehicles Do It For You....This Is what THIS GAME IS ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

9787	1	a	This game has a massive emphasis on realism. That means the graphics are realistic. And everyone knows realistic graphics need a good graphics card for a computer. And everyone knows they need a good computer to have a good graphics card.

Replace 'terror' with 'frustration' and this game does, indeed, give you the True Combat experience written on the tin.  From the description and tutorial missions, I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like 'The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge, so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance.' Basically, I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot.  What I got is... nothing like that.  The single-player is more like what I would call a 'walking forward simulator.' Seriously, my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course, when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red 'TARGET' box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer, only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point.  After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought 'Okay, maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios, let me try that.' So, I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either.   There were scads of 'RPG' servers where I could play as a random villager, AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay, right?  There were 'Wasteland' servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ('fortify a base, gather supplies and hoard them') and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle, found nothing, shrugged and disconnected.  There were also 'King of the Hill' servers which at least featured combat. Well, actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away, which equated to a half-hour walk, a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush, which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So, helicopter was the obvious choice, but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town, I would jump out of the helicopter, open my parachute, and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town, I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top, but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head.  So, was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a 'free trial weekend' -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.
666	0	a	The DLC policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come.   Arma 3 has limited content, but guess what? If you pay extra, you get extra content. Why sell full game once, when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts?  I do not recommend.
667	0	a	Good Game. Game Good. Price-Not good. Dont buy it yet.
668	0	a	Over-priced, Over-hyped, Lacking in content - NOT WORTH IT. The developers re-use broken code from their earlier hits like Arma 2, Arma 1, Operation Flashpoint etc from 2001. The netcode is a DISASTER! Servers can barely handle more than 50 people and even then it's super laggy, rubber-banding and warping all over the place. The developers are now beginning to start releasing over-priced DLCs - 1. because they were too lazy to release the same content WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE ANYWAY in the game initial release 2. without fixing the basic game, typical money-grabbing tactic.
669	0	a	If your looking for a Good Mil Sim game then I suggest sticking with Arma2..Arma3 has seemed to have turned into a Role Playing game much like world of warcraft...mil sim servers are few and far between altis life dayz and the other role play aspects of arma3 have destroyed what the Arma series was meant to be..but I suppose BI needs to appeal to the masses. Its a well executed game..needs some tweaking but I am sure BI will update just as they did in Arma 2..just dont expect too much in the way of mil sim for what your going to pay for arma 3. Would I recommend this game? Depends..for someone who likes to role play like dayz and life games sure..but for anyone expecting what Arma 2 was..dont bother.

671	0	a	Its a simulation, but the AI is trash, so that leaves you playing with other players. Unfortunately, people as a group are absurdly uncoordinated, the only exception to this is when they have leadership. My generation, the one after me, and apparently the one before me (if voice-chat is any indicator) are the COD generations, This means they do not respond to authority or leadership well. For the groups of friends who join a server, squad up and play like a team, I truly commend you. To the brainless swarms who waste days upon days of time accruing fake money on wasteland servers venturing out into competetive servers only to hop into and immediately crash the helicopter... **** you. If youre lucky enough to have a group of 20 or so friends to play a game of ZEUS with, the game can really shine, failing that.... Just download a wasteland mod and pretend to be a lone wolf internet badass, because thats the future of this game.

677	0	a	You need all the DLCs or at least APEX DLC to be able to actually play arma 3 because the servers require the last DLC. You basically have to pay much more to be able to play. Hardly you'll find servers that dont require you to have APEX DLC. So instead of 35 Euros for the game, you gotta pay 60Euros. Enjoy.  by the way, they didnt fix their fps drops problems yet and they probably wont.
678	0	a	SP or anything that isnt a mod is a no go, wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead! If you do have it you should definately get the Breaking Point mod, plays better than the rest of the game.  *Update as of 1/13/15* Still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far...

694	0	a	horrible worst 40$ i have ever spent in my life!! never getting my money back...smh. first of all the game itself didn't work when i went into campaign mode. it froze on basic training mode right at the beginning and game me a white screen with building like blocks, And second when i tried downloading the 'arma 3: exile mode' (that was supposed to be like DAYZ but better) didnt even load into a server. kept telling me that i need to delete or find the missing keys or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! the whole reason i spent $40 was to play the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing exile mod! and that doesnt even work smh so now happy. if anyone can help me out and tell me what to do to play exile that would be greatly appreciated. thank you
695	0	a	I was half way into a mission. Driving a truck. I was told to stop at a check point. I don't know how to stop, so I hit the 'S' key. Apparently that's reverse. I was still moving forward, but the INSTANT I hit the S key, the truck changed from going forward to going backwards about a foot, which defies physics a bit, and it said I failed the mission for failing to follow orders (I guess going backwards 1 foot instead of 'stopping' at checkpoint). Have to start the whole mission over. Not sure if I'll play the game anymore.
9805	1	a	+ realistic + loads of mods + great soundtrack + mission making + great replay value +good community  - DLCs seem kind of dull. (except for apex) - in a lot of multiplayer games FPS will drop.   Great game, but the optimization may be a deal breaker for some.

705	0	a	  I played the free trial period for the weekend when the game was put on sale. I'm glad it was a free trial period. The first thing I, personally, didn't like was the time that this is supposed to be taking place. I'm sure that twenty years from now, the weapons systems, aircraft, gear, etc., will be more advanced than those portrayed in the game. The game's weapons systems, gear, etc., are obselete and are the currently utilitzed systems. Why not have the game take place in a more recent time?  Secondly, I wasn't too impressed with the movement, especially for vehicles. Seemed 'clunky' and a little old-school. I tried that mouse maneuvering of a vehicle which wasn't much better. I'm sure it would take practice, but my initial impressions weren't what I expected from a game that seems to receive a good rating.  Lastly, even though I palyed through the 'tutuorial,' there was still way too much guessing involved as to what keys or combination of keys were required to do whatever it was that needed to get done. Many of which could have been easily implemented into the tutorial so you could start off playing the game and know what keys do what. Very frustrating to say the least.  However, I like the idea of the game and the open environment. The graphics aren't the best but certainly acceptable. Sure, I only played this game for a few hours but my first impressions didn't live up to the expectations I thought I would see with a game rated the way it is. This, in my own opinion, is a game that should be on the $10 clearance rack at Walmart. Thank you for the free trial, but I'm going to pass on this one.
706	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my life im killing myself! ps this game always freezes!  *died*
9811	1	a	I tried to go down a slide.  Biggest mistake I ever made. Thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. Notify the government, slides are lethal. And to think we let children play on them. Science has gone too far I say!  10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.
711	0	a	Really wished i could recommend this but i can't. I've been on the ArmA train since Operation Flashpoints release and while ArmA II had a few things to wish for, ArmA 3 feels like a neverending Open Beta. The AI is godawfully dumb, unable to perform the simplest tasks without messing entirely up, the map itself is about as bland and boring as it can get, the 2035 theme is new but equally useless since most weapons and the entire scenario feel randomly thrown together with a few real life references.  Long story short, awful optimization, looks awful, feels bad, leaves a LOT to wish for, and it feels like the Community that once made Flashpoint the amazing thing it was has grown tired. Modding teams vanished with noone to replace them, most missions are coop with no care for atmospheric SP missions as it was with OFP... all in all it is far more of a techdemo than an actual game.
9813	1	a	It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.  The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the 'follower' category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.  It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.  While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to 'find cover' (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.  Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.  Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on 'Patrol' and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.  After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.  Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.  8/10
714	0	a	This game is a waste of money.... It's the buggiest game I ever played, sounds are late like Mexican movie... Player gets tired like he has a hangover, and the AI its on speed, its almost impossible to catch up... Man just don't buy this game I wasted 40 bucks on this terrible game....

9819	1	a	Brilliant game, can use some Help though some bugs are annoying..
9821	1	a	The Game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that Arma 3 is a great game for community development. Dev's out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions Bohemia Interactive provides in Arma 3. Many people buy this game just for the AMAZING addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. Arma is Intriguing to me because the game is UNPREDICTABLE. Games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. There can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with OPFOR. What do you do? Arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? I would give this game a 9/10

718	0	a	Do Not Buy this game,  If you're in to getting a half finished game of which half of the items require a second purchase of DLC then this game is perfect for you, if not then you may want to avoid this game. It is inevitable that more and more of what should have been in the original game will be charged for.   Some basic visuals, such as the way roads link together are still not fixed along with some vehicles having animations which result in a poorer gameplay experience. If you backed them during the Alpha you will have been completely ripped off by this company and even if you did not you will be in some form. The game is still playable without the DLC but guns and helicopters should have definitely been included in the price especially for the people who have backed the company from the start.   You will find that unlike arma 2 servers are already starting to die down with great numbers of servers being taken down due to insufficient funding. Arma 2 servers never had this issue due to the large number of players on servers and the replayability of the game, yes I have a lot of hours on this game however it does not make up for the fact that it is meerely designed to squeeze money out of you. I refuse to pay for DLC which is not fairly priced for their supporters. Companies such as this one should re-evaluate their stance to the market before the PC Gaming community heavily turn against companies proposing to release large amounts of DLC. This has already been demonstrated by fans of the upcoming title 'Total War: Warhammer' where thousands disliked a video of a planned DLC in order to get their point across.   Companies will continue to take the P*ss until we take a stand against them.

722	0	a	Don't be deceived by the trailers, Arma 3 gives you the impression its a more tactical Battlefield shooter. It is that by all means, but it's centered around the tactical aspect. Missions can take up to 3 hours to complete and just the training is enough to throw a seasoned shooter off. Training will have you snipping targets with an assault riffle. I get that most ex soldiers in the US today enjoy this game because it's very similar to real life hostile engagements, but I honestly felt like I was having to camp like I see bad players doing in Call of Duty. More power to you if that's what you like to do, but I for one enjoy Halo, Gears of War, Rainbow Six, and Ghost Recon. So I didn't get that close ranged tactical cover to cover neck snapping stealth urge I needed satisfied. I don't recommend this game quite simply because the type of game it is, not so much it being bad, because it's surely not a bad game. I play Warframe way too much so I wanted something a bit slower and more tactical. This game seems to be nothing but that. Too much so for me. Just download and try it. The first 40 minutes should give you enough to decide rather or not its for you.
9837	1	a	I love how there is so many other gamemodes to play my favorite to play is Atlis life its just so much fun and i cant see any problem with this game
9839	1	a	Just get it and stop looking down here...
9841	1	a	Gud game 2 lern armee stoof
9843	1	a	God make this game
9845	1	a	It's ok
9847	1	a	I need it xD buy me!
9849	1	a	first time playing got robbed and my kidney stolen 10/10
9851	1	a	Good game i like it ,but there is bugs.
9853	1	a	Had this game for quite a while - original review was actually made in oct 2014 - but didn't play it much due to gamebreaking bugs. But its Nov 2016 now and much changed.  I must say, after these 2 years, it matured damn well! See below for more information.  Conclusion: If you loved Arma 2, or if you love simulation/sandbox games, military topics and a very customizable battle experience, get this. It's worth it.  Some people may call the DLCs a bit overkill in terms of pricing, I must say, ~10â‚¬ for about 2 more helicopters is not quite nice.  BUT  theres the DLC Bundle! 17â‚¬ for all 3 DLCs that would else cost you 22â‚¬! I'm all for it, the developers deserve it after working so hard and even including great new features for free in the main game instead of just in the DLCs.  Please note that APEX is  NOT  to be comparised to the other DLCs! See it as Operation Arrowhead of Arma 2. It adds so much content that - even though I currently can't afford it - it sure is worth the price.  Now theres still much to do to keep this title afloat and BI seems to have still quite some surprises in their roadmap for us as well. Even though my initial reaction was tending to negative on Arma 3 back then, I can only have good hopes now.
9855	1	a	Wish I didn't get rid of this game
9857	1	a	10/10 would shoot a police officer again
9859	1	a	Kids play Call of Duty  Boys play Battlefield  Men play Arma
9861	1	a	This game is hard. You jump out of a building-splat-dead. You are walking aroung- bang-dead. You are in a tank-mine explodes-dead. However,once you learn all of the tricks(about 75 hours for me) it starts to get really rewarding. This game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks, you can fly helicopters, fixed wing, and drones. You can drive tons of vehicles, or you can just walk around as a rifleman. Use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking, download mods to (nearly) perfect your game. A.I. is kinda glitchy, some textures aren't perfect but overall, FANTASTIC GAME. Seriously, one of my friends NEEDS to buy this so we can play together.
9863	1	a	Exile mod is the only good thing this game. And also wasteland mod! Don't bother with single player or the official servers.
9865	1	a	Having fun playing CityLifeRPG look it up  http://community.cityliferpg.com/ 
9867	1	a	I can't picture my life without this game. *cries* This game does not get any better for a military simulation. So many hours never bored.  10/10
9869	1	a	It's k.
9871	1	a	So let me tell you a story. There's little old me Just wondering through the amazing countryside as you do. The colours were amazing the lighting and sounds were great, I just met up with my friend and we were having a great time. Then all of a suden, out of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing no where i get headshoted from a thousand meters away! 10/10 would rage quit again :D
9873	1	a	Arma, the only game where you can call people who don't camp noobs.
9875	1	a	ArmA 3 is the definitive warfare simulator.  
9877	1	a	Ground combat. Air combat. Underwater combat. Vehicular combat. THIS GAME HAS A LOT OF COMBATS!   And yeah.. It's not perfect but it's really fun if you find a unit.  11/10
9879	1	a	Arma 3 is the most expensive game on steam. Only people who work at NASA can afford it, this is because you require a degree in quantum physics to be able to remember the controls and move.
9881	1	a	Come Join My New Server! Help me expand my Player Base and help the server become popular Arma 3 Epoch with all-terrainpack enabled. - 88.150.150.250:2382 temaspeak 3 - 85.236.100.27:19147
9883	1	a	TL;DR its a great tactical simulator very well pollished  This is a Mitlitary Silulator Not another C.O.D.   the level of detail is amazing the visuals are stunning.  FPS can be a problem as it is very CPU heavy ( 60fps is achievable but dont expect to be on ultra )  audio is stunning local voip is actually based on player location and rifle sounds effects are great  the workshop is a great aid for mods and extra content very easy to use
9885	1	a	The base game I would give 80/100.....with all the great mods people put together for it I would give it a 90/100. This is due to the fact some of the mods are still.....meh....to say the least. Great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts.
9887	1	a	The best realistic simulation shooter
9889	1	a	Military 'Simulator', tons of community content, flexible modding. Still some bugs that needs fixing though. 8.5/10 - highly recommended.
9891	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome.
9893	1	a	I bouth this game in Alpha for 20 euro, now its for 45 euro. Enjoy
736	0	a	Such a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders, buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.
9895	1	a	very gewd much yes
737	0	a	multiplayer is a broken mess!
9897	1	a	its a great game if you like tactical gameplay
9899	1	a	pretty good, but very laggy for my pc, ill buy the full version once i buy myself a super computer
738	0	a	the game is supper glichy
9901	1	a	Must buy. Great game, gameplay is much more fluid than Arma 2, and mods and user created content provide endless gameplay. grab some buds, make a squad, and go kick some â™¥â™¥â™¥!
739	0	a	waste of freaking money. the game runs like crap, the aiming freaking sucks and theres freaking invisible enemies that can kill you even though yoju cant see them. worst game ever i regret buying this piece of crap!
9903	1	a	Where is the fire button? 
740	0	a	Very realistic, but doesn't run multiplayer at high frames.
9905	1	a	You can do stuff in this game
9907	1	a	Great gameplay, great visuals, sounds, and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. In my opinion the most noticeable improvement since Arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world, as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar 'checkpoints' in previous games. The gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains, making Arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than 'just' an advanced FPS with 'milsim' elements into it. However, it is impossible to talk honestly about Arma 3 without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably, but not only), the lack of weapons and few annoying Ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well).  That being said, I personally can see an insanely great potential behind Arma 3, and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. All it needs is some more time to grow up.
743	0	a	HOW TO KILL TANKS THE SIMULATION WAY: Walk against them and they will flip.  The game where you can't even play the tutorial mission because of broken scripts (restarted 3 times, the third time my character even had a different voice)  Want a game where you can survive more headshots than in Call of Duty? Then this game is for you. It's the future. Your helicopter can actually land on enemy soldiers without them seeing it! That's the stealth we need. Enemy AI only shoots you since it knows the game is won for them then.   What's the difference between glass windows and mountains? We will never know. AI will shoot right through it. Oh well, you can't kill them trough glass windows! Just like in real life.   This is actually the least realistic game I have ever played in my whole life. But no one plays it for it's military aspects anyway - Arma 3 Altis Life is where all the players sit. (because this military sim is oh-so-realistic.)  Fanbase in this game, or should I say fanboys, are incapable of understanding what this game is supposed to be anyway. Do you believe all the 12 year old veterans? Hell yeah.   I do like the fact that this game has an editor, even if it's quite horrible compared to the other games featuring an editor.  The developer also doesn't care anything about this game. My tank literally explodes from driving against a fence at 5 kp/h. Just like in real life!   The other only positive aspect I can think of are the graphics, which are very nice. And no my friends, the graphics aren't badly optimized, it's the scripts, which basically are the only things that this game has.  1/10. Can't rate it better for what it's supposed to be, especially not when compared to other games.
744	0	a	If you wanna play life RPG's this is the game. There are rarely servers for TDM, LMS, CTF, or control. Its not even war. All of the servers are life RPG's. I was expecting way more out of this game. A WASTE OF $40..... Money back would be much appreciated... If this company has any heart..
745	0	a	Not worth the price. Not even close. Do not buy this game. Especially if you don't have an organized group to play with.
746	0	a	BUGS, BUGS AND MORE BUGS, CANT EVEN LOAD THE CAMPAIGN WITHOUT IT CRASHING. Quite annoyed as i played about 7 hours before the bugs hit me and i cant get a refund.
9909	1	a	Great game if youre in a team with friends that played before
747	0	a	Extreme lag needs optimization, would not recommend to anyone that can only run minecraft on their computer like me
748	0	a	i loved the game even tho i suck at it but its not optimized i see fish swimming on land water physics floating on land and the fact i payed 250$ CAD on my headset (7.1 suround sound) and i still cant tell where ppl are shooting from or where footsteps are coming from. AND the fact i have a grphix card thats in the recrierment(cant spell) i cant these damn memory log crashes where my momory cant read the info. i think i got a good modded computer where i can play Fallout 4 in ultra setting minus motion blur but still be able to tell where a bandit is shooting from, other than that my settings are MAXED (solid 45fps) and no memory issues at all this game needs more updating i keep crashing cuz of these memory dumps that couldnt be read by my computer. it doesnt stop there it crashes in single player mode and online and the crash reports basiclly told me to update/downgrade my GPU...... OR go to another server. base line if ppl want my opinion if you got mid-line GPU its not worth the price tag these guy need to work on bug fixes big time.
749	0	a	this is a great game at its core but horrible optimization and bad players ruins it.
750	0	a	I'm going to be short on this one. The game is great, not a little, it is really great. But, I am giving it a negative review for I cannot play it properly for a very simple reason: I cannot stand its gunshot sounds. I am not whining over this, the thing is that I have an ear sensibility and I cannot stand high pitched sounds, period. For me, Arma 2 sounds are totally fine, I know that people in general gave Arma 2 sounds a bad rating, for me they are ok. There are other people over the internet who complain over this gunshot sound issue, they are simply too loud. I know that in real life they sound exactly how they sound in Arma 3 but, in real life, one also wears headphones to muffle the real gunshot sound, so, no, I do not need real gunshot sound in a game (considering that I use headphones for playing), I care for my ear health. I sent a support ticket to Bohemia: maybe they can add a slider for gunshot sound, maybe they can add an option to disable this very high sound dynamic range, I don't know if they can/want to do this. I was on the verge of buying the Apex expansion but I stopped because of this issue. If they don't do anything then, unfortunately, I have to stay with Arma 2 or other arcade shooters, what can I do. I am really looking forward for the devs to come up with a solution for this issue. If they do then I will change this review.
9911	1	a	Great Combat simulator however realistic vehicle damage and pysics is highly lacking. Oh and make sure you have a good pc otherwise expect 15 frames.
9913	1	a	People's necks start glitching out in the back of helicopters. 10/10 would see a doctor again.
9915	1	a	Very good game! And easy to play even for begingers! I totaly recommend this game!
9917	1	a	I'm not skilled at this game, yet, though I do find that this is definitely something that I would recommend. Here is what I find great about Arma 3:   Absolutely amazing graphics and visual effects   The most realistic military simulator out there, no doubt about it   The voice commands in the game are smooth and consistent   You want tanks? Boom, have a tank. You want helicopters? Then have a helicopter! It's all in one great game!  There are many more things about Arma 3 that make it awesome, one list simply can't do Arma 3 justice. I have no regrets for purchasing this game at full price. If I were to have but one complaint, it's that it's hard to  git gud .
9919	1	a	This game was released as an incomplete game, but content is added on a regular basis. In a couple of years it'll actually be worth the $30 price tags it'll be by then. I don't recommend it at its current price, but overall it's a very solid military simulation game.
752	0	a	well done,old campaign saves not working,thx .....not buying apex *thumbs up* in more than 20 years wall glitch still possible,wow,well done as well,sorry, im done with you behomia! You are just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding and mess around with players, Hall had reasons to leave and im quiet confident why... Dayz was a ripp off,like the whole series,im really sorry to say that,but i was a big fan ....flashpoint(the raly first one) flashed me so hard and thats you behave over years of loyality.... im done.....im so mad
9921	1	a	69/10
9923	1	a	Really cool game, nice graphics and fun gamemodes!
757	0	a	Uses OFP engine from 10 years ago. Recommends GTX 560, I have 580 and NEVER get more than 20 fps no matter what my settings are. This game was made by dirty slavaboo gopniks who have no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing clue what they're doing.
758	0	a	INVALED SCREEN HELP ME PLS.
759	0	a	So I bought this game on the summer sale, it looks really hard in the trailers and in the gamplay reviews but, the controles are really messed up and its hard to do anything in the game. I think that when they make arma 4 they should put in normal controles and less controles like E should do more then just one thing. I really think that arma 4 should be a little less hardcore and more user friendly.  thanks
760	0	a	Not Fun &amp; setting up controls was almost enough stopping playing instantaneously
761	0	a	Absolute garbage. Complete Alpha Crap. Buggy as all â™¥â™¥â™¥. 2/10
762	0	a	This game is totaly waste of money for amd owners.  Getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage.   Fps around 15-30 with high settings and it's dramaticly same with low settings too.  Not optimized for amd cpu - apu.  Totaly unplayable for amd owners.  I opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.
763	0	a	i thought sunday was a weekend day.
764	0	a	so meny bugs around.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that game.
765	0	a	How could this still be this bad.. still playing arma2 witch is much better
766	0	a	Arma 3 is easy to explain. Imagine arma 2. Now add proper stances to it, ALOT better performance, alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. Arma 3 is a good game for what it is. The main problem is: the devs are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy, they didn't bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2, instead, 4 or 5 that just have different skins. About 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 Helicopters and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me, only one â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing jet. I mean thats â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy. The amount of content in arma 3 is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. Bohemia Interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha, or very early beta. NOT a finished game. Overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not, its down to you. If you want a game that runs and plays really well, if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets, then get it. If you can't however, just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. Again, this game should be in late alpha - early beta. NOT a finished game.
9925	1	a	One of the best mil-sims / combat-sims ever made, definatly worth the $60
773	0	a	If you like never being able to leave spawn, 12 year olds screaming in your ears and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hitler level admins banning you because you called them out for their own rules then buy this game other than that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you arma i tried to love this game but nawh im done same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t day in day out peace out and ill be back when you can make this an enjoyable game again.
9927	1	a	Its a good game, but they need to stop being such stingy jews and lower the damn price.
775	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE LAG! I have a very high end PC and this piece of trash struggles to get over 40fps in signle player mode.
776	0	a	Do you like headaches? this game is headache game
777	0	a	Hard to control!
778	0	a	Well... what to say about this game in two words. Its Bad.   Arma 3 is terribly optimized for PC. Mine isn't the greatest, but I saw someone who had two 980s try running it, didn't even get over 50 FPS. Never knew you needed a $4,000 computer to even get over 60 FPS. The servers are terrible, there are rarely any servers that are populated with a &lt;150 ping. Even if I try to connect to any of them, it says connection failed. People may have thought I made a bad review because of how difficult and realistic it was. I like games like this. Too bad bohemia interactive didn't put enough effort into making this game run really well, and to make the server connection good. Instead of fixing these problems and making announcements about them, they decide to release DLC after DLC to add onto this broken game. If you are stupid enough to pay $15 for two helicopters, you must not be too wise with your money. I should have mentioned, when getting into a server, you must either donate or go into ts to fly. Why can't they just use game chat? Guess I will never get my pilot license. They probably sould have fixed arma 2 as well, before making this one. I refuse to run this on the LOWEST POSSIBLE settings, because there is no reason I should. A game like this, you need good view distance, and things need to looks some what nice. You can't see an enemy a few thousand meters out, but they sure can see you. Please DO NOT buy this game unless it goes on sale. This game is nowhere near worth $60. I would say its worth 20-30 range.
779	0	a	While I love the Arma series, this game was not was I was expecting. When you make a game, you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game.   1. A setting - They created the island, and it was good, very large and open with a diverse landscape  2. The Engine - Everything works well, even the physics, which Arma 2 completely failed at. Movements are fluid, you got way better animations, so there aren't any complaints....until  3. Weapons and Vehicles - This is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game, and I am sad to say that BI failed miserably. They created virtually nothing for the game's release, for what reason I don't know, but it aggravates me to no end. You have all the things in place, the tools for people to make their own missions, but there is no variety, same guns, same ammo, and a couple of vehicles. Look at Arma 2, even without the DLC, there was TONS of content to work with, and the DLC just added onto that.   My advice? Keep up to date on the status of the game, and once the first DLC comes out, THEN buy it
780	0	a	Once again the community doesn't do any justice. Almost all servers are hosted in Brazil, mods are galore. Expect no vanilla game at all in the server browser. Expect no one to help you out, or work tactically, or be approachable at all. Aimbot is inevitable.  5/10
781	0	a	controls are clunky, horribly optimized, graphics suck, AI sucks and in some missions actively tries to get you killed.   and yet i keep trying out of pure boredom.  
782	0	a	This is gonna be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for arma 3 But its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on arma 3 for dayz You guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people
783	0	a	n3xt g3n, load into a server nek m1nn1t crash
784	0	a	Buggy as hell. They never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls.  Hard to tell when you've actually shot someone. No real visual indicator that you've shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. Single player campaign seems badly thought out. I basically had to save scum to get off of the first island.  AI is awful. No armory mode or quick mission mode.  I regret buying this in alpha.
785	0	a	I will never ever buy another mistake (Bohemia Interactive game). I trusted this company and purchased this game in Alpha. Not only did they deliver a buggy failure. They have the nerve of releasing expensive DLCs that are meant to be included in the game. And announcing new games when they haven't even finished whats on their plate. This developer should be renamed as EA v2.1  Never again BI, never again.
786	0	a	(free weekend)   GTX 760, intelcore I5, windows 8.1 (64 bit), 8 gigs of ram, directX 11, and the game still runs like crap on the lowest setting. do not recommend.
787	0	a	I played 11 hours on the free weekend, and i use to enjoy the flashpoint series but found this game hard to get into and the missions seemed the same most of the time. Only the first episode was available for free but it seemed the same, run through some trees shoot a few enemy then go to objective, shoot a few more, complete objective wait 2 minutes then mission ends.   Couldnt connect to any multiplayer servers so maybe this game is too old now and no one hosts severs for it in the Pacific region?  I might pick it up on the sale again if its 60-70% off but 50% off and I will still hold out on it for now.
788	0	a	They should really fix this game performace wise, performs like one of the first AAA games that were demanding on PC. Cant say i can recommend it due to all the performance issues, and i run 2x 970 STRIX in SLI and got a high end Intel CPU, and even with those startup commands it doesnt fix much.
789	0	a	Why play Arma 3 when you could be putting your genitals into meat mincer which would be a lot more fun. I feel like Ive been robbed! Definitely not worth Â£35.99 -_-
790	0	a	so good to install and unninstal! plz try  
791	0	a	I thought I would love this game, but after dealing with sloppy menu systems, unoptimized game settings, and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay, I just wish I never spent the money on this. All the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that you'll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak.  
792	0	a	Awful. Way too complicated and clunky to be fun.
793	0	a	This game don't deserve much love,bad performance,mouse bug at start can't click anything,controls are bit weird mostly when you try to aim it zoom...whatever,ordinary graphics (played Ultra 1080p) with 2009 polygon count.On foot graphics runs better with people shooting and all that good action than flying on helicopter that you only can see ugly ground texture with some trees with no action...weird. Grass looks to much like paper really ugly. Yeah you can make scenarios and yeah the map is huge yeah it's a sandbox but no it's not that great. To many people likes it,takes a hater,i rarely hate games but Arma 3...i hate it.
9929	1	a	Great game, you will get your moneys worth
9931	1	a	Great war simulator. Way better than all these arcade shooters. In this game, you have to think strategically and be careful, because mechanics is demanding. It has developed multiplayer and many huge mods like Breaking Point, Exile etc. Campaign is more difficult than other games' campaignes, but multiplayer has many different kinds of servers. You will be satisfied. 9/10
9933	1	a	Fun game. Really fun for mucking around or just surviving online. Huge map. Great with mods (zombie survival mods such as Zoombies). Must play shooter.
9935	1	a	Very nice game i played arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead and they have step it up really nicely the multiplayer server engines could be a bit better but apart from that it's a masterpiece of Fps games.
9937	1	a	one of the Quad A games out there ( AAAA ) :D Best game ever in my opinion   i r8 8/8 m8 w8 88/8 m80
9939	1	a	If you enjoyed Codemasters â€œOperation Flashpointâ€ in 2001, then you will absolutely love ARMA III. ARMA III takes place on two different islands: Altis &amp; Stratis. Stratis is 19 square kilometers (7.3 sq. km), with few roads and rugged forested terrian. Altis, on the other hand, is huge at 270 square kilometers (104.2 sq. mi.), with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills. However, only ~5% of the roads on Altis are paved.  There is a lot of detail put in this game, including some indigenous fauna, such as snakes, rabbits, goats, dogs, insects, and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters. They do not do anything but move around, but it adds to the realism. Did I mention snakes? There are a huge number of snakes on Altis.  Movement is not restricted. Meaning, you can move anywhere you like. Including using a re-breather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks, just for kicks. There are lots of vehicles to choose from, both civilian and military. Weapons, ammunition, and equipment can be taken from the dead. However, only take what you can carry during the missions. If you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission. You will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying.  The game includes a single-player campaign broken into three episodes:  Survive = 8 required missions, plus 6 optional scouting missions Adapt = 9 required missions, plus 8 optional scouting missions. Win = 6 required missions, no optional scouting missions.  When you complete the first required mission for each episode, return to base, and told to report in â€“ don't. If you report in, then you will be assigned the next required mission. Instead, go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standing/sitting, and listen to what they have to say. This is how you get optional missions. Then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission, if you so desire. When you have completed your scouting mission(s), then return to base and report in for your next required mission.  All the missions, except for the last one, are linear and static. Meaning, nothing you do will change the course of events. Except for the last mission. In the last mission you have to make a decision, and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission.  There is a steep learning curve, and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning. If you are new to ARMA III, then I recommend enabling the â€œSave Gamesâ€ in the Game Options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration. The Survive missions are all solo, so you have time to adapt and learn the controls. The Adapt and Win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command. By the time you complete the campaign (~30 hours) you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands, both individually and as a group.  ARMA III is more than just a â€œFirst-Person-Shooter,â€ it is a first-person combat simulator. The weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance. The three different stances (prone, crouching, and standing) will effect how much your weapon recoils, which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy. Standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1,000 meters is not recommended.  ARMA III allows user-developed mods, and also includes DLCs. Once you have completed the campaign, and want more single-player or multiplayer campaigns, then I recommend subscribing to the â€œDynamic Universal War Systemâ€ in the Steam Workshop. The DUWS mod will randomly create new campaigns, with as many missions as you desire. The goal of the campaign is always the same â€“ control of the island.  There are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out, but it is very playable as is. I definitely recommend ARMA III.
800	0	a	I HATE THIS! every time I attempt to accses a server or game im always transfared back to the main title server screen due to 'unknown errors'/ error code : 0x0000DEAD- why to I have to deal with this every time I try to connect to a server... Â£14.99 wasted, thanks....!!!!
9941	1	a	Bad Optimization but I can't say whole is bad.
802	0	a	Everything about this game improves on Arma II except for one key point. The game simply does not run. Not on high end machines, not on anything, it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). Online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. If this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. Until that time i cannot recommend this game.
803	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to ARMA2. Gear loadout saving process is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and not working, optimization is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. In other words, it's a downgrade. Keep playing ARMA2 until this game is patched/fixed
9943	1	a	Great game :D
9945	1	a	Best Military Game 10/10.
9947	1	a	game isnt realistic tbqh if i was really a solider i wouldbe owning n000bs and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ womyn like are they mad?
804	0	a	I regret buying the DLC... The karts are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ly stupid. The rifles are total BS garbage.... and the helicopters I can get from Armaholic or Play withSIX. Just get Play withSix and download weapons mods, vehicles etc... If I could do it over again I wouldn't pay $1 for the DLC that should have been included wiith the game to begin with. The game ARMA 3 is awesome... The DLC is underhanded.
9949	1	a	love the game would like a dynamic campaign to be included
9951	1	a	fantastic shooter/milatary sim butstill need to fix mini bugs but they dont really matter :D
9953	1	a	Its arma
9955	1	a	THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE !!!  If you are looking for a realistic game with the best developers that listen to there community, a community that is always active in any game mode you play, a modding community that is always making and updating new content for the game and a game that will stay in your heart forever this is what you are looking for. YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH OUT OF THIS GAME, and trust me I have over 1000 hours and looking forward to many more to enjoy.
810	0	a	This is not a good game  It's still not optimized enough to run over 60fps on KoTH on my rig (8GB 1333mhz RAM, GTX760, i5 3570k, win10)  
9957	1	a	i dont own it
9959	1	a	+1
821	0	a	Wouldn't recommend, it's a broken game with lots of bugs in it.   Need to mod it up to make it look half decent.   
822	0	a	Brain damage isn't the word.. If you love walking about hill sides &amp; empty towns for hours on end then by all means knock your self clean out. Really good graphics, Half decent engine but just awful gameplay. Trying to even see who is launching nades and rounds at you is a fecking personal nightmare. Could feel myself falling asleep in one game where a guy was flying for an hour with me in the back of a chopper.. and yes.. we met no enemy the entire time. 4/10 just for graphics
9961	1	a	everyone need to try out this game
823	0	a	I thought this game was AMAZIING at first, since I has seen videos on Youtube, but then when I got into the game, I realized that it was a rip off for SIXTY DOLLARS! The game is very realistic, but maybe a bit TOO realistic. You get tired like every five seconds in the game so you cant sprint for a very long time, which makes the game boring, because it takes forever to get anywhere. The game is also very hard to understand at first, and the turorial is very confusing when you start. If you are buying this game for graphics or/and realism, then its a yes, but if you are buying this game for fun and lots of action, you should pass on this one.
9963	1	a	Its Fun especially Altis Life :D
9965	1	a	my favrate game recomended at six stars
9967	1	a	This game is awesome and really realistic with cool graphics! Good Job! 
9969	1	a	One of the most realistic military tactical shooters!
9971	1	a	This combines the FPS that every serious FPS military gamer would want to play, It has great customization for your apparel, the guns are also easily customizable and it looks great on ultra high, even better is the fact that it has a very active gaming community and workshop items are constantly being added. Also, when you kill people you can rob their pants. 11/10
9973	1	a	You can kill goats 4.20/5
9975	1	a	the gud guds
9977	1	a	It's THE BEST.
829	0	a	I decided to try Arma 3 as everyone was recommending online.I am going to start out with this game does need some work to be put in not worth to spend full price on this pick up when on a good sale other then that this game isn't for people who like fast paced action now performance issues I apperently run into with other complications. Firstly so I got 20 fps everything maxed to lowered it still some 20fps terrible port needs to be compressed properly controls are also clunky I would say the simulation at the start was 60fps but once it ended fps dropped drasticaly. Secondly I would recommend trying to run with a single GTX 980 &amp; 970 or AMD equevelent never crossfire or SLI not responsible if fps will stay the same usually I get over 60fps maxed out in games but this one you probably should use a controler since it's not K&amp;m friendly. Lastly lets not forget the story you run to point A to B. I know it's supposed to be realistic but we customers need playable material this rant is to prove that servers have connection problems sometimes you get kicked from online most of the time I get messages saying Arma 3 stopped working as I play through don't get this garbage unless this is below $10/7.89 EU or $5/3.95 EU please Bohemia Interactive fix this trash and make it playable.People with 770s,780s,and 280s,and 290s are really dissapointed that this game doesn't run well on their machines an utter dissapointment to people who dedicated their money on powerful pc hardware just to have 20 fps? In summary not worth buying this game since it isn't demanding but more unoptimized unfinished product this is a spit on PC Gamers and their rigs and before you say something to defend early access let me tell you something Valve needs to work on testing this games before letting them be published on steam conclusion don't buy it not worth your time unless you like capped down ports then support the video game monkeys who make video games this bad and horrible.   Final rating 5.5/10 for Walking Simulator
830	0	a	do you like wandering around in the middle of no where for 2hrs just to get killed one min into combat? do you love admin abuse? well boy do i have a game for you! its called arma 3 , if you like a whole lot of walking around and doing nothing , your gonna love this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
9979	1	a	I rarely play online, and don't do much single player. I have no idea how i have 100 hours, it must be good.
9981	1	a	Its like Arma 2, exept this one has graphics.
832	0	a	Worst experiance I ever had. I constantly get kicked from servers for having a high ping, but in reallity my ping is always 80 or below. The game seems fun but, i'll never get to find out.
9983	1	a	When it comes to writing a review for this game, I really don't even know what to say. This series has always been a go to for me, basically since the beginning of my PC gaming days, I was playing OFP in 2001. Over the years this series has entertained me longer than any other i've ever played. There is absolutely no competition to ArmA, no game/simulator comes even close to what arma has to offer, or even comes close to the gameplay experience ArmA has. As any ArmA veteran knows, there is some humps you need to tackle to get use to the game. It's not a game a where you can just join a server and play like battlefield or red orchestra. That's not how the game is structured. It's not a game where you can play it natively, it is not designed in a structured gameplay style what-so-ever. This isn't a game where you can play by yourself( Well, you could...). It's hard to explain to the average-gamer what this game is about. It's a platform and if you're playing it without utilizing the very nature of the game is not going to result in the ideal experience you have heard about. You need to have a community of players, small or large, and 3rd party content to form the game into the GAME you want this PLATFORM to be. The average content pack is at least 10gb, but you should expect 20+gb of content. The game is designed to be modified. Arma 3 has no asset content and ArmA 2 is merely a skeleton of a game body. Explaining to the average player that they need to download a special program and install 10s of gigabytes of content is difficult, it sounds like hard work. Your average player doesn't want to 'work' to get the game into a playable state. That's understandable, but that's not what this game is about. It's so versatile for a reason, so groups of people can make the game exactly how they want it. It's really almost too much to explain, all I can say is that if you give this game a chance, and you put in the work for the first time around to set it up, it's amazing. It is absolutely unmatched. Almost every issue you are going to hear about this game comes down to user error. If people are complaining about the AI, and the futuristic content( or the lack of content), that is entirely because they are not using the game to it's potential. If you don't alter the game meant to be altered, you're going to have a bad experience. The same concept can be applied to performance. I'm sure if you've looked up ArmA, you're probably wondering if you can run it. It is true that arma is a heavy game to run, but that usually is not the source of the problem. 90% of the people complaining about lag are running the game on weak computers that just cannot run arma. The game is not considerably unoptimized, it does have some networking issues, but they are hardly the cause of any major performance problem. This is an intensive game, 5 years ago you could not even dream to see what arma is providing. In a couple years, it will be much more easy to run given the bound-to-happen advancements in hardware. It also comes down to the mission maker and the server hoster, if you don't run your servers right, you are going to give your players bad performance. This game does not babysit you, and you should not expect it to. If you know what you are doing, and you have a decent computer, you will run this game with no problem at all. I hope you take the time to try it, and don't blame everything you are uncapable to do on Bohemia. There is very few things I can say that have made an impact on my life that aren't real, maybe 1 other game out of the hundreds that i've played. ArmA is one of those, there is some great, hilarious experiences in ArmA that I think I will remember the rest of my real life. Not many games can do that.
9985	1	a	Great game, The campaign is supprisingly epic ( i don't like campaigns that much ) Battle Royale mod is just amazing to play :3
9987	1	a	Have passed 480+ hours on this steam account and still enjoy it! You should check out the modding community, love all the mods including Altis Life, Exile, Epoch and Arma 3 Project Life. You should atleast give the community a try, since its the community what makes this game so great!
9989	1	a	good game, can flip cars with go-karts
9991	1	a	Any one selling arma 3 cheap as a gift? add me i have paypal and ROK willing to trade
834	0	a	*slow clap* nice way to go all EA on us and wait to release half the end game content in dlc, get aggressive cancer bohemia devs.
835	0	a	In my opinion the second game is much more fun. I don't really like the setting, and the game is just not Arma. This game is more like 'Arma: Tactical Roleplay Altis Life'.
9993	1	a	My most played game on steam ever.
9995	1	a	So many cool gamemodes to try out and have fun with your friends with!
9997	1	a	I hit a jump and randomly catapulted 1km in the sky, then got taken out by an anti air missile.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 10/10
9999	1	a	-Awesome Graphic -Great Military simulation -Have many mode  worth to buy 10/10
